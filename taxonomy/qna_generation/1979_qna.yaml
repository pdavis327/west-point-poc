      In seeking to improve the management of its human and physical resources, the
      Army moved ahead in a number of areas. Adivision restructuring study assessed
      the organization of the Army's heavy combat divisions, and experiments using
      alternative structures containing smaller but more numerous maneuver elements
      began. Based upon ideas contained in a study completed in fiscal year 1978, the
      Army brought about a number of changes to improve the training and education of
      individual officers. In the management of installations, facilities, and
      equipment, energy conservation increased, industrial pollution decreased,
      property accountability improved, and escalating base operating costs were
      checked. Continued reliance on automation and the proliferation of individual
      automated data systems has focused attention on the integration,
      interoperability, survivability, and security of the various systems. In October
      1978, the Office ofthe Assistant Chief of Staff for Automation and
      Communications was established to manage the integration of technologies in
      these rapidly expanding fields.

          in the fields of automation and communications?
        answer: The Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Automation and Communications
      - question: |-
          What were the main areas in which the Army sought to improve its management of
          human and physical resources?
        answer: |-
          The Army sought to improve its management of human and physical resources
          through division restructuring, changes in the training and education of
          individual officers, better management of installations, facilities, and
          equipment, and focus on the integration, interoperability, survivability, and
          security of automated data systems.
      - question: |-
          Given the focus on energy conservation, decreased industrial pollution, improved
          property accountability, and controlled base operating costs, can we infer that
          the Army's management of installations, facilities, and equipment became more
          efficient?
        answer: |-
          Yes, we can infer that the Army's management of installations, facilities, and
          equipment became more efficient.
  - context: |-
      In 1979, U.S. Army, Europe, was about 200,000 soldiers strong, or more than a
      quarter the strength of the active Army. With the exception of Brigade 75 (which
      had transferred in late January to northern Germany) and the Berlin Brigade,
      USAREUR was assigned to the Central Army Group. U.S. Army, Europe, contained
      four divisions, four separate brigades, and two armored cavalry regiments. The
      forces were becoming stronger, both armored and mechanized, an expression of
      shock action and firepower directed at Soviet advances. For example, cavalry
      units exchanged their Sheridans for M60's, 210 Cobra/ TOW's in ten companies
      were installed on the ground, and armored units increased the size of their tank
      crews. Artillery forces had been strengthened by the arrival of three battalions
      of medium and heavy artillery (with increases in the number of tubes for every
      battery) and adoption of a novel uploading system to quicken the responses of
      ammunition units alerted for battle. Additional infusions of equipment and
      technology were to follow, and progress was so sure that in 1978 a proposal was
      made to turn over to Germany nearly all the base management operations. The
      proposal, referred to as USAREUR-An Army Deployed, would be negotiated with the
      NATO allies and would better enable the Army to prepare for war.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How many soldiers were in U.S. Army, Europe in 1979?
        answer: 200,000 soldiers
      - question: What measures were taken to strengthen the U.S. Army, Europe in
          the late 70s?
        answer: |-
          Cavalry units exchanged their Sheridans for M60's, 210 Cobra/ TOW's in ten
          companies were installed on the ground, armored units increased the size of
          their tank crews, three battalions of medium and heavy artillery with increased
          number of tubes for every battery and a novel uploading system to quicken the
          responses of ammunition units alerted for battle were added, and a proposal was
          made to turn over to Germany nearly all the base management operations.
      - question: |-
          Based on the information provided, why was the proposal to turn over base
          management operations to Germany beneficial for the U.S. Army, Europe?
        answer: |-
          The proposal was beneficial as it would better enable the Army to prepare for
          war by allowing them to focus more on military readiness and less on base
          management operations.

      In the other global trouble spot where the Army stood on guard, it was a year of
      discovery and surprise. The withdrawal of the 2d Infantry Division from its
      sectors in South Korea, announced by President Carter in 1977, had been based on
      a favorable assessment ofthe peninsular balance. But in 1978, new intelligence
      indicated that the earlier estimate had been overly optimistic, that North
      Korea's forces, the forth largest in the communist world, had much more
      capability to launch an invasion of the Republic of Korea than anyone in Seoul
      or Washington had previously thought. In July 1979 the President decided to
      temporarily freeze combat withdrawals. Certain supporting units would still
      depart in 1980, but air defense units would leave somewhat later. Equipment
      would continue to be turned over to the Korean forces. Other than that, the Army
      would remain on duty in South Korea.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What military division was withdrawn from South Korea based on a favorable
          assessment?
        answer: The 2d Infantry Division
      - question: |-
          What was the President's decision regarding combat withdrawals in South Korea in
          July 1979?
        answer: |-
          The President decided to temporarily freeze combat withdrawals, with certain
          supporting units still departing in 1980 and air defense units leaving somewhat
          later. Equipment would continue to be turned over to the Korean forces.
      - question: |-
          Given the new intelligence about North Korea's forces, why did the President
          decide to temporarily freeze combat withdrawals?
        answer: |-
          The President decided to temporarily freeze combat withdrawals because the new
          intelligence indicated that North Korea's forces had much more capability to
          launch an invasion of the Republic of Korea than anyone in Seoul or Washington
          had previously thought.

      The U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) continued to execute a major portion of
      the force development activities in the active Army in fiscal year 1979. During
      the year, FORSCOM activated 55 units, inactivated 31 , deployed 4 to Germany,
      reorganized about 400 units, and redesignated the 24th Infantry Division as a
      mechanized unit. The command executed Phase III of the Aviation Requirements for
      the Combat Structure of the Army Study (ARCSA III), which involved inactivation
      of twelve aviation units, including the three heavy lift companies employing the
      CH-54 Flying Crane rendered obsolete by the improved CH-47D helicopter. In
      implementing the plan for realignment of air defense capabilities in the
      continental United States, FORSCOM inactivated the 31st Air Defense Artillery
      Brigade in Florida, and transferred its three missile battalions (two to Fort
      Bliss, Texas, and one to Fort Bragg, North Carolina). It also inactivated a
      missile battalion and its support elements in Alaska. In an effort to make more
      efficient use of its Transportation Corps troops, FORSCOM inactivated a terminal
      battalion and a boat company at Fort Eustis, Virginia, and used those troops to
      activate thirteen movement control detachments, fourteen cargo documentation
      detachments, and four contract supervision detachments at various locations
      throughout the command.

          Germany.
      - question: |-
          Given the inactivation of certain aviation units due to the obsolescence of the
          CH-54 Flying Crane, what helicopter model is considered an improvement?
        answer: |-
          The CH-47D helicopter is considered an improvement as it led to the inactivation
          of certain aviation units.

      The introduction of new types of weapons and equipment established the need for
      fundamental changes in the future organization and composition of basic combat
      units of the Army. In early 1976, the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command
      (TRADOC) undertook a long-range study to determine the best size, mix, and
      organization of a heavy division (both armored and mechanized). The purpose of
      the study was to develop a plan that would accommodate the demands of the many
      new weapons and equipment systems that would be introduced into the Army's
      division by the mid- 1980's. As the study progressed, it became known as the
      DIVISION 86 project. Its objectives broadened to include not only new systems
      but also tactical and organizational concepts, a framework for force structure
      analysis, and a means to identify required modifications in training. A detailed
      description ofthe heavy division studied and tested since initiation of the
      project appears in the Department of the Army Historical Summary for Fiscal Year
      1978. During 1979, TRADOC conducted three workshops which discussed the progress
      of the DIVISION 86 project and established the need to present the results to
      the Army Commanders Conference in October 1979 and to the Chief of Staff in July
      1980. The workshops discussed the findings and conclusions of a number of
      studies relating to key problems, concepts, and materiel systems of the heavy
      division. Specific topics included tactical maneuvers such as delay and
      disruption of enemy second echelon forces, the airland battle, and the standoff
      target acquisition system. The participants also discussed the basic aspects of
      structural framework: what should be the nature and composition ofthe corps in
      which the division would operate and should the brigade organization be flexible
      (drawing its supporting elements from a division base) or fixed (with most of
      the elements forming an organic part of the brigade).

      - question: |-
          Given the information about the topics discussed in the workshops, such as
          tactical maneuvers and structural framework, can we infer the main concerns of
          the DIVISION 86 project?
        answer: |-
          Yes, the main concerns of the DIVISION 86 project are the introduction of new
          weapons and equipment systems, tactical and organizational concepts, and the
          impact of these changes on the structure and operation of the heavy division.
