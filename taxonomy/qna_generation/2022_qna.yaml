  - context: |-
      In  FY  2022,  the  Army  faced  the  by-then  common  state  of beginning the
      fiscal year without an approved budget. The demand from  combatant  commands
      for  Army  forces  remained  high  even after the United States withdrew from
      Afghanistan in late FY 2021. The service's highest priority remained
      modernization-in materiel, doctrine, talent management, and organization-to
      prepare for largescale combat operations. As part of that modernization, the
      Army, in FY 2022, continued to change policies, processes, and programs to
      improve its ability to build diverse, adaptive, and cohesive teams.

          management, and organization to prepare for largescale combat operations.
      - question: |-
          Given the Army's focus on modernization and the demand for forces, why was the
          Army changing policies, processes, and programs in FY 2022?
        answer: |-
          The Army was changing policies, processes, and programs in FY 2022 to improve
          its ability to build diverse, adaptive, and cohesive teams as part of its
          modernization efforts.
  - context: |-
      The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022 required each military
      department to appoint a special trial counsel. In July 2022, the  Army
      established  the  Office  of  Special  Trial  Counsel.  When it is fully
      operational, it will have exclusive authority to prosecute the  following
      offenses:  murder,  manslaughter,  rape  and  sexual assault of an adult or a
      child, other sexual misconduct, kidnapping, domestic  violence,  stalking,
      retaliation,  child  pornography,  and wrongful broadcast.

          misconduct, and retaliation?
        answer: |-
          The Office of Special Trial Counsel will have exclusive authority to prosecute
          offenses related to murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence,
          stalking, and retaliation.
      - question: |-
          Given the establishment of the Army's Office of Special Trial Counsel and its
          exclusive authority to prosecute certain offenses, why do you think it is
          important to have specialized prosecutors handling these cases?
        answer: |-
          It is important to have specialized prosecutors handling these cases to ensure a
          thorough investigation, fair trial, and appropriate punishment for offenses such
          as murder, manslaughter, sexual assault, and kidnapping, which can be complex
          and sensitive in nature.
  - context: |-
      Initially, the Office of Special Trial Counsel was established as a field
      operating agency of the Office of The Judge Advocate General. This  office  is
      responsible  for  identifying  and  certifying  personnel for assignment to the
      office, which will include 159 personnel in FY 2023 and will grow to 180 by FY
      2025. This will include fifty-three litigation billets for judge advocates
      certified as special trial counsel. No later than 31 August 2023, the Office of
      Special Trial Counsel will  operate  under  the  supervision  of  the  special
      trial  counsel, which will report directly to the secretary of the Army. The
      office is expected to be fully operational by December 2023.

          December 2023.
      - question: |-
          Based on the provided information, why is it necessary for the Office of Special
          Trial Counsel to operate under the supervision of the special trial counsel who
          reports directly to the secretary of the Army?
        answer: |-
          The context does not provide specific reasons for this reporting structure.
          However, it can be inferred that this structure is likely designed to ensure
          direct accountability and oversight of the Office of Special Trial Counsel's
          operations.
  - context: |-
      During the fiscal year, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army
      underwent several organizational changes. In October 2021, the Civilian Senior
      Leader Management Office came under the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary
      of  the  Army  (Manpower and  Reserve  Affairs).  That  same  month,  the  U.S.
      Army  Test  and Evaluation  Office  moved  to  the  Office  of  the  Under
      Secretary  of the Army. Also in October, the Army Science Board became part of
      the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and
      Technology) (ASA [ALT]).

      In April 2022, the Office of Soldiers' Counsel transferred from U.S.  Army
      Medical  Command  (MEDCOM)  to  the  Army  Legal Services  Agency.  The
      organization  provides  legal  assistance  to soldiers in the Army's disability
      evaluation system from the initiation of  the  Medical  Evaluation  Board
      through  final  review  by  the Physical Evaluation Board and separation or
      return to duty. It also assists soldiers who do not concur with their proposed
      Department of Veterans Affairs disability ratings for medical conditions found
      to be unfitting by the Physical Evaluation Board.

        answer: |-
          The Office of Soldiers' Counsel provides legal assistance to soldiers in the
          Army's disability evaluation system, assists soldiers who do not concur with
          their proposed Department of Veterans Affairs disability ratings, and helps
          soldiers with unfitting medical conditions.
      - question: |-
          Based on the information provided, why do you think the transfer of the Office
          of Soldiers' Counsel to the Army Legal Services Agency might have occurred?
        answer: |-
          The text does not provide explicit information on why the transfer occurred.
          However, it could be inferred that the Army Legal Services Agency might have
          better resources or expertise to handle the legal aspects of soldiers'
          disability evaluations and subsequent processes.
  - context: |-
      A November 2021 Army directive changed the military  cochairs and clarified
      responsibilities for program objective memorandum program  evaluation  groups  (
      Table  1 ). In 2018,  Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), had assigned
      commanders of Army major commands as the military cochairs, with management and
      day-to-day  operations  for  each  group  provided  by  an  office of the Army
      Staff. In FY 2022, an Army Staff deputy chief of staff became the military
      cochair for each group. The major command commanders shifted to an advisory role
      for each group. The civilian cochairs, who are assistant secretaries of the
      Army, did not change.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          Who became the military cochair for each program objective memorandum program
          evaluation group in FY 2022?
        answer: An Army Staff deputy chief of staff
      - question: |-
          How did the roles of military and civilian cochairs change in the program
          objective memorandum program evaluation groups from 2018 to 2022?
        answer: |-
          In 2018, commanders of Army major commands were the military cochairs and an
          office of the Army Staff managed and handled the day-to-day operations. In 2022,
          an Army Staff deputy chief of staff became the military cochair, while the major
          command commanders shifted to an advisory role. The civilian cochairs, who are
          assistant secretaries of the Army, did not change their roles.
      - question: |-
          Given the changes in the Army directive of November 2021, why do you think the
          role of the major command commanders shifted from being military cochairs to
          advisors for the program objective memorandum program evaluation groups?
        answer: |-
          The text does not provide specific reasons for this shift. However, one possible
          inference is that the Army Staff deputy chief of staff, with their deeper
          involvement in the Army Staff operations, might be better equipped to manage the
          program evaluation groups. The major command commanders, in their advisory
          roles, could still provide valuable insights and expertise, ensuring a balance
          between operational management and strategic guidance.
  - context: |-

      will  converge  current  digital  initiatives  that  support readiness and
      modernization into a single integrated plan; make them  available  from  small
      units  to  the  entire  enterprise;  and establish standardized delivery
      processes, methods, and tools, all of which will use the cloud as an enabler.
      This objective has six lines of effort. Second, the Army will maintain pace with
      advancements in  relevant  technologies  by  optimizing  its  resources  and
      making data-driven investment decisions that are aligned directly with the
      service's  priorities.  This  objective  has  four  lines  of  effort.  Third,
      transformation requires the Army to change how it recruits, trains, and retains
      those who work with these technologies and to improve its collaboration with
      allies, academia, and industry. This objective has three lines of effort.

          The Office of the Chief Information Officer and the Office of the Deputy Chief
          of Staff, G-6, are working to reduce the number of systems that do not have
          valid authorizations to operate to meet or exceed the 95 percent mandate in FY

      In FY 2022, the Army  continued working on zero-trust cybersecurity, building on
      Network Enterprise Technology Command's test of this concept in FY 2020. This
      zero-trust model eliminates  implicit  trust  in  any  one  element  and
      instead  requires continuous  verification  via  real-time  information  from
      multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. If a device is
      compromised,  the  zero-trust  system  will  contain  the  damage  to a network.
      In January 2022, the Office of Management and Budget issued  a  federal  zero-
      trust  architecture  strategy,  which  required agencies to meet specific
      cybersecurity standards and objectives by the  end  of  FY  2024.  That  same
      month,  HQDA 's  chief  information officer established a zero-trust working
      group for sharing information on lessons learned from testing, demonstrations,
      proofs of concepts, and pilot deployments. The group also recommends appropriate
      use of resources to implement the service's plans for establishing zerotrust
      architecture.

      cloud-based suite of products that merges Microsoft Office applications with
      voice, video, chat, and file-sharing capabilities. The first phase ended in June
      2021 when the service's Microsoft Teams environments moved from the commercial
      virtual remote service to Army 365. The second phase, moving Army email accounts
      from the Defense Enterprise Email system to Army 365, began in July 2021 with an
      expected completion date of 31 March 2022. The third phase, transitioning all
      SharePoint environments to the Army 365 SharePoint online application, began
      late in FY 2021, with completion expected by the end of FY 2022.

        answer: |-
          The three phases of the Army 365 transition are: 1) moving Microsoft Teams
          environments from the commercial virtual remote service to Army 365, which was
          completed in June 2021; 2) moving Army email accounts from the Defense
          Enterprise Email system to Army 365, which began in July 2021 and is expected to
          be completed by 31 March 2022; and 3) transitioning all SharePoint environments
          to the Army 365 SharePoint online application, which began in late FY 2021 and
          is expected to be completed by the end of FY 2022.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the second phase of the Army 365 transition, what
          can be inferred about the potential benefits of this transition for the service?
        answer: |-
          The second phase of the Army 365 transition involves moving Army email accounts
          from the Defense Enterprise Email system to Army 365. This suggests a potential
          benefit of improved email services and possibly better integration with other
          digital tools. However, the specific benefits are not detailed in the passage.
  - context: |-
      The Army did not complete its transition to Army 365 as planned. In FY 2021, the
      service had decided to purchase only 950,000 Army 365 licenses, which were not
      enough to provide access to the system for all soldiers, civilian employees, and
      contractors. By the end of that fiscal year, the Army had not determined how
      personnel not covered by a license could use email and other applications in
      Army 365. In March 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-6, announced
      a  bridging  strategy  that  extended  access  to  the  Defense  Enterprise
      Email system until the end of FY 2022 for personnel without an Army 365
      license.  To  ensure  organizations  would  not  lose  functionality or  data,
      HQDA  extended  the  SharePoint  migration  deadline  into FY 2023.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How many Army 365 licenses were purchased in FY 2021?
        answer: 950,000
      - question: What measures were taken to accommodate personnel without an Army
          365 license?
        answer: |-
          A bridging strategy was announced to extend access to the Defense Enterprise
          Email system until the end of FY 2022, and the SharePoint migration deadline was
          extended into FY 2023.
      - question: |-
          Given the Army's transition to Army 365 and the insufficient number of licenses,
          why might it be necessary to extend the SharePoint migration deadline?
        answer: |-
          Extending the SharePoint migration deadline allows organizations to maintain
          functionality and avoid data loss, as not all personnel have been transitioned
          to Army 365.

      service from a disclaimer to a sustained unmodified  audit  opinion,  the
      secretary  directed  the  assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial
      management  and  comptroller) to establish an audit committee. The committee,
      cochaired by the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the
      Army, is composed of all assistant secretaries and commanding generals from
      major commands. It meets quarterly. The secretary also directed the inclusion of

      Additionally, the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and
      comptroller), in collaboration with  responsible  officials in each  business
      area, developed  a multiyear plan for remediating the major audit issues. The
      assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial  management  and  comptroller)
      reports quarterly on the progress of organizations and individuals to meet their

          What were the main purposes for which the Army used the funds it received from
          the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the two supplemental
          appropriations?
        answer: |-
          The Army used $863 million from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
          Security Act for the Army's operation and maintenance account. The first
          supplemental appropriation was used for expenses incurred by the service in
          deploying units to Europe, amounting to $3.2 billion. The second supplemental
          appropriation was used to replenish weapons and munitions given to Ukraine,
          amounting to $5.2 billion. The Army also reprogrammed more than $2.86 billion
          throughout the year to meet operational demands.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the Army's funding and expenditures, what can be
          inferred about the potential impact of the war in Ukraine on the Army's budget?
        answer: |-
          The war in Ukraine led to additional funding for the Army, with two supplemental
          appropriations totaling $8.4 billion. This suggests a significant impact on the
          Army's budget, likely due to increased operational demands and the need to
          support allied countries.

      agencies  execute  no  more  than  20  percent  of  their  budget in the last
      two months of the fiscal year. During FY 2022, the Army funded  $1.5  billion
      in  operation  and  maintenance  unfinanced requirements by reprioritizing
      requirements, identifying resources for realignment, and accessing DoD-provided
      funding. Among the funded unfinanced requirements were activation of the 11th
      Airborne Division's  headquarters,  U.S.  Army  Pacific's  Operation  Pathways,
      long-haul communications and information technology shortfalls, operations  on
      the  Mexican  border,  and  a  shortfall  in  military pay accounts.

      In the FY 2022-2024 procurement appropriation, the service had obligated 60.8
      percent of the available allotment against the 80 percent goal set by DoD for
      the first year of availability. The Army did not meet this goal because it did
      not receive these appropriations until 11 March 2022, and it concentrated on
      executing the FY 20212023 procurement appropriation. For this appropriation, the
      Army exceeded DoD's standard of 90 percent obligation in the second year of
      availability by 3.3 percent. The Army executed its expiring FY 2020-2022
      procurement appropriation at 99.7 percent. It disbursed 40.2 percent of its FY
      2022 research, development, test, and evaluation appropriation against the 55
      percent goal set by DoD. The service disbursed  80.8  percent  of  its  expiring
      FY  2021  appropriation  in this account.

          disbursed 80.8 percent of its expiring FY 2021 appropriation in this account.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the Army's execution of its procurement and research
          appropriations, why do you think the Army did not meet the 80 percent obligation
          goal in the first year of availability for the FY 2022-2024 procurement
          appropriation?
        answer: |-
          The Army did not meet this goal because it did not receive these appropriations
          until 11 March 2022, and it concentrated on executing the FY 2021-2023

          the awarding of projects in the FY 2022-2026 military construction, Army,
          appropriation?
        answer: |-
          Yes, the potential impact of inflation or environmental, site, or solicitation
          issues can be inferred as the reason for not awarding contracts for twenty-seven
          out of thirty-two projects in the FY 2022-2026 military construction, Army,

      In the FY 2022-2026 military construction, ARNG, appropriation,  the  service
      awarded  contracts  for  two  of  five projects. The three remaining projects
      were not awarded because of  environmental,  site,  or  solicitation  issues,
      or  because  a  priorapproval  reprogramming  was  required.  In  the  FY
      2018-2022 military  construction  appropriation  for  the  ARNG,  all  thirteen
      projects were awarded. In the FY 2022-2026 military construction appropriation

          in their military construction projects?
        answer: |-
          Based on the passage, it can be inferred that the ARNG and USAR might be facing
          challenges related to environmental issues, site issues, solicitation issues, or
          the need for prior-approval reprogramming, which have led to the non-awarding of
          certain projects in the FY 2022-2026 military construction appropriations.

      The  Army  Working  Capital  Fund  consists  of  two  activity groups:  supply
      management  and  industrial  operations.  The  first group  buys  and  manages
      spare  and  repair  parts  for  sale  to  its customers,  primarily  Army
      operating  units.  The  second  group provides the Army an organic industrial
      capability. The fund uses a revolving fund concept, relying on revenue from
      sales to finance operations rather than direct appropriations from Congress. The
      Army did request some direct appropriations for the fund to meet mobilization
      and  wartime  surge  requirements.  At  the  start  of  FY 2022, the fund's cash
      balance of $1.7 billion was within its operating

      - question: |-
          What are the two activity groups of the Army Working Capital Fund and what do
          they do?
        answer: |-
          The two activity groups of the Army Working Capital Fund are supply management
          and industrial operations. The supply management group buys and manages spare
          and repair parts for sale to its customers, primarily Army operating units. The
          industrial operations group provides the Army an organic industrial capability.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the Army Working Capital Fund's two activity groups,
          why does the fund use a revolving fund concept?
        answer: |-
          The Army Working Capital Fund uses a revolving fund concept because it relies on
          revenue from sales to finance operations rather than direct appropriations from
          Congress. This allows the fund to meet mobilization and wartime surge
          requirements without relying on external funding.
