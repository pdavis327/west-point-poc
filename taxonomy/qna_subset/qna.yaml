  - context: |-
      Dispersion of the service's schools and different institutional agendas
      prevented  the  development  of  a  university  structure.  Advances  in digital
      technology  and  distance  learning  now  enable  integrating Training and
      Doctrine Command (TRADOC) schools into a single educational structure modeled
      after successful state university systems, as well as the Air, Marine Corps, and
      National Defense Universities. All elements of officer, warrant officer,
      noncommissioned officer, and civilian education systems, both active and reserve
      components, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps precommissioning program
      will be included. The Army War College will retain its unique status as a
      direct-reporting unit to the chief of staff of the Army. At HQDA, the Office of
      the Deputy Chief of Staff G-3/5/7 will develop relevant policy  and  manage
      resources for the program, which is expected to reach full operational
      capability in June 2017.

      - question: |-
          What is the expected date for the new educational structure to reach full
          operational capability?
        answer: June 2017 was the expected date for the new educational structure to reach full
          operational capability.
      - question: |-
          What components of the officer, warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, and
          civilian education systems will be integrated into the new educational
          structure?
        answer: |-
          All elements of officer, warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, and civilian
          education systems, both active and reserve components, and the Reserve Officers'
          Training Corps precommissioning program will be included
      - question: |-
          Why is the Army War College not being integrated into the new educational structure?
        answer: |-
          The Army War College will retain its unique status as a direct-reporting unit to
          the chief of staff of the Army, possibly due to its specific and distinct role
          in education and training.
  - context: |-
      The TRADOC commanding general will act as Army University chancellor and serve
      as the systemwide integrator, reporting directly to the chief of staff of the
      Army. The commanding general of the Combined Arms Center at Fort  Leavenworth,
      Kansas,  will  act  as executive  vice  chancellor  for  training  and
      education,  providing oversight  of  academic  quality,  support  programs,
      finances,  future development  of  the  system,  and  public  representation
      for  the university. The commandant of the Army War College will act as vice
      chancellor, advising the chancellor and the chief of staff of the Army on
      matters  concerning  strategic  education.  The  Combined  Arms Center's deputy
      commanding general will act as provost, responsible for long-term continuity,
      and will also serve as manager of the Army Learning Coordination Council, which
      will synchronize education activities across the Army.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who is the vice chancellor of Army University?
        answer: The commandant of the Army War College acts as the vice chancellor.
      - question: |-
          Who are the four key figures in the Army University leadership structure and
          what are their roles?
        answer: |-
          The TRADOC commanding general acts as the Army University chancellor and
          systemwide integrator, reporting directly to the chief of staff of the Army. The
          commanding general of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, acts
          as executive vice chancellor for training and education. The commandant of the
          Army War College acts as vice chancellor, advising the chancellor and the chief
          of staff of the Army on matters concerning strategic education. The Combined
          Arms Center's deputy commanding general acts as provost, responsible for long-
          term continuity and managing the Army Learning Coordination Council.
      - question: |-
          Based on the roles of the TRADOC commanding general and the commanding general
          of the Combined Arms Center, how are they related in terms of their
          responsibilities in the Army University?
        answer: |-
          The TRADOC commanding general, as the Army University chancellor, is the overall
          head of the university, while the commanding general of the Combined Arms
          Center, as the executive vice chancellor for training and education, provides
          oversight of academic quality, support programs, finances, future development of
          the system, and public representation for the university. Therefore, the TRADOC
          commanding general is superior to the commanding general of the Combined Arms
          Center in the Army University hierarchy.
  - context: |-
      The  deputy  secretary  of  defense  in  October  2014  directed  a study  into
      the  operational  cost  of  the  Pentagon  Reservation.  One recommendation  of
      the  study  was  that  information  technology (IT)  in  the  Pentagon  be
      consolidated  under  a  Joint  Information Technology Single Service Provider
      (JITSSP), which would be a field service  agency  of  the  Defense  Information
      Systems  Agency.  The resources and capabilities of the new organization would
      be provided by Washington Headquarters Services' Enterprise Information
      Technology  Directorate,  the  Joint  Staff's  IT  operations,  and  the Army's
      Information  Technology  Agency  (ITA),  which  provides  IT services  for  many
      other  DoD  organizations  within  the  National Capital Region. In May 2015,
      the deputy secretary of defense accepted this recommendation and directed its
      implementation in two phases. The  first  phase  of  the  transition  began  in
      July  2015  when  JITSSP assumed operational control of ITA and the Enterprise
      Information Technology  Directorate.  Consolidation  of  common  or  shared  IT
      services within organizations of Office of the Secretary of Defense in the
      Pentagon and the National Capital Region will occur during this phase. The
      second phase will extend the consolidation to the military departments'
      headquarters in the Pentagon and their elements in the National Capital Region.
      The transition is expected to be complete by the end of FY 2016.

      There were two organizational changes in the Office of the ASA (ALT). The Office
      of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Policy, and
      Logistics) became the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army
      (Sustainment),  reflecting  the increased importance of sustainment
      considerations in all phases of the Army's acquisition process. Functional areas
      of responsibility for the office include product support planning and policy,
      sustainment integration  planning  and  oversight,  industrial  base  policy
      and oversight, program protection planning and oversight, and supply chain risk
      management. The Army redesignated the chief systems engineer  as  the  deputy
      assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (data, engineering, and software) to
      emphasize the growing significance of data, engineering, and software throughout
      a program's life cycle.

      In the FY 2022-2026 military construction, Army, appropriation, the service
      awarded contracts for five of thirty-two projects for a total of $110.2 million.
      The twenty-seven remaining projects were not awarded because of the effects of
      inflation or environmental, site, or solicitation issues. They are scheduled to
      be awarded in FY 2023 or FY 2024. Unobligated funding in the amount of $1.7
      billion is available for the remaining FY 2022 projects, adjustments to prior
      year projects, minor construction projects, contingencies, contract adjustments,
      and  for  reprogramming  to  other  RA  construction projects in the event of
      cost growth. In the FY 2018-2022 military construction, Army, appropriation,

      In the FY 2022-2024 procurement appropriation, the service had obligated 60.8
      percent of the available allotment against the 80 percent goal set by DoD for
      the first year of availability. The Army did not meet this goal because it did
      not receive these appropriations until 11 March 2022, and it concentrated on
      executing the FY 20212023 procurement appropriation. For this appropriation, the
      Army exceeded DoD's standard of 90 percent obligation in the second year of
      availability by 3.3 percent. The Army executed its expiring FY 2020-2022
      procurement appropriation at 99.7 percent. It disbursed 40.2 percent of its FY
      2022 research, development, test, and evaluation appropriation against the 55
      percent goal set by DoD. The service disbursed  80.8  percent  of  its  expiring
      FY  2021  appropriation  in this account.

          and evaluation appropriation against the 55 percent goal set by DoD. It also
          disbursed 80.8 percent of its expiring FY 2021 appropriation in this account.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the Army's execution of its procurement and research
          appropriations, why do you think the Army did not meet the 80 percent obligation
          goal in the first year of availability for the FY 2022-2024 procurement
          appropriation?
        answer: |-

          until 11 March 2022, and it concentrated on executing the FY 2021-2023
          procurement appropriation.
  - context: |-
      In January  2022,  the  secretary  of  the Army  published  a memorandum on the
      need for accountability and fiscal stewardship. To focus efforts on moving the
      service from a disclaimer to a sustained unmodified  audit  opinion,  the
      secretary  directed  the  assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial
      management  and  comptroller) to establish an audit committee. The committee,
      cochaired by the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the
      Army, is composed of all assistant secretaries and commanding generals from
      major commands. It meets quarterly. The secretary also directed the inclusion of
      audit metrics into the Command Accountability and Execution Review program.
      Additionally, the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and
      comptroller), in collaboration with  responsible  officials in each  business
      area, developed  a multiyear plan for remediating the major audit issues. The
      assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial  management  and  comptroller)
      reports quarterly on the progress of organizations and individuals to meet their
      milestones in the plan. The Army expects to obtain an audit opinion for the Army
      Working Capital Fund in FY 2026 and for the Army General Fund in FY 2027.
