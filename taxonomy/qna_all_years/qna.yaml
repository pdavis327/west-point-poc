      The North Vietnamese in March 1970 drove Royal Lao forces from the Plain
      of jars in northern Laos and threatened to overrun the Meo heartland. That
      offensive was conducted by regular North Vietnamese units in flagrant violation
      of the Geneva Accords concerning the neutrality of Laos. Following the ouster of
      Prince Sihanouk as Cambodia's head of state, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
      forces moved out of their sanctuaries along the Cambodia Vietnam border to spread
      their control over eastern Cambodia. In conjunction with their thrusts into
      Cambodia, the Communist forces seized two provincial capitals in southern Laos,
      thus securing a water supply route through Laos to compensate for their loss of
      the use of the Cambodian seaports of Kampot and Kampong Som (Sihanoukville). The
      year thus produced the first open confrontation between North Vietnamese and
      Cambodian forces, and for the first time since 1962 the North Vietnamese
      attacked Royal Laotian forces without the facade of the Pathet Lao.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the name of the Cambodian prince who was ousted in March
          1970?
        answer: Prince Sihanouk was the Cambodian prince who was ousted in March 1970.
      - question: |-
          What were the consequences of the North Vietnamese offensive in northern Laos in
          March 1970?
        answer: |-
          The North Vietnamese offensive in northern Laos in March 1970 led to the ouster
          of Royal Lao forces from the Plain of Jars, threatened to overrun the Meo
          heartland, and was a violation of the Geneva Accords concerning the neutrality
          of Laos.
      - question: |-
          Given the North Vietnamese actions in Laos and Cambodia in 1970, what can be
          inferred about their strategic objectives?
        answer: |-
          Based on their actions, the North Vietnamese seemed to be aiming to secure a
          water supply route through Laos to compensate for the loss of Cambodian
          seaports, and to spread their control over eastern Cambodia. They also appeared
          to be increasing their assertiveness, attacking Royal Laotian forces without the
          facade of the Pathet Lao for the first time since 1962.

      In 1979, U.S. Army, Europe, was about 200,000 soldiers strong, or more than a
      quarter the strength of the active Army. With the exception of Brigade 75 (which
      had transferred in late January to northern Germany) and the Berlin Brigade,
      USAREUR was assigned to the Central Army Group. U.S. Army, Europe, contained
      four divisions, four separate brigades, and two armored cavalry regiments. The
      forces were becoming stronger, both armored and mechanized, an expression of
      shock action and firepower directed at Soviet advances. For example, cavalry
      units exchanged their Sheridans for M60's, 210 Cobra/ TOW's in ten companies
      were installed on the ground, and armored units increased the size of their tank
      crews. Artillery forces had been strengthened by the arrival of three battalions
      of medium and heavy artillery (with increases in the number of tubes for every
      battery) and adoption of a novel uploading system to quicken the responses of
      ammunition units alerted for battle. Additional infusions of equipment and
      technology were to follow, and progress was so sure that in 1978 a proposal was
      made to turn over to Germany nearly all the base management operations. The
      proposal, referred to as USAREUR-An Army Deployed, would be negotiated with the
      NATO allies and would better enable the Army to prepare for war.

        answer: 200,000 US Army soldiers were in Europe in 1979.
      - question: What measures were taken to strengthen the U.S. Army, Europe in
          the late 70s?
        answer: |-
          Cavalry units exchanged their Sheridans for M60's, 210 Cobra/ TOW's in ten
          companies were installed on the ground, armored units increased the size of
          their tank crews, three battalions of medium and heavy artillery with increased
          number of tubes for every battery and a novel uploading system to quicken the
          responses of ammunition units alerted for battle were added, and a proposal was
          made to turn over to Germany nearly all the base management operations.
      - question: |-
          Why was the proposal to turn over base
          management operations to Germany beneficial for the U.S. Army, Europe?
        answer: |-
          The proposal to turn over base management operations to Germany
          was beneficial as it would better enable the Army to prepare for
          war by allowing them to focus more on military readiness and less on base
          management operations.

      The U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) continued to execute a major portion of
      the force development activities in the active Army in fiscal year 1979. During
      the year, FORSCOM activated 55 units, inactivated 31 , deployed 4 to Germany,
      reorganized about 400 units, and redesignated the 24th Infantry Division as a
      mechanized unit. The command executed Phase III of the Aviation Requirements for
      the Combat Structure of the Army Study (ARCSA III), which involved inactivation
      of twelve aviation units, including the three heavy lift companies employing the
      CH-54 Flying Crane rendered obsolete by the improved CH-47D helicopter. In
      implementing the plan for realignment of air defense capabilities in the
      continental United States, FORSCOM inactivated the 31st Air Defense Artillery
      Brigade in Florida, and transferred its three missile battalions (two to Fort
      Bliss, Texas, and one to Fort Bragg, North Carolina). It also inactivated a
      missile battalion and its support elements in Alaska. In an effort to make more
      efficient use of its Transportation Corps troops, FORSCOM inactivated a terminal
      battalion and a boat company at Fort Eustis, Virginia, and used those troops to
      activate thirteen movement control detachments, fourteen cargo documentation
      detachments, and four contract supervision detachments at various locations
      throughout the command.

      The introduction of new types of weapons and equipment established the need for
      fundamental changes in the future organization and composition of basic combat
      units of the Army. In early 1976, the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command
      (TRADOC) undertook a long-range study to determine the best size, mix, and
      organization of a heavy division (both armored and mechanized). The purpose of
      the study was to develop a plan that would accommodate the demands of the many
      new weapons and equipment systems that would be introduced into the Army's
      division by the mid- 1980's. As the study progressed, it became known as the
      DIVISION 86 project. Its objectives broadened to include not only new systems
      but also tactical and organizational concepts, a framework for force structure
      analysis, and a means to identify required modifications in training. A detailed
      description ofthe heavy division studied and tested since initiation of the
      project appears in the Department of the Army Historical Summary for Fiscal Year
      1978. During 1979, TRADOC conducted three workshops which discussed the progress
      of the DIVISION 86 project and established the need to present the results to
      the Army Commanders Conference in October 1979 and to the Chief of Staff in July
      1980. The workshops discussed the findings and conclusions of a number of
      studies relating to key problems, concepts, and materiel systems of the heavy
      division. Specific topics included tactical maneuvers such as delay and
      disruption of enemy second echelon forces, the airland battle, and the standoff
      target acquisition system. The participants also discussed the basic aspects of
      structural framework: what should be the nature and composition ofthe corps in
      which the division would operate and should the brigade organization be flexible
      (drawing its supporting elements from a division base) or fixed (with most of
      the elements forming an organic part of the brigade).

        answer: |-
          Yes, the main concerns of the DIVISION 86 project are the introduction of new
          weapons and equipment systems, tactical and organizational concepts, and the
          impact of these changes on the structure and operation of the heavy division.

      Army unit training was influenced during FY 90 and 91 by both budget constraints
      and DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM. The Persian Gulf war reduced unit rotations at
      the National Training Center (NTC) from twelve in FY 90 to five in FY 91. The
      Battle Command Training Program, which trains division and corps staffs by a
      warfighter computer battle simulation exercise, reduced its CONUS program in FY
      91, but provided special training to Army divisions and corps that served in the
      Persian Gulf. REFORGER, an annual joint/combined exercise, was postponed in 1989
      to 1990; while REFORGER 91 relied heavily upon simulations and employed only
      28,000 allied troops. Overseas deployment training (ODT) for the reserve
      components was reduced from 40,000 in FY 90 to 28,000 in FY 91. When DESERT
      SHIELD began in August 1990, Army training and combat developers considered the
      Total Army fundamentally ready for war. Three activated ARNG roundout brigades -
      48th Infantry of Georgia, 155th Armored of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry
      of Louisiana - revealed some deficiencies in combat readiness, but the Army
      leadership considered this normal for reserve component units that train only
      part-time.

        answer: |-
          Budget constraints and DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM influenced Army unit training
          in FY 90 and FY 91. The number of unit rotations at the National Training Center
          reduced from twelve in FY 90 to five in FY 91. Overseas deployment training for
          the reserve components was also reduced from 40,000 in FY 90 to 28,000 in FY 91.

          The three activated ARNG roundout brigades - 48th Infantry of Georgia, 155th
          Armored of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry of Louisiana - were considered to
          have some deficiencies in combat readiness because they train only part-time as

      As the U.S. Army began the last decade of the twentieth century, it faced
      uncertain times and substantial downsizing, even though on two occasions during
      FY 90 and 91 it engaged in major military operations. The first was Operation
      JUST CAUSE, the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 that resulted in the
      ouster of dictator Manuel Noriega and the restoration of a popularly elected
      government. The second was Operation DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, a U.S.-led
      international coalition assembled to turn back Iraq's blatant aggression against
      neighboring Ku wait. On both occasions the U.S. Army rose to the task, employing
      a force made up of the best trained personnel and most modern equipment ever
      assembled. These operations confirmed the trend enunciated in President George
      Bush's August 1990 speech at Aspen, Colorado. He spoke of the need to plan for
      regional conflicts, rather than emphasize a global strategy based on preparation
      for a Soviet attack in Western Europe. Coupled with this change was the need to
      reduce the number and complexity of operational plans by calling on each theater
      to refocus on the increasing threat from regional powers, such as Iraq. Only the
      operational plans in the Pacific theater remained unchanged during FY 90 and 91.

      Meeting extensive commitments with limited resources also demanded the most
      effective personnel possible to accomplish multiple missions  under  a
      comparatively  low  personnel  ceiling. As a result, in FY 2000 the Army
      continued to put considerable effort into recruiting the  best  possible
      personnel,  giving  them  thorough  and  demanding training,  and  retaining
      them  through  incentives.  But  in  the  post-Cold War situation, a strong
      civilian economy competed with the Army for recruits, and operational
      commitments complicated training. The strains of frequent deployment taxed
      soldiers and their families, especially in the face of the opportunities
      presented by a growing civilian labor market demanding workers with the
      technical and managerial skills imparted by Army training. Responding to this
      complex set of problems required the Army to improve the quality of life for its
      personnel, improving aspects of  the  financial,  communal,  and  physical
      environment  strained  by  the long drawdown. Doing so forced the service to use

      - question: |-
          Given the strains of frequent deployment and the growing civilian labor market
          demanding workers with technical and managerial skills imparted by Army
          training, why was it necessary for the Army to improve the quality of life for
          its personnel?

      Their  recognition  that  new  information  systems  were  central  to achieving
      the battlefield goal of information dominance also drove efforts to  address
      future  conventional  war  threats,  which  were  consolidated into the Army's
      digitization initiative. Despite traditionally receiving the smallest
      Department  of  Defense  budget  allocation  (15  percent  in  FY 1999) for
      research, development, test, and evaluation, the Army continued to  develop  new
      sensors,  computing  equipment,  and  communications networks. These tools now
      promised to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled knowledge of
      their tactical and operational situation, which would enable them to employ a
      new generation of precision-guided weapons  in  both  close  combat  and  deep
      attacks  with  disproportionate effect. In FY 2000, Army leaders sought to
      exploit this promise sooner rather than later.

          the benefits for soldiers and commanders?
        answer: |-
          The digitization initiative aimed to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled
          knowledge of their tactical and operational situation, enabling them to employ a
          new generation of precision-guided weapons with disproportionate effect in both

      - question: |-
          Given the Army's efforts to develop new sensors, computing equipment, and
          communications networks for the battlefield, what conclusion can be drawn about
          the Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats?
        answer: |-
          The Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats involves
          leveraging advanced information systems to gain information dominance, which
          would enable the effective use of precision-guided weapons.
  - context: |-
      Since its establishment in 2006, the commander of the Installation Management
      Command  (IMCOM)  had  been  HQDA's  assistant chief  of  staff  for
      installation  management.  The  move  of  IMCOM headquarters from the National
      Capital Region to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, made this arrangement unwieldy by
      2013. An analysis by the Office  of  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for
      Installation  Management resulted in the creation of the IMCOM Task Force and
      the Installation Management  Task  Force  to  identify  the  issues  associated
      with separating the two positions. In December 2014, the chief of staff of the
      Army decided to pursue a separate lieutenant general position for the  IMCOM
      commander. In June 2015, the secretary of the Army approved this separation and
      the new lieutenant general position, with IMCOM becoming a direct-reporting unit
      to the assistant secretary of the Army (installations, energy, and environment).
      The transition to this new arrangement will be completed during FY 2016.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the current position of the IMCOM commander?
        answer: The IMCOM commander is currently a lieutenant general position.
      - question: |-
          What were the sequence of events that led to the creation of the new lieutenant
          general position for the IMCOM commander?
        answer: |-
          First, an analysis was conducted by the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff
          for Installation Management. This led to the creation of the IMCOM Task Force
          and the Installation Management Task Force. Following this, the chief of staff
          of the Army decided to pursue a separate lieutenant general position for the
          IMCOM commander, which was approved by the secretary of the Army. The transition
          to this new arrangement will be completed during FY 2016.
      - question: |-
          Given the information that the IMCOM headquarters was moved to Fort Sam Houston,
          Texas in 2013 and the unwieldiness of the previous arrangement, why was it
          necessary to create a separate lieutenant general position for the IMCOM
          commander?
        answer: |-
          The previous arrangement of the IMCOM commander being the
          HQDA's assistant chief of staff for installation management became unwieldy
          after the move. Therefore, it was necessary to create a separate position to
          manage these responsibilities effectively.

      The  deputy  secretary  of  defense  in  October  2014  directed  a study  into
      the  operational  cost  of  the  Pentagon  Reservation.  One recommendation  of
      the  study  was  that  information  technology (IT)  in  the  Pentagon  be
      consolidated  under  a  Joint  Information Technology Single Service Provider
      (JITSSP), which would be a field service  agency  of  the  Defense  Information
      Systems  Agency.  The resources and capabilities of the new organization would
      be provided by Washington Headquarters Services' Enterprise Information
      Technology  Directorate,  the  Joint  Staff's  IT  operations,  and  the Army's
      Information  Technology  Agency  (ITA),  which  provides  IT services  for  many
      other  DoD  organizations  within  the  National Capital Region. In May 2015,
      the deputy secretary of defense accepted this recommendation and directed its
      implementation in two phases. The  first  phase  of  the  transition  began  in
      July  2015  when  JITSSP assumed operational control of ITA and the Enterprise
      Information Technology  Directorate.  Consolidation  of  common  or  shared  IT
      services within organizations of Office of the Secretary of Defense in the
      Pentagon and the National Capital Region will occur during this phase. The
      second phase will extend the consolidation to the military departments'
      headquarters in the Pentagon and their elements in the National Capital Region.
      The transition is expected to be complete by the end of FY 2016.
