  - context: |-
      Meeting extensive commitments with limited resources also demanded the most
      effective personnel possible to accomplish multiple missions  under  a
      comparatively  low  personnel  ceiling. As a result, in FY 2000 the Army
      continued to put considerable effort into recruiting the  best  possible
      personnel,  giving  them  thorough  and  demanding training,  and  retaining
      them  through  incentives.  But  in  the  post-Cold War situation, a strong
      civilian economy competed with the Army for recruits, and operational
      commitments complicated training. The strains of frequent deployment taxed
      soldiers and their families, especially in the face of the opportunities
      presented by a growing civilian labor market demanding workers with the
      technical and managerial skills imparted by Army training. Responding to this
      complex set of problems required the Army to improve the quality of life for its
      personnel, improving aspects of  the  financial,  communal,  and  physical
      environment  strained  by  the long drawdown. Doing so forced the service to use
      its resources more effectively, not only through the use of technology to
      realize efficiencies in  management,  logistics,  and  training  but  also
      through  new  human resources initiatives and budget reallocations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What was one of the challenges the Army faced in recruiting personnel in FY
          2000?
        answer: A strong civilian economy competing with the Army for recruits was a significant
          challenge the army faced in recruitment in fiscal year 2000.

          The Army focused on improving the financial, communal, and physical environment
          for its personnel
      - question: |-
          Given the strains of frequent deployment and the growing civilian labor market
          demanding workers with technical and managerial skills imparted by Army
          training, why was it necessary for the Army to improve the quality of life for
          its personnel?
        answer: |-
          To retain personnel and attract new recruits in the face of a strong civilian
          economy and the opportunities it presents.

      Their  recognition  that  new  information  systems  were  central  to achieving
      the battlefield goal of information dominance also drove efforts to  address
      future  conventional  war  threats,  which  were  consolidated into the Army's
      digitization initiative. Despite traditionally receiving the smallest
      Department  of  Defense  budget  allocation  (15  percent  in  FY 1999) for
      research, development, test, and evaluation, the Army continued to  develop  new
      sensors,  computing  equipment,  and  communications networks. These tools now
      promised to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled knowledge of
      their tactical and operational situation, which would enable them to employ a
      new generation of precision-guided weapons  in  both  close  combat  and  deep
      attacks  with  disproportionate effect. In FY 2000, Army leaders sought to
      exploit this promise sooner rather than later.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What percentage of the Department of Defense budget did the Army receive for
          research, development, test, and evaluation in FY 1999?
        answer: The Army received 15 percent of the Department of Defense budget
          for research, development, test, and evaluation in FY 1999?
      - question: |-
          What did the Army aim to achieve with its digitization initiative in terms of
          the benefits for soldiers and commanders?
        answer: |-
          The digitization initiative aimed to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled
          knowledge of their tactical and operational situation, enabling them to employ a
          new generation of precision-guided weapons with disproportionate effect in both
          close combat and deep attacks.
      - question: |-
          Given the Army's efforts to develop new sensors, computing equipment, and
          communications networks for the battlefield, what conclusion can be drawn about
          the Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats?
        answer: |-
          The Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats involves
          leveraging advanced information systems to gain information dominance, which
          would enable the effective use of precision-guided weapons.

      Other  council  recommendations  included  some  nonbudgetary  proposals on
      both  military  and  civilian  personnel  initiatives.  For  the  military,  the
      initiatives increased the opportunities for Functional Area 24 (information
      systems engineering) and Functional  Area 53 (automation systems) officers to
      attend the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College; provided a selective
      warrant officer enlistment option for specialized IT/IA skills; copied an Air
      Force initiative to add an IT/IA category in the specialty pay and bonus option
      under Title 37 of the United States Code; expanded the responsibilities of
      brigade signal officers to include automation; and recoded the Functional Area
      53 captain authorization in the brigade S-6 staff to a military occupational
      specialty 251 (data processing technician) warrant officer. For civilians, the
      initiatives encouraged the use of not only flextime and flexplace incentives but
      also an S code for individuals with IA skills/training and specific IT/IA
      training and certification requirements. The council did not endorse creating a
      team to plan and implement an Army Civilian IT Corps, instead requesting that a
      study team determine the feasibility of establishing such a corps.

      While  the  projects  funded  were  essentially  the  same  as  in  FY  1999,
      the basis for the Army research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE)
      funding shifted under the FY 2000 budget. RDTE base support funding (base
      operations, real property services, real property maintenance, environmental
      compliance,  conservation,  and  pollution  prevention)  resources  transferred
      to  the  Operation and Maintenance, Army, appropriation. The major RDTE projects
      in  the  FY  2000  budget  were  the  Comanche  (RAH-66)  armed reconnaissance
      helicopter  and  the  Crusader  howitzer.  In  addition,  missile systems under
      development included BAT Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I),  the
      Multipurpose  Individual  Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the  High-
      Mobility Artillery  Rocket  System  (HIMARS),  the  Line-of-Sight Antitank
      (LOSAT) Missile, the Guided MLRS, the Stinger, and the ATACMS Block II.
      Digitization-related projects were also an important group of items in the RDTE
      budget, including continued integration and development efforts with the Army
      Battle Command System and the Land Warrior Program.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the name of the armed reconnaissance helicopter in the FY
          2000 budget?
        answer: Comanche (RAH-66) was the name of the armed reconnaissance helicopter.
      - question: |-
          What are the major projects funded in the FY 2000 budget under the Army
          research, development, test, and evaluation?
        answer: |-
          The major projects funded in the FY 2000 budget under the Army research,
          development, test, and evaluation are the Comanche (RAH-66) armed reconnaissance
          helicopter, the Crusader howitzer, and various missile systems including BAT
          Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I), the Multipurpose Individual
          Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System
          (HIMARS), the Line-of-Sight Antitank (LOSAT) Missile, the Guided MLRS, the
          Stinger, and the ATACMS Block II.
      - question: |-
          Given the shift in the basis for Army research, development, test, and
          evaluation (RDTE) funding in the FY 2000 budget, why were these changes
          implemented?
        answer: |-
          The changes were implemented to transfer RDTE base support funding (base
          operations, real property services, real property maintenance, environmental
          compliance, conservation, and pollution prevention) resources to the Operation
          and Maintenance, Army, appropriation. This shift likely aimed to streamline
          funding and better support the major RDTE projects in the FY 2000 budget, such
          as the Comanche (RAH-66) armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Crusader
          howitzer, as well as digitization-related projects like the Army Battle Command
          System and the Land Warrior Program.

      Since its establishment in 2006, the commander of the Installation Management
      Command  (IMCOM)  had  been  HQDA's  assistant chief  of  staff  for
      installation  management.  The  move  of  IMCOM headquarters from the National
      Capital Region to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, made this arrangement unwieldy by
      2013. An analysis by the Office  of  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for
      Installation  Management resulted in the creation of the IMCOM Task Force and
      the Installation Management  Task  Force  to  identify  the  issues  associated
      with separating the two positions. In December 2014, the chief of staff of the
      Army decided to pursue a separate lieutenant general position for the  IMCOM
      commander. In June 2015, the secretary of the Army approved this separation and
      the new lieutenant general position, with IMCOM becoming a direct-reporting unit
      to the assistant secretary of the Army (installations, energy, and environment).
      The transition to this new arrangement will be completed during FY 2016.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the current position of the IMCOM commander?
        answer: The IMCOM commander is currently a lieutenant general position.
      - question: |-
          What were the sequence of events that led to the creation of the new lieutenant
          general position for the IMCOM commander?
        answer: |-
          First, an analysis was conducted by the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff
          for Installation Management. This led to the creation of the IMCOM Task Force
          and the Installation Management Task Force. Following this, the chief of staff
          of the Army decided to pursue a separate lieutenant general position for the
          IMCOM commander, which was approved by the secretary of the Army. The transition
          to this new arrangement will be completed during FY 2016.
      - question: |-
          Given the information that the IMCOM headquarters was moved to Fort Sam Houston,
          Texas in 2013 and the unwieldiness of the previous arrangement, why was it
          necessary to create a separate lieutenant general position for the IMCOM
          commander?
        answer: |-
          The previous arrangement of the IMCOM commander being the
          HQDA's assistant chief of staff for installation management became unwieldy
          after the move. Therefore, it was necessary to create a separate position to
          manage these responsibilities effectively.

      The  deputy  secretary  of  defense  in  October  2014  directed  a study  into
      the  operational  cost  of  the  Pentagon  Reservation.  One recommendation  of
      the  study  was  that  information  technology (IT)  in  the  Pentagon  be
      consolidated  under  a  Joint  Information Technology Single Service Provider
      (JITSSP), which would be a field service  agency  of  the  Defense  Information
      Systems  Agency.  The resources and capabilities of the new organization would
      be provided by Washington Headquarters Services' Enterprise Information
      Technology  Directorate,  the  Joint  Staff's  IT  operations,  and  the Army's
      Information  Technology  Agency  (ITA),  which  provides  IT services  for  many
      other  DoD  organizations  within  the  National Capital Region. In May 2015,
      the deputy secretary of defense accepted this recommendation and directed its
      implementation in two phases. The  first  phase  of  the  transition  began  in
      July  2015  when  JITSSP assumed operational control of ITA and the Enterprise
      Information Technology  Directorate.  Consolidation  of  common  or  shared  IT
      services within organizations of Office of the Secretary of Defense in the
      Pentagon and the National Capital Region will occur during this phase. The
      second phase will extend the consolidation to the military departments'
      headquarters in the Pentagon and their elements in the National Capital Region.
      The transition is expected to be complete by the end of FY 2016.

      In FY 2022, the Army continued working on zero-trust cybersecurity, building on
      Network Enterprise Technology Command's test of this concept in FY 2020. This
      zero-trust model eliminates  implicit  trust  in  any  one  element  and
      instead  requires continuous  verification  via  real-time  information  from
      multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. If a device is
      compromised,  the  zero-trust  system  will  contain  the  damage  to a network.
      In January 2022, the Office of Management and Budget issued  a  federal  zero-
      trust  architecture  strategy,  which  required agencies to meet specific
      cybersecurity standards and objectives by the  end  of  FY  2024.  That  same
      month,  HQDA 's  chief  information officer established a zero-trust working
      group for sharing information on lessons learned from testing, demonstrations,
      proofs of concepts, and pilot deployments. The group also recommends appropriate
      use of resources to implement the service's plans for establishing zerotrust
      architecture.

      - question: |-
          Given the Army's continued work on zero-trust cybersecurity and the OMB's
          strategy, what can be inferred about the Army's alignment with the federal
          strategy?
        answer: |-
          The Army is likely aligning its zero-trust cybersecurity efforts with the
          federal strategy, as indicated by the establishment of a zero-trust working
          group to share lessons learned and recommend resource use for implementing the
          service's plans for establishing zero-trust architecture.
  - context: |-
      In January  2022,  the  secretary  of  the Army  published  a memorandum on the
      need for accountability and fiscal stewardship. To focus efforts on moving the
      service from a disclaimer to a sustained unmodified  audit  opinion,  the
      secretary  directed  the  assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial
      management  and  comptroller) to establish an audit committee. The committee,
      cochaired by the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the
      Army, is composed of all assistant secretaries and commanding generals from
      major commands. It meets quarterly. The secretary also directed the inclusion of
      audit metrics into the Command Accountability and Execution Review program.
      Additionally, the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and
      comptroller), in collaboration with  responsible  officials in each  business
      area, developed  a multiyear plan for remediating the major audit issues. The
      assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial  management  and  comptroller)
      reports quarterly on the progress of organizations and individuals to meet their
      milestones in the plan. The Army expects to obtain an audit opinion for the Army
      Working Capital Fund in FY 2026 and for the Army General Fund in FY 2027.

          accountability?
        answer: |-
          The Army is demonstrating a strong commitment to fiscal stewardship and
          accountability by establishing an audit committee, incorporating audit metrics
          into the Command Accountability and Execution Review program, and developing a
          multiyear plan to remediate major audit issues.
