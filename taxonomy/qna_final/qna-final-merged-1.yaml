  - context: |-
      The North Vietnamese in March 1970 drove Royal Lao forces from the Plain
      of jars in northern Laos and threatened to overrun the Meo heartland. That
      offensive was conducted by regular North Vietnamese units in flagrant violation
      of the Geneva Accords concerning the neutrality of Laos. Following the ouster of
      Prince Sihanouk as Cambodia's head of state, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
      forces moved out of their sanctuaries along the Cambodia Vietnam border to spread
      their control over eastern Cambodia. In conjunction with their thrusts into
      Cambodia, the Communist forces seized two provincial capitals in southern Laos,
      thus securing a water supply route through Laos to compensate for their loss of
      the use of the Cambodian seaports of Kampot and Kampong Som (Sihanoukville). The
      year thus produced the first open confrontation between North Vietnamese and
      Cambodian forces, and for the first time since 1962 the North Vietnamese
      attacked Royal Laotian forces without the facade of the Pathet Lao.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the name of the Cambodian prince who was ousted in March
          1970?
        answer: Prince Sihanouk was the Cambodian prince who was ousted in March 1970.
      - question: |-
          What were the consequences of the North Vietnamese offensive in northern Laos in
          March 1970?
        answer: |-
          The North Vietnamese offensive in northern Laos in March 1970 led to the ouster
          of Royal Lao forces from the Plain of Jars, threatened to overrun the Meo
          heartland, and was a violation of the Geneva Accords concerning the neutrality
          of Laos.
      - question: |-
          Given the North Vietnamese actions in Laos and Cambodia in 1970, what can be
          inferred about their strategic objectives?
        answer: |-
          Based on their actions, the North Vietnamese seemed to be aiming to secure a
          water supply route through Laos to compensate for the loss of Cambodian
          seaports, and to spread their control over eastern Cambodia. They also appeared
          to be increasing their assertiveness, attacking Royal Laotian forces without the
          facade of the Pathet Lao for the first time since 1962.
  - context: |-
      The status of major Army units improved generally in personnel and logistics
      during fiscal year 1970, while their training status remained essentially
      unchanged. Support units remained about the same as the previous year; many
      units reported unsatisfactory readiness status. The orderly reduction of Army
      manpower during the first half of the fiscal year, through redeployments from
      Vietnam and subsequent unit inactivations, permitted some improvement in
      readiness of personnel. But toward the end of the year, reduced draft calls,
      failures in meeting draft calls, and changes in planned Vietnam redeployment
      increased the shortage of trained strength and reduced the number of personnel
      available for assignment to units. The result was an erosion of some of the
      gains in personnel readiness made earlier in the year.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the status of Army units' training during fiscal year 1970?
        answer: |-
          The training status of Army units remained essentially unchanged during fiscal
          year 1970.
      - question: |-
          What was the overall status of Army units in terms of personnel, logistics, and
          training during fiscal year 1970?
        answer: |-
          The status of major Army units improved generally in personnel and logistics
          during fiscal year 1970, while their training status remained essentially
          unchanged. However, towards the end of the year, reduced draft calls, failures
          in meeting draft calls, and changes in planned Vietnam redeployment led to an
          erosion of some of the gains in personnel readiness.
      - question: |-
          Why was there an erosion of gains in personnel
          readiness towards the end of fiscal year 1970?
        answer: |-
          The erosion of gains in personnel readiness occurred towards the end of fiscal
          year 1970 due to reduced draft calls, failures in meeting draft calls, and
          changes in planned Vietnam redeployment, which increased the shortage of trained
          strength and reduced the number of personnel available for assignment to units.

      The operations center continued to co-ordinate the Army's contribution to the
      U.S. Secret Service in its role of protecting the President and Vice President
      of the United States. This support included explosive ordinance disposal
      personnel, helicopters, and other assorted equipment and personnel resources. In
      this connection, the Army received an increased number of requests from other
      federal agencies and civil authorities for explosive disposal assistance,
      involving bomb scares, disarming explosive devices, checking and disposing of
      war souvenirs, and providing help in transportation accidents involving
      explosives. Over 4,800 requests were acted upon in fiscal year 1970, compared
      with 3,762 in the previous year.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How many explosive disposal assistance requests were acted upon by the Army in fiscal year 1970?
        answer: Over 4,800 explosive disposal assistance requests were acted upon in fiscal year 1970.
      - question: |-
          What kind of assistance did the Army provide in response to the increased number
          of requests from other federal agencies and civil authorities for explosive disposal assistance?
        answer: |-
          The Army provided explosive ordinance disposal personnel, helicopters, and other
          equipment and personnel resources. This assistance involved dealing with bomb
          scares, disarming explosive devices, checking and disposing of war souvenirs,
          and helping in transportation accidents involving explosives.
      - question: |-
          Based on the increase in requests for explosive disposal assistance, what can be
          inferred about the Army's role and the perceived threat level during this
          period?
        answer: |-
          The Army's role in explosive ordnance disposal became more critical during this
          period, indicating a potential increase in perceived threat level or actual
          incidents involving explosives.
  - context: |-
      The Army's military assistance responsibility includes funding, training,
      logistic support, and production. In fiscal year 1970 the Military Assistance
      Program (MAP) continued the rapid decline that began in 1966. The Department of
      Defense requested $430 million in new funds, and Congress appropriated $350
      million and imposed a similar limit on 1971 new obligational authority. The
      Army's portion of the appropriation was $208 million. The size of the
      appropriation reflects the competing demands between domestic programs and the
      war in Vietnam, along with increasing congressional opposition to military
      assistance and other oversea commitments. Along this line the Army has supported
      the national goal of replacing grant aid with military sales. Meanwhile, the
      1970 Military Assistance Service Funded program remained at the $2.1 billion
      level of the previous year. It was anticipated that the Vietnamization program
      would increase this amount slightly in 1971.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          How much was the Army's portion of the Military Assistance Program appropriation
          for fiscal year 1970?
        answer: The Army's portion of the Military Assistance Program appropriation was $208 million.
      - question: |-
          What can be inferred about the trend of the Military Assistance Program and the
          Army's portion of it in fiscal year 1970, considering the competing demands and
          opposition?
        answer: |-
          The Military Assistance Program, including the Army's portion, continued a rapid
          decline in fiscal year 1970 due to competing demands between domestic programs
          and the war in Vietnam, along with increasing congressional opposition to
          military assistance and other oversea commitments. Despite this, the Army
          supported the goal of replacing grant aid with military sales.
      - question: |-
          Given the Army's support for replacing grant aid with military sales, how might
          this affect the nature of military assistance in the future?
        answer: |-
          The Army's support for replacing grant aid with military sales suggests a
          potential shift towards more self-sustained military assistance, where countries
          would purchase military equipment and services rather than receive them as
          grants. This could potentially lead to a more balanced distribution of financial
          burden and a more market-oriented approach in military assistance.

      In a day of complex, technical, and far-flung communications-electronics systems
      and equipment, efficient and effective operation at all levels requires active
      and sustained management. There were a number of management activities during
      fiscal year 1970 that were more than routine. Communications-electronics
      management in Army installations in the United States, for example, was
      addressed in a major study, and one of the important recommendations, approved
      by the Chief of Staff, was that the installation's communications-electronics
      officer should be at the principal staff level. As a member of the
      installation's principal staff, the C-E officer will be in a position to
      evaluate communications-electronics requirements and provide support
      expeditiously. This management improvement will be reflected not only at
      installation level but in more responsive communications Army-wide.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What was one of the recommendations of the major study on communications-
          electronics management in Army installations in the United States?
        answer: |-
          One of the recommendations was that the installation's communications-
          electronics officer should be at the principal staff level.
      - question: |-
          What changes in communications-electronics management in Army installations in
          the United States were approved by the Chief of Staff?
        answer: |-
          The communications-electronics changes approved by the Chief of Staff included making the installation's
          communications-electronics officer a member of the installation's principal
          staff, which would allow for more efficient evaluation of communications-
          electronics requirements and support provision.
      - question: |-
          Why would making the communications-electronics officer a member of the
          installation's principal staff improve communications-electronics management in
          Army installations in the United States?
        answer: |-
          Making the communications-electronics officer a member of the installation's
          principal staff would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of
          communications-electronics requirements and more expeditious provision of
          support, thereby improving communications-electronics management at the
          installation level and enhancing responsiveness Army-wide.

      In seeking to improve the management of its human and physical resources, the
      Army moved ahead in a number of areas. Adivision restructuring study assessed
      the organization of the Army's heavy combat divisions, and experiments using
      alternative structures containing smaller but more numerous maneuver elements
      began. Based upon ideas contained in a study completed in fiscal year 1978, the
      Army brought about a number of changes to improve the training and education of
      individual officers. In the management of installations, facilities, and
      equipment, energy conservation increased, industrial pollution decreased,
      property accountability improved, and escalating base operating costs were
      checked. Continued reliance on automation and the proliferation of individual
      automated data systems has focused attention on the integration,
      interoperability, survivability, and security of the various systems. In October
      1978, the Office ofthe Assistant Chief of Staff for Automation and
      Communications was established to manage the integration of technologies in
      these rapidly expanding fields.

        answer: |-
          The Army sought to improve its management of human and physical resources
          through division restructuring, changes in the training and education of
          individual officers, better management of installations, facilities, and
          equipment, and focus on the integration, interoperability, survivability, and
          security of automated data systems.
      - question: |-
          Given the focus on energy conservation, decreased industrial pollution, improved
          property accountability, and controlled base operating costs, can we infer that
          the Army's management of installations, facilities, and equipment became more
          efficient?

      In 1979, U.S. Army, Europe, was about 200,000 soldiers strong, or more than a
      quarter the strength of the active Army. With the exception of Brigade 75 (which
      had transferred in late January to northern Germany) and the Berlin Brigade,
      USAREUR was assigned to the Central Army Group. U.S. Army, Europe, contained
      four divisions, four separate brigades, and two armored cavalry regiments. The
      forces were becoming stronger, both armored and mechanized, an expression of
      shock action and firepower directed at Soviet advances. For example, cavalry
      units exchanged their Sheridans for M60's, 210 Cobra/ TOW's in ten companies
      were installed on the ground, and armored units increased the size of their tank
      crews. Artillery forces had been strengthened by the arrival of three battalions
      of medium and heavy artillery (with increases in the number of tubes for every
      battery) and adoption of a novel uploading system to quicken the responses of
      ammunition units alerted for battle. Additional infusions of equipment and
      technology were to follow, and progress was so sure that in 1978 a proposal was
      made to turn over to Germany nearly all the base management operations. The
      proposal, referred to as USAREUR-An Army Deployed, would be negotiated with the
      NATO allies and would better enable the Army to prepare for war.

      - question: |-
          Why was the proposal to turn over base
          management operations to Germany beneficial for the U.S. Army, Europe?
        answer: |-
          The proposal to turn over base management operations to Germany
          was beneficial as it would better enable the Army to prepare for
          war by allowing them to focus more on military readiness and less on base
          management operations.

      In the other global trouble spot where the Army stood on guard, it was a year of
      discovery and surprise. The withdrawal of the 2d Infantry Division from its
      sectors in South Korea, announced by President Carter in 1977, had been based on
      a favorable assessment ofthe peninsular balance. But in 1978, new intelligence
      indicated that the earlier estimate had been overly optimistic, that North
      Korea's forces, the forth largest in the communist world, had much more
      capability to launch an invasion of the Republic of Korea than anyone in Seoul
      or Washington had previously thought. In July 1979 the President decided to
      temporarily freeze combat withdrawals. Certain supporting units would still
      depart in 1980, but air defense units would leave somewhat later. Equipment
      would continue to be turned over to the Korean forces. Other than that, the Army
      would remain on duty in South Korea.

      The U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) continued to execute a major portion of
      the force development activities in the active Army in fiscal year 1979. During
      the year, FORSCOM activated 55 units, inactivated 31 , deployed 4 to Germany,
      reorganized about 400 units, and redesignated the 24th Infantry Division as a
      mechanized unit. The command executed Phase III of the Aviation Requirements for
      the Combat Structure of the Army Study (ARCSA III), which involved inactivation
      of twelve aviation units, including the three heavy lift companies employing the
      CH-54 Flying Crane rendered obsolete by the improved CH-47D helicopter. In
      implementing the plan for realignment of air defense capabilities in the
      continental United States, FORSCOM inactivated the 31st Air Defense Artillery
      Brigade in Florida, and transferred its three missile battalions (two to Fort
      Bliss, Texas, and one to Fort Bragg, North Carolina). It also inactivated a
      missile battalion and its support elements in Alaska. In an effort to make more
      efficient use of its Transportation Corps troops, FORSCOM inactivated a terminal
      battalion and a boat company at Fort Eustis, Virginia, and used those troops to
      activate thirteen movement control detachments, fourteen cargo documentation

      The introduction of new types of weapons and equipment established the need for
      fundamental changes in the future organization and composition of basic combat
      units of the Army. In early 1976, the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command
      (TRADOC) undertook a long-range study to determine the best size, mix, and
      organization of a heavy division (both armored and mechanized). The purpose of
      the study was to develop a plan that would accommodate the demands of the many
      new weapons and equipment systems that would be introduced into the Army's
      division by the mid- 1980's. As the study progressed, it became known as the
      DIVISION 86 project. Its objectives broadened to include not only new systems
      but also tactical and organizational concepts, a framework for force structure
      analysis, and a means to identify required modifications in training. A detailed
      description ofthe heavy division studied and tested since initiation of the
      project appears in the Department of the Army Historical Summary for Fiscal Year
      1978. During 1979, TRADOC conducted three workshops which discussed the progress
      of the DIVISION 86 project and established the need to present the results to
      the Army Commanders Conference in October 1979 and to the Chief of Staff in July
      1980. The workshops discussed the findings and conclusions of a number of
      studies relating to key problems, concepts, and materiel systems of the heavy
      division. Specific topics included tactical maneuvers such as delay and
      disruption of enemy second echelon forces, the airland battle, and the standoff
      target acquisition system. The participants also discussed the basic aspects of
      structural framework: what should be the nature and composition ofthe corps in
      which the division would operate and should the brigade organization be flexible
      (drawing its supporting elements from a division base) or fixed (with most of
      the elements forming an organic part of the brigade).

          Yes, the main concerns of the DIVISION 86 project are the introduction of new
          weapons and equipment systems, tactical and organizational concepts, and the
          impact of these changes on the structure and operation of the heavy division.
  - context: |-
      Fiscal years (FYs) 90 and 91 witnessed dramatic changes in the world order and
      the international security environment. While many nations became more
      politically independent, economic interdependence also increased. New centers of
      political and economic influence were evolving. America's North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO) allies pursued their national interests more assertively,
      while Japan and other nations of the Pacific Rim advanced their positions in the
      world order. U.S. leaders maintained serious concerns about a series of
      international security issues. These issues included the proliferation of
      nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies among many developing nations;
      statesponsored terrorism; insurgency; the subversion of legitimate governments;
      and international drug trafficking. On a brighter note, positive changes
      occurred among many Communist nations during FY 90 and 91. The Soviet Union and
      other members of the Warsaw Pact took giant steps toward renouncing communism
      and adopting free elections and private enterprise.

          saw significant changes in FY 90 and 91.
      - question: |-
          What were the main concerns of U.S. leaders regarding international security
          during FY 90 and 91?
        answer: |-
          The main international security concerns of U.S. leaders in 1990 and 1991 included
          proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies among many
          developing nations; statesponsored terrorism; insurgency; the subversion of
          legitimate governments; and international drug trafficking.
      - question: |-
          Based on the described changes, why might U.S. leaders have been concerned about
          the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies during FY 90
          and 91?
        answer: |-
          The increased political independence of many nations, coupled with the rise of
          new centers of political and economic influence, could have led to unstable
          situations where these technologies could be misused or fall into the wrong
          hands, posing a threat to international security.

      Although funding was limited, quality of life programs continued to receive
      emphasis from both the Army leadership and Congress during FY 90 and 91. Budget
      constraints on new housing resulted in concentration upon maintenance and
      revitalization of existing structures as demonstrated by the Whole Neighborhood
      Revitalization Program. Passed in November 1989, the Military Child Care Act
      provided financial resources to assure minimum funding levels and also
      improvements in the staffs of Army child care facilities. The Army Medical
      Department (AMEDD) tried to increase the quality of medical services for Army
      families while controlling skyrocketing medical costs. Through the Civilian
      Health and Medical Program for Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) Management
      Improvement Program the Army looked to tighten review procedures for CHAMPUS
      services and to control doctors' fees. In October 1990 the Army Surgeon General
      introduced the Gateway to Care Program as an interim measure. The program
      authorized local military hospital commanders to utilize both military and
      civilian provider health care for their patients.

          families.
      - question: |-
          What measures were taken to improve the quality of life programs for the Army in
          FY 90 and 91, despite budget constraints?
        answer: |-
          Funding was limited, but quality of life programs continued to receive emphasis.
          Budget constraints on new housing led to a focus on maintenance and
          revitalization of existing structures. The Military Child Care Act was passed to
          assure minimum funding levels and improvements in the staffs of Army child care
          facilities. The Army Medical Department tried to increase the quality of medical
          services for Army families while controlling medical costs through the CHAMPUS
          Management Improvement Program and the Gateway to Care Program.
      - question: |-
          Given the introduction of the Gateway to Care Program in October 1990, what can
          be inferred about the Army's approach to medical services for its families?
        answer: |-
          The Army was looking to improve its medical services for families by introducing
          the Gateway to Care Program, which allowed local military hospital commanders to
          utilize both military and civilian provider health care for their patients. This
          suggests a more flexible and comprehensive approach to medical care.
  - context: |-
      Army unit training was influenced during FY 90 and 91 by both budget constraints
      and DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM. The Persian Gulf war reduced unit rotations at
      the National Training Center (NTC) from twelve in FY 90 to five in FY 91. The
      Battle Command Training Program, which trains division and corps staffs by a
      warfighter computer battle simulation exercise, reduced its CONUS program in FY
      91, but provided special training to Army divisions and corps that served in the
      Persian Gulf. REFORGER, an annual joint/combined exercise, was postponed in 1989
      to 1990; while REFORGER 91 relied heavily upon simulations and employed only
      28,000 allied troops. Overseas deployment training (ODT) for the reserve
      components was reduced from 40,000 in FY 90 to 28,000 in FY 91. When DESERT
      SHIELD began in August 1990, Army training and combat developers considered the
      Total Army fundamentally ready for war. Three activated ARNG roundout brigades -
      48th Infantry of Georgia, 155th Armored of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry
      of Louisiana - revealed some deficiencies in combat readiness, but the Army
      leadership considered this normal for reserve component units that train only
      part-time.

          What were the changes in the Army unit training during FY 90 and FY 91 in terms
          of budget constraints, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, and the number of unit
          rotations at the National Training Center?
        answer: |-
          Budget constraints and DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM influenced Army unit training
          in FY 90 and FY 91. The number of unit rotations at the National Training Center
          reduced from twelve in FY 90 to five in FY 91. Overseas deployment training for
          the reserve components was also reduced from 40,000 in FY 90 to 28,000 in FY 91.

          Based on the information provided, why were the three activated ARNG roundout
          brigades considered to have some deficiencies in combat readiness?
        answer: |-
          The three activated ARNG roundout brigades - 48th Infantry of Georgia, 155th
          Armored of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry of Louisiana - were considered to
          have some deficiencies in combat readiness because they train only part-time as
          reserve component units.
  - context: |-
      The ability to mobilize, deploy, and sustain its forces effectively for combat
      operations has long been a major concern of the Army. Evidence of this concern
      has been demonstrated by various programs in recent years - CAPSTONE; the Army
      Mobilization and Operations Planning System (AMOPS); various mobilization and
      training exercises, such as OPTIMAL FOCUS and REFORGER; and annual screenings of
      IRRs. The brief duration and operational security needs of JUST CAUSE did not
      favor mobilization of reserve component units, while thorough rehearsing ensured
      almost flawless deployment. Mobilization, deployment, and sustainment for DESERT
      SHIELD/DESERT STORM presented major challenges to the Army leadership for a
      number of reasons. These reasons included no stationing of U.S. troops or
      stockpiling of military materiel in the Middle East, an 8,700-mile supply line
      from CONUS, and the piecemeal activation of reserve component combat service
      support personnel. The demand for strategic lift saw the first activation of the
      Civilian Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) by the president and expensive chartering of
      foreign-flag commercial ships because of deficiencies in the Ready Reserve Force
      (RRF).

          The main reasons were the lack of stationing of U.S. troops or stockpiling of
          military materiel in the Middle East, an 8,700-mile supply line from CONUS, and
          the piecemeal activation of reserve component combat service support personnel.

          Based on the challenges faced during DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, what could have
          been improved in the Army's mobilization, deployment, and sustainment
          strategies?
        answer: |-
          The Army could have improved its strategies by considering the stationing of
          U.S. troops or stockpiling of military materiel in the Middle East, improving
          the readiness of the Ready Reserve Force, and ensuring the availability of
          strategic lift.

      The Army performed a variety of special functions for the civilian sector in
      both the United States and foreign countries during FY 90 and 91. These
      functions included civil works, water projects, the war against drugs,
      improvement and preservation of the environment, and relief for the local
      populace following both natural disasters and the destructive effects of war. As
      part of President Bush's new attack on the illegal drug traffic in FY 89, HQDA
      produced the Army Counter-Narcotics Plan in April 1990. The plan essentially
      reinforced existing Army assistance, which included intelligence, loan of
      equipment, and training of law enforcement personnel in combat and jungle
      operations. In November 1989 the Commander in Chief, U.S. Forces Command (CINC-
      FORSCOM), formed Joint Task Force Six at Fort Bliss, Texas, to coordinate Army
      support to the war against illegal drugs along the Southwest border. By April
      1991 U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) had e l even ant drug training teams in
      five Latin American countries. The ARNG had participated in the drug war for
      thirteen years, and in FY 90 it took a direct part in twenty-five counterdrug
      operations while under state control.

      As the U.S. Army began the last decade of the twentieth century, it faced
      uncertain times and substantial downsizing, even though on two occasions during
      FY 90 and 91 it engaged in major military operations. The first was Operation
      JUST CAUSE, the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 that resulted in the
      ouster of dictator Manuel Noriega and the restoration of a popularly elected
      government. The second was Operation DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, a U.S.-led
      international coalition assembled to turn back Iraq's blatant aggression against
      neighboring Ku wait. On both occasions the U.S. Army rose to the task, employing
      a force made up of the best trained personnel and most modern equipment ever
      assembled. These operations confirmed the trend enunciated in President George
      Bush's August 1990 speech at Aspen, Colorado. He spoke of the need to plan for
      regional conflicts, rather than emphasize a global strategy based on preparation
      for a Soviet attack in Western Europe. Coupled with this change was the need to
      reduce the number and complexity of operational plans by calling on each theater
      to refocus on the increasing threat from regional powers, such as Iraq. Only the
      operational plans in the Pacific theater remained unchanged during FY 90 and 91.

      This conflict between shrinking resources and expanding commitments shaped the
      structure and operation of the U.S. Army as it entered FY 2000. To reconcile the
      contradiction, Army leaders chose to emphasize strategic mobility to meet
      contingencies. Illustrative of this was Operation Desert thunder in February
      1998, when a brigade (-) of the 3d Infantry Division deployed from Fort Stewart,
      Georgia, to Kuwait in less than ninety-six hours in response to Iraqi
      provocation. The Army accomplished this deployment through the use of pre-
      positioned equipment stocks and elaborate logistical networks,  but  the
      leadership  soon  recognized  the  expense,  inflexibility, and vulnerability of
      this approach. These drawbacks would drive much of the Army's research and
      development in FY 2000, as the service sought to obtain both powerful forces
      with reduced logistical impact and supply systems less dependent on masses of
      materiel positioned in forward areas.
