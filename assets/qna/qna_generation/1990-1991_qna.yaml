      Since 1969, the U.S. Army Center of Military History has produced the Department
      of the Army Historical Summary (DAHSUM) as an annual publication. The Center has
      combined fiscal years 1990 and 1991 into a single volume, however, for greater
      continuity and coherence in the coverage of the events surrounding Operation
      DESERT SHIELD/ DESERT STORM, which overlapped those two years. An overview of
      the successes and problems of major Army programs, the DAHSUM seeks to provide a
      record similar to, but more concise than, that published in the annual reports
      of the Secretary of War from 1822 to World War II and in the Army 's portion of
      the Semiannual Report of the Secretary of Defense from 1949 through 1968.

      - question: |-
          What is the purpose of the DAHSUM and what historical documents does it resemble
          in terms of its content and structure?
        answer: |-
          The DAHSUM provides a concise record of major Army programs, similar to the
          annual reports of the Secretary of War from 1822 to World War II and the Army's
          portion of the Semiannual Report of the Secretary of Defense from 1949 through
          1968. Its purpose is to provide a historical summary of the Army's activities.
      - question: |-
          Why did the U.S. Army Center of Military History combine fiscal years 1990 and
          1991 into a single volume of the DAHSUM?
        answer: |-
          The two years were combined to ensure greater continuity and coherence in the
          coverage of the events surrounding Operation DESERT SHIELD/ DESERT STORM, which
          overlapped those two years.

          comprehensive reference guide for various components of the Army, providing
          detailed tables on active and reserve divisions, separate brigades, ranger
          regiments, special forces groups, and budget summaries, among others.
  - context: |-
      Fiscal years (FYs) 90 and 91 witnessed dramatic changes in the world order and
      the international security environment. While many nations became more
      politically independent, economic interdependence also increased. New centers of
      political and economic influence were evolving. America's North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO) allies pursued their national interests more assertively,
      while Japan and other nations of the Pacific Rim advanced their positions in the
      world order. U.S. leaders maintained serious concerns about a series of
      international security issues. These issues included the proliferation of
      nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies among many developing nations;
      statesponsored terrorism; insurgency; the subversion of legitimate governments;
      and international drug trafficking. On a brighter note, positive changes
      occurred among many Communist nations during FY 90 and 91. The Soviet Union and
      other members of the Warsaw Pact took giant steps toward renouncing communism
      and adopting free elections and private enterprise.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          Which two international organizations were mentioned as having significant
          changes in FY 90 and 91?
        answer: North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact
      - question: |-
          What were the main concerns of U.S. leaders regarding international security
          during FY 90 and 91?
        answer: |-
          Proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies among many
          developing nations; statesponsored terrorism; insurgency; the subversion of
          legitimate governments; and international drug trafficking
      - question: |-
          Based on the described changes, why might U.S. leaders have been concerned about
          the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and missile technologies during FY 90
          and 91?
        answer: |-
          The increased political independence of many nations, coupled with the rise of
          new centers of political and economic influence, could have led to unstable
          situations where these technologies could be misused or fall into the wrong
          hands, posing a threat to international security.
  - context: |-
      In the late 1980s Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had reinforced his
      perestroika ("restructuring of the Soviet economy") and glasnost ("openness")
      initiatives with several other strategies. Arms reduction agreements,
      demonstrated by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty of June 1988,
      was one of them. Unilateral reductions in the Soviet armed forces was another.
      In December 1988 Gorbachev announced a Soviet troop withdrawal from central
      Europe. Gorbachev complemented this move with his plan to reduce Soviet armed
      forces by 500,000 men, along with a substantial cut in the number of deployed
      divisions, tanks, and artillery. U.S. national defense policymakers had
      reservations about these events and Gorbachev's advocacy of "reasonable
      sufficiency" for the Soviet defense establishment. They saw Gorbachev's
      proclaimed interest in paring Soviet military posture strongly influenced by an
      ulterior intent to modernize Soviet forces, especially with high-technology
      conventional weapons that the severely weakened Soviet economy could not
      produce.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What was one of the strategies Gorbachev used to reinforce his perestroika and
          glasnost initiatives?
        answer: |-
          Arms reduction agreements, demonstrated by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
          (INF) Treaty of June 1988.
      - question: What were the key military changes Gorbachev announced in the late
          1980s?
        answer: |-
          Gorbachev announced a Soviet troop withdrawal from central Europe, planned to
          reduce Soviet armed forces by 500,000 men, and significantly cut the number of
          deployed divisions, tanks, and artillery.
      - question: |-
          Given Gorbachev's advocacy of 'reasonable sufficiency' for the Soviet defense
          establishment, what might have been his ulterior motive for paring Soviet
          military posture?
        answer: |-
          Gorbachev's proclaimed interest in paring Soviet military posture was likely
          influenced by an ulterior intent to modernize Soviet forces, especially with
          high-technology conventional weapons that the severely weakened Soviet economy
          could not produce.
  - context: |-
      Solidarity movement won the June 1989 elections, which led to the popular
      election of Lech Walesa as prime minister the next year. Reacting to public
      pressure, Czechoslovakia established a cabinet with a non-Communist majority in
      December 1989 and held its first free elections in June 1990. The Hungarian
      Communist Party declared itself noncommunist in October 1989, and parliamentary
      elections in April 1990 yielded a noncommunist conservative majority. Bulgaria's
      Communist Party renounced its role as leader in national politics in December
      1989, which resulted in the installation of a political independent as premier
      in December 1990. A bloody anti-Communist revolution in Romania culminated in
      the execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian president and Communist Party
      chief, and creation of a noncommunist regime. In East Germany the Communist
      government of Erich Honecker was toppled in October 1989, and the opening of the
      Berlin Wall followed on 9 November. East Germany held its first free elections
      on 18 March 1990, and the reunification of Germany occurred on 3 October 1990.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Which country held its first free elections in June 1990?
        answer: Czechoslovakia
      - question: |-
          What significant political changes occurred in Eastern Europe between October
          1989 and October 1990?
        answer: |-
          Communist governments were toppled in several Eastern European countries,
          leading to the establishment of noncommunist regimes, the holding of first free
          elections, and the reunification of Germany.
      - question: |-
          Given the sequence of events, what can be inferred about the impact of the
          Solidarity movement's victory in the 1989 elections on other Eastern European
          countries?
        answer: |-
          The Solidarity movement's victory in the 1989 elections likely emboldened other
          Eastern European countries to challenge their Communist governments, leading to
          a wave of political changes in the region.
  - context: |-
      The progressive dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the programmed withdrawal of
      Soviet troops from central Europe in 1990 accelerated the Treaty on Conventional
      Forces in Europe (CFE) talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.
      Under the auspices of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
      (CSCE), NATO and Warsaw Pact countries signed the CFE Treaty in Paris on 19
      November 1990. Its major provisions allowed each side to retain 20,000 tanks,
      30,000 armored combat vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat aircraft,
      and 2,000 attack helicopters within the area from the Atlantic to the Urals
      (ATTU) . President George Bush declared that the CFE Treaty signaled the end of
      the Cold War. The Vienna Document 1990, an executive agreement reached by CSCE
      members coincident with CFE, established a yearly requirement for NATO and
      Warsaw Pact members to exchange information on personnel

          within the area from the Atlantic to the Urals (ATTU)
  - context: |-
      Because of the declining threat posed by the Communist bloc and the growing
      federal budget deficit, in the summer of 1990 the White House announced a
      willingness to reduce substantially the U.S. defense establishment. Secretary of
      Defense Richard B. Cheney submitted a plan to Congress in June 1990 to cut the
      armed forces 25 percent during the next five years. He specified reductions for
      the Army active component - a drop in personnel strength from 770,000 to 520,000
      and a cut in divisions from 18 to 14 by 1995. President Bush publicized his
      acceptance of a 25 percent reduction in the U.S. armed forces by 1995 during a
      speech to the Aspen Institute Symposium on 2 August 1990. But, the President
      also warned that the Iraqi invasion of Ku wait that very day underscored the
      fact that the world remained a dangerous place. He wanted the cuts to be
      accompanied by a careful and orderly restructuring of America's armed forces.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How many divisions was the Army active component planning to reduce
          to by 1995?

      - question: |-
          What were the main points of the defense establishment plan submitted by
          Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney to Congress in June 1990?
        answer: |-
          The plan involved reducing the U.S. defense establishment substantially, cutting
          the armed forces 25 percent during the next five years, decreasing the Army
          active component's personnel strength from 770,000 to 520,000, and reducing the
          number of divisions from 18 to 14 by 1995.
      - question: |-
          Considering the defense establishment plan and the President's warning about the
          dangerous world, what could be the potential implications of the Iraqi invasion
          of Kuwait for the proposed reduction in the U.S. armed forces?
        answer: |-
          The invasion could lead to a reevaluation of the defense cuts, as the President
          emphasized the need for a careful and orderly restructuring of America's armed
          forces in light of the ongoing dangers in the world.
  - context: |-
      In early FY 90 the Army had an active component strength of 765,000 and 5 corps.
      Its combat units included 28 tactical divisions (18 active and 10 reserve
      components) and 28 separate combat brigades (5 active and 23 reserve
      components). The reserve components included more than half of the soldiers in
      the Total Army, and one-third of the active component divisions had reserve
      component roundout brigades. The FY 91 Defense Authorization Act directed the
      Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct a formal study of the Total Force policy.
      The Pentagon's resultant Total Force Policy Report to the Congress, released at
      the end of 1991, confirmed the continued use of Army National Guard roundout
      brigades, but Army rapid deployment units would have active component support
      units to sustain combat operations for the first thirty days. Active component
      strength reductions continued during FY 90 and 91, but the Army deferred formal
      reserve component reductions pending the response of Congress to the Total Force
      Policy Report.

        answer: 765,000
      - question: |-
          What percentage of the soldiers in the Total Army were in the reserve components
          in early FY 90?
        answer: More than half
      - question: |-
          Based on the information provided, if one-third of the active component
          divisions had reserve component roundout brigades, can it be inferred that the
          reserve components were integral to the Army's operations?
        answer: |-
          Yes, they were integral as they made up more than half of the soldiers in the
          Total Army and were part of one-third of the active component divisions.

      from more than five divisions stationed in CONUS, plus their support units, went
      to the Persian Gulf. U.S. Forces Command (FORSCOM) activated some 145,000
      reserve component personnel who served in CONUS, the Persian Gulf, and Europe,
      while U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), sent more than 87,000 personnel to assist the
      coalition. Operation DESERT STORM began on 17 January 1991 as coalition air
      power systematically destroyed critical Iraqi targets. The coalition ground
      campaign ensued on 24 February, and within a period of 100 hours, coalition
      forces completely routed the Iraqi Army.

      - question: What were the roles of the different U.S. forces during Operation
          DESERT STORM?
        answer: |-
          S. Forces Command (FORSCOM) activated 145,000 reserve component personnel who
          served in CONUS, the Persian Gulf, and Europe. U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR) sent
          more than 87,000 personnel to assist the coalition. The operation began with
          coalition air power destroying critical Iraqi targets, followed by a ground
          campaign that completely routed the Iraqi Army within 100 hours.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about the routing of the Iraqi Army within 100 hours, what
          strategy or tactic might have contributed to this quick victory?
        answer: |-
          The quick victory could be attributed to the systematic destruction of critical
          Iraqi targets by coalition air power before the ground campaign, which
          significantly weakened the Iraqi Army's defense and morale.
  - context: |-
      Combat operations in Panama and the Persian Gulf did not alter the move toward
      substantial Army manpower reductions. The Army Program Objective Memorandum
      (POM) for 1992-97 prescribed reduction of the active component to 580,000 by the
      end of FY 97. Project QUICKSILVER recommended reducing the TOE Army by 160,000
      and the T DA Army by 40,000 military personnel and 57,000 civilian man-years by
      FY 97. Active component strength stood at 765,000 at the beginning of FY 90 and
      fell to 728,000 by year's end because of both voluntary and involuntary
      reduction programs. These programs included a bar to reenlistment for enlisted
      personnel and the Probationary/Conditional Voluntary Indefinite Selection Board
      for officers. HQDA also planned to offer economic incentives to encourage
      voluntary separations. Reduced recruiting goals and higher standards for the
      Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) also were employed to reduce the active
      component. The active component enlisted recruiting objective of 119,901 for FY
      89 was reduced to 87,000 for FY 90. Army standards in FY 90 stipulated that at
      least 95 percent of new accessions have high school diplomas, while 67 percent
      must score in the upper half, and no more than 2 percent in Category IV of the
      AFQT.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What was the active component strength at the beginning of FY 90?
        answer: 765,000
      - question: What measures were taken to reduce the active component strength
          in the Army?
        answer: |-
          Measures taken to reduce the active component strength in the Army included
          voluntary and involuntary reduction programs, economic incentives for voluntary
          separations, reduced recruiting goals, and higher standards for the Armed Forces
          Qualification Test (AFQT).
      - question: |-
          Given the reduction in recruiting goals and the increase in standards for the
          AFQT, what impact might this have had on the demographic of new recruits in the
          Army?
        answer: |-
          The reduction in recruiting goals and the increase in standards for the AFQT
          might have led to a more highly qualified and educated pool of new recruits in
          the Army, but potentially at lower numbers due to the reduced goals.
  - context: |-
      With an objective of 70,668 for FY 90, the ARNG recruited 77,853 or 110.2
      percent of its goal. For FY 90 the Army set an active component recruiting
      objective for women with no prior service (NPS) at 12,600 and achieved a rate of
      100.1 percent. In that year the USAR recruited 8,357 women for an achievement
      rate of 110.4, whereas the ARNG recruited only 4,855 NPs females for a rate of
      69.4 percent. The Army employed 455,776 civilians in FY 90 and, as with military
      personnel, sought a 25 percent reduction of the civilian work force by FY 95.

      Although funding was limited, quality of life programs continued to receive
      emphasis from both the Army leadership and Congress during FY 90 and 91. Budget
      constraints on new housing resulted in concentration upon maintenance and
      revitalization of existing structures as demonstrated by the Whole Neighborhood
      Revitalization Program. Passed in November 1989, the Military Child Care Act
      provided financial resources to assure minimum funding levels and also
      improvements in the staffs of Army child care facilities. The Army Medical
      Department (AMEDD) tried to increase the quality of medical services for Army
      families while controlling skyrocketing medical costs. Through the Civilian
      Health and Medical Program for Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) Management
      Improvement Program the Army looked to tighten review procedures for CHAMPUS
      services and to control doctors' fees. In October 1990 the Army Surgeon General
      introduced the Gateway to Care Program as an interim measure. The program
      authorized local military hospital commanders to utilize both military and
      civilian provider health care for their patients.

      Army training strategy during FY 90 and 91 continued the trend toward more
      simulated and less live training. Initiated in FY 88, the Combined Arms Training
      Strategy (CATS) anticipated that Army training will eventually be based on
      devices rather than supported by them. Reduced funding accelerated the
      development of training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS). The
      Combined Army Tactical Training System (CATT), which performs combined arms
      maneuvers on a simulated battlefield for crews through battalions, was networked
      to eight active component units by the end of 1990. Begun in late 1988,
      distributed training strategy (DTS) was intended to reduce resident training and
      improve instructional quality. DTs will rely heavily upon new technologies -
      computer-based instruction, interactive video disc, and video conferencing. The
      first major DTs pilot project was assigned to the Kentucky Army National Guard
      in 1990.

      Army unit training was influenced during FY 90 and 91 by both budget constraints
      and DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM. The Persian Gulf war reduced unit rotations at
      the National Training Center (NTC) from twelve in FY 90 to five in FY 91. The
      Battle Command Training Program, which trains division and corps staffs by a
      warfighter computer battle simulation exercise, reduced its CONUS program in FY
      91, but provided special training to Army divisions and corps that served in the
      Persian Gulf. REFORGER, an annual joint/combined exercise, was postponed in 1989
      to 1990; while REFORGER 91 relied heavily upon simulations and employed only
      28,000 allied troops. Overseas deployment training (ODT) for the reserve
      components was reduced from 40,000 in FY 90 to 28,000 in FY 91. When DESERT
      SHIELD began in August 1990, Army training and combat developers considered the
      Total Army fundamentally ready for war. Three activated ARNG roundout brigades -
      48th Infantry of Georgia, 155th Armored of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry
      of Louisiana - revealed some deficiencies in combat readiness, but the Army

      Although some weapons systems already in production would continue, Army
      planners decided in FY 91 to focus on modernizing by acquir- ing technically
      advanced new weapons systems rather than upgrading existing ones. For example,
      the revised Armored Systems Modernization (ASM) plan curtailed M1A1 and M1A2
      tank production in preference to the Block III. The ASM sought a heavy chassis
      for the Block III tank that would also be used by the Combat Mobility Vehicle
      (CMV), the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS), and the Infantry Fighting
      Vehicle (IFV). Product development and procurement continued during FY 90 and 91
      for a series of systems that included the Light Helicopter (LHX) Comanche, the
      Forward Area Air Defense System (FAADS), and the High Mobility Multipurpose
      Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). Reserve component modernization proceeded as USAR units
      received HMMWVs and M939 series 5- ton trucks. Pledges of equipment to the ARNG
      by HQDA included M1 or M60A3 thermal sight tanks for its armor units and Apache
      helicopters for twelve of its aviation attack battalions. Responsible for the
      ground-based, surface-to-air air defense of the United States, the Army
      contributed to the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) during FY 90 and 91 by
      ongoing experiments with the free electron laser, with the neutral particle
      beam, and with artificial intelligence. In 1990 the Army Space Council approved

      The ability to mobilize, deploy, and sustain its forces effectively for combat
      operations has long been a major concern of the Army. Evidence of this concern
      has been demonstrated by various programs in recent years - CAPSTONE; the Army
      Mobilization and Operations Planning System (AMOPS); various mobilization and
      training exercises, such as OPTIMAL FOCUS and REFORGER; and annual screenings of
      IRRs. The brief duration and operational security needs of JUST CAUSE did not
      favor mobilization of reserve component units, while thorough rehearsing ensured
      almost flawless deployment. Mobilization, deployment, and sustainment for DESERT
      SHIELD/DESERT STORM presented major challenges to the Army leadership for a
      number of reasons. These reasons included no stationing of U.S. troops or
      stockpiling of military materiel in the Middle East, an 8,700-mile supply line
      from CONUS, and the piecemeal activation of reserve component combat service
      support personnel. The demand for strategic lift saw the first activation of the
      Civilian Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) by the president and expensive chartering of

      The Army performed a variety of special functions for the civilian sector in
      both the United States and foreign countries during FY 90 and 91. These
      functions included civil works, water projects, the war against drugs,
      improvement and preservation of the environment, and relief for the local
      populace following both natural disasters and the destructive effects of war. As
      part of President Bush's new attack on the illegal drug traffic in FY 89, HQDA
      produced the Army Counter-Narcotics Plan in April 1990. The plan essentially
      reinforced existing Army assistance, which included intelligence, loan of
      equipment, and training of law enforcement personnel in combat and jungle
      operations. In November 1989 the Commander in Chief, U.S. Forces Command (CINC-
      FORSCOM), formed Joint Task Force Six at Fort Bliss, Texas, to coordinate Army
      support to the war against illegal drugs along the Southwest border. By April
      1991 U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) had e l even ant drug training teams in

      Growing concerns within the civilian sector about environmental protection and
      preservation affected the Army during FY 90 and 91. In the mid-1980s the Army
      had initiated a twenty-year program to clean up pollution on its properties. The
      FY 90 Defense Authorization Act directed the DOD to prepare a report by early FY
      92 on its long-range environmental goals. One interim measure directed by HQDA
      created the Integrated Training Area Management Program in 1990 that emphasized
      avoiding, as well as repairing, damage to the environment. In FY 91 the Army
      allocated $350 million for environmental cleanup, and an Environmental
      Compliance Achievement Program was created to help commanders comply with
      federal and state environmental laws. Despite these increased efforts, the Army

      military power from CONUS. Other major changes during this period were a planned
      reduction of active component strength from 765,000 troops in FY 90 to 580,000
      by FY 97, and anticipated future budget cuts that would follow the Army's 7
      percent cut in FY 91. Less money also meant difficulty in attracting and
      retaining high-quality personnel, slowed improvement in quality of life
      programs, a continued trend toward more simulated and less live training, and
      highly selective modernization that emphasized acquiring the most technically
      advanced new weapons systems.

      As the U.S. Army began the last decade of the twentieth century, it faced
      uncertain times and substantial downsizing, even though on two occasions during
      FY 90 and 91 it engaged in major military operations. The first was Operation
      JUST CAUSE, the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 that resulted in the
      ouster of dictator Manuel Noriega and the restoration of a popularly elected
      government. The second was Operation DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, a U.S.-led
      international coalition assembled to turn back Iraq's blatant aggression against
      neighboring Ku wait. On both occasions the U.S. Army rose to the task, employing
      a force made up of the best trained personnel and most modern equipment ever
      assembled. These operations confirmed the trend enunciated in President George
      Bush's August 1990 speech at Aspen, Colorado. He spoke of the need to plan for
      regional conflicts, rather than emphasize a global strategy based on preparation
      for a Soviet attack in Western Europe. Coupled with this change was the need to
      reduce the number and complexity of operational plans by calling on each theater
      to refocus on the increasing threat from regional powers, such as Iraq. Only the
      operational plans in the Pacific theater remained unchanged during FY 90 and 91.

        answer: |-
          The text does not provide specific information on why the operational plans in
          the Pacific theater remained unchanged. However, it could be inferred that the
          threat from regional powers in the Pacific may not have been as significant as

      Despite these new challenges, the public mood continued to call for a smaller
      military establishment. The end of the Cold War heralded the beginning of a
      historical process that has traditionally resulted in the drastic downsizing of
      the military force structure, regardless of long-term policies. Rapidly changing
      foreign developments and new fiscal realities within the United States, however,
      have not altered the fact that the world remains a dangerous place. In the words
      of Secretary of the Army Michael P. W. Stone, "Our nation faces a significantly
      more complex and varied security environment than at any time in our history.
      The question we now face is whether our Army is properly structured and equipped
      to meet the emerging strategic requirements of the 1990s and beyond." The Army
      continued to maintain a presence throughout the world, although 1990 and 1991
      saw the United States turn over more defense responsibilities to other nations.

      U.S. response to Iraqi aggression in Kuwait. Beginning 6 August 1990, FORSCOM
      formed a battle staff with 24-hour support to monitor deployment to the Persian
      Gulf. The battle staff remained in place throughout FY 90. According to FORSCOM
      commander General Edwin H. Burba, Jr., FORSCOM provided oversight for most of
      the Army's mobilization and deployment effort. General Burba further said that
      "CONUS Armies were clearly the workhorses of the operation." In excess of
      140,000 active component soldiers from more than 5 divisions, along with their
      affiliated combat support and combat service support units, were sent from CONUS

      United States contributing the major share of troops on the continent. During
      the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s the Soviet Union and its allies in the
      Warsaw Pact began a program of enlargement, reorganization, and vigorous

      In FY 90 the American NATO contingent - USAREUR - consisted of V and VII Corps,
      the Berlin Brigade, and the 3d Brigade of the 2d Armored Division, which was
      situated on the northern edge of the defensive line. Each corps consisted of one
      infantry division, one armored division, and an armored cavalry regiment. In FY
      91, following its deployment to the Persian Gulf and subsequent involvement in
      Operation DESERT STORM, VII Corps returned to Europe, packed up its equipment,
      and redeployed to the United States. Despite the reduction in U.S. Forces in
      NATO, General Crosbie E. Saint, USAREUR commander, regarded continued American
      commitment to Europe as essential: "USAREUR's forward edge became freedom's
      frontier," he wrote in October 1990, "and those who served became the guarantors

      Events concerning the future of conventional forces in Europe were also under
      way beginning in the late 1980s. During 1989 the Bush administration reaffirmed
      the conventional wisdom that the capability of the Warsaw Pact to launch a
      surprise attack remained the greatest threat to peace in Europe. The Warsaw Pact
      felt similarly threatened by NATO. Both NATO and Warsaw Pact policymakers used a
      new negotiating tactic in agreeing to eliminate the Communist bloc's offensive
      advantage by establishing force parity between the rival alliances. In March
      1989 CFE talks began in earnest. Both sides agreed that the Warsaw Pact's
      numerical superiority mandated that force reductions be asymmetrical, a
      concession that the Soviet Union had never made. The CFE talks went forward in
      good faith, but announced voluntary troop withdrawals from Europe by both the

      Despite developments on the arms negotiations front, USAREUR continued to
      maintain peak readiness in FY 90 and 91 and at the same time prepared for the
      drawdown. General Saint managed a delicate balance between readiness and
      drawdown by aiming for what he called "a single capable corps" to maintain the
      forward American presence in Europe. In August 1990 the Bush administration
      announced a 30,000-personnel cut, but Iraq's invasion of Kuwait shifted
      USAREUR's focus from drawdown planning to supporting the coalition in the
      Persian Gulf. USAREUR support for Operation DESERT SHIELD began immediately
      after the President's decision to commit forces. On 14 August 1990, V Corps'
      12th Aviation Brigade was alerted for deployment, and on 28 August it began to
      move. Medical detachments, aviation support, and nuclear, biological, and
      chemical (NBC) teams from both V and VII Corps were among the European Theater
      troops sent to support CENTCOM. In the face of Iraq's continued intransigence,
      USAREUR was ordered on 8 November to provide CENTCOM with a mobile armored corps
