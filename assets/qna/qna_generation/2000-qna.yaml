      This conflict between shrinking resources and expanding commitments shaped the
      structure and operation of the U.S. Army as it entered FY 2000. To reconcile the
      contradiction, Army leaders chose to emphasize strategic mobility to meet
      contingencies. Illustrative of this was Operation Desert thunDer in February
      1998, when a brigade (-) of the 3d Infantry Division deployed from Fort Stewart,
      Georgia, to Kuwait in less than ninety-six hours in response to Iraqi
      provocation. The Army accomplished this deployment through the use of pre-
      positioned equipment stocks and elaborate logistical networks,  but  the
      leadership  soon  recognized  the  expense,  inflexibility, and vulnerability of
      this approach. These drawbacks would drive much of the Army's research and
      development in FY 2000, as the service sought to obtain both powerful forces
      with reduced logistical impact and supply systems less dependent on masses of
      materiel positioned in forward areas.

      - question: |-
          What operation did a brigade of the 3d Infantry Division deploy to in less than
          ninety-six hours in response to Iraqi provocation?
        answer: Operation Desert thunDer in Kuwait
      - question: |-
          What measures did the Army take to accomplish the rapid deployment in Operation
          Desert thunDer?
        answer: The Army used pre-positioned equipment stocks and elaborate logistical
          networks
      - question: |-
          Given the drawbacks of this approach, what was the main focus of the Army's
          research and development in FY 2000?
        answer: |-
          The Army sought to obtain both powerful forces with reduced logistical impact
          and supply systems less dependent on masses of materiel positioned in forward
          areas.
  - context: |-
      Meeting extensive commitments with limited resources also demanded the most
      effective personnel possible to accomplish multiple missions  under  a
      comparatively  low  personnel  ceiling. As  a  result,  in FY 2000 the Army
      continued to put considerable effort into recruiting the  best  possible
      personnel,  giving  them  thorough  and  demanding training,  and  retaining
      them  through  incentives.  But  in  the  post-Cold War situation, a strong
      civilian economy competed with the Army for recruits, and operational
      commitments complicated training. The strains of frequent deployment taxed
      soldiers and their families, especially in the face of the opportunities
      presented by a growing civilian labor market demanding workers with the
      technical and managerial skills imparted by Army training. Responding to this
      complex set of problems required the Army to improve the quality of life for its
      personnel, improving aspects of  the  financial,  communal,  and  physical
      environment  strained  by  the long drawdown. Doing so forced the service to use
      its resources more effectively, not only through the use of technology to
      realize efficiencies in  management,  logistics,  and  training  but  also
      through  new  human resources initiatives and budget reallocations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What was one of the challenges the Army faced in recruiting personnel in FY
          2000?
        answer: A strong civilian economy competing with the Army for recruits
      - question: |-
          What were the main areas the Army focused on to improve the quality of life for
          its personnel?
        answer: |-
          The Army focused on improving the financial, communal, and physical environment
          for its personnel
      - question: |-
          Given the strains of frequent deployment and the growing civilian labor market
          demanding workers with technical and managerial skills imparted by Army
          training, why was it necessary for the Army to improve the quality of life for
          its personnel?
        answer: |-
          To retain personnel and attract new recruits in the face of a strong civilian
          economy and the opportunities it presents.

      Their  recognition  that  new  information  systems  were  central  to achieving
      the battlefield goal of information dominance also drove efforts to  address
      future  conventional  war  threats,  which  were  consolidated into the Army's
      digitization initiative. Despite traditionally receiving the smallest
      Department  of  Defense  budget  allocation  (15  percent  in  FY 1999) for
      research, development, test, and evaluation, the Army continued to  develop  new
      sensors,  computing  equipment,  and  communications networks. These tools now
      promised to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled knowledge of
      their tactical and operational situation, which would enable them to employ a
      new generation of precision-guided weapons  in  both  close  combat  and  deep
      attacks  with  disproportionate effect. In FY 2000, Army leaders sought to
      exploit this promise sooner rather than later.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |-
          What percentage of the Department of Defense budget did the Army receive for
          research, development, test, and evaluation in FY 1999?
        answer: 15 percent
      - question: |-
          What did the Army aim to achieve with its digitization initiative in terms of
          the benefits for soldiers and commanders?
        answer: |-
          The Army aimed to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled
          knowledge of their tactical and operational situation, enabling them to employ a
          new generation of precision-guided weapons with disproportionate effect in both
          close combat and deep attacks.
      - question: |-
          Given the Army's efforts to develop new sensors, computing equipment, and
          communications networks for the battlefield, what conclusion can be drawn about
          the Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats?
        answer: |-
          The Army's strategy for addressing future conventional war threats involves
          leveraging advanced information systems to gain information dominance, which
          would enable the effective use of precision-guided weapons.

      Other  council  recommendations  included  some  nonbudgetary  proposals on
      both  military  and  civilian  personnel  initiatives.  For  the  military,  the
      initiatives increased the opportunities for Functional Area 24 (information
      systems engineering) and Functional  Area 53 (automation systems) officers to
      attend the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College; provided a selective
      warrant officer enlistment option for specialized IT/IA skills; copied an Air
      Force initiative to add an IT/IA category in the specialty pay and bonus option
      under Title 37 of the United States Code; expanded the responsibilities of
      brigade signal officers to include automation; and recoded the Functional Area
      53 captain authorization in the brigade S-6 staff to a military occupational
      specialty 251 (data processing technician) warrant officer. For civilians, the
      initiatives encouraged the use of not only flextime and flexplace incentives but
      also an S code for individuals with IA skills/training and specific IT/IA
      training and certification requirements. The council did not endorse creating a
      team to plan and implement an Army Civilian IT Corps, instead requesting that a
      study team determine the feasibility of establishing such a corps.

          What were the proposed initiatives for both military and civilian personnel in
          terms of IT/IA skills?
        answer: |-
          For the military, the initiatives included providing a selective warrant officer
          enlistment option for specialized IT/IA skills, adding an IT/IA category in the
          specialty pay and bonus option under Title 37 of the United States Code,
          expanding the responsibilities of brigade signal officers to include automation,
          and recoding the Functional Area 53 captain authorization in the brigade S-6
          staff to a military occupational specialty 251 (data processing technician)
          warrant officer. For civilians, the initiatives encouraged the use of not only
          flextime and flexplace incentives but also an S code for individuals with IA
          skills/training and specific IT/IA training and certification requirements.
      - question: |-
          Given the proposed initiatives, would creating a team to plan and implement an
          Army Civilian IT Corps be feasible and beneficial?
        answer: |-
          The council did not endorse creating a team to plan and implement an Army
          Civilian IT Corps, instead requesting that a study team determine the
          feasibility of establishing such a corps.

      While  the  projects  funded  were  essentially  the  same  as  in  FY  1999,
      the basis for the Army research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE)
      funding shifted under the FY 2000 budget. RDTE base support funding (base
      operations, real property services, real property maintenance, environmental
      compliance,  conservation,  and  pollution  prevention)  resources  transferred
      to  the  Operation and Maintenance, Army, appropriation. The major RDTE projects
      in  the  FY  2000  budget  were  the  Comanche  (RAH-66)  armed reconnaissance
      helicopter  and  the  Crusader  howitzer.  In  addition,  missile systems under
      development included BAT Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I),  the
      Multipurpose  Individual  Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the  High-
      Mobility Artillery  Rocket  System  (HIMARS),  the  Line-of-Sight Antitank
      (LOSAT) Missile, the Guided MLRS, the Stinger, and the ATACMS Block II.
      Digitization-related projects were also an important group of items in the RDTE
      budget, including continued integration and development efforts with the Army
      Battle Command System and the Land Warrior Program.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the name of the armed reconnaissance helicopter in the FY
          2000 budget?
        answer: Comanche (RAH-66)
      - question: |-
          What are the major projects funded in the FY 2000 budget under the Army
          research, development, test, and evaluation?
        answer: |-
          The major projects funded in the FY 2000 budget under the Army research,
          development, test, and evaluation are the Comanche (RAH-66) armed reconnaissance
          helicopter, the Crusader howitzer, and various missile systems including BAT
          Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I), the Multipurpose Individual
          Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System
          (HIMARS), the Line-of-Sight Antitank (LOSAT) Missile, the Guided MLRS, the
          Stinger, and the ATACMS Block II.
      - question: |-
          Given the shift in the basis for Army research, development, test, and
          evaluation (RDTE) funding in the FY 2000 budget, why were these changes
          implemented?
        answer: |-
          The changes were implemented to transfer RDTE base support funding (base
          operations, real property services, real property maintenance, environmental
          compliance, conservation, and pollution prevention) resources to the Operation
          and Maintenance, Army, appropriation. This shift likely aimed to streamline
          funding and better support the major RDTE projects in the FY 2000 budget, such
          as the Comanche (RAH-66) armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Crusader
          howitzer, as well as digitization-related projects like the Army Battle Command
          System and the Land Warrior Program.
