## Introduction

Dramatic and significant change does not always emerge sharply  out  of  the  evolutionary processes of  a large  and  complex organization like  the United States Army  in  the  comparatively brief span of  one year, especially during peacetime. But  while this  was  generally true of  fiscal  year 1982,  there was  still  a  re› markable story  in  the  progress the  Army  achieved in  moderniza› tion,  and  therefore readiness, in  the  period from 1 October 1981 to  30  September 1982.

The year's developments took place against a  backdrop of presidential commitment, citizen  consensus, congressional fund› ing, Army  dedication, and the Soviet threat. Throughout the twelve-month period the Army, along with the other armed services,  was engaged in  what  has  been  characterized as the  most comprehensive military modernization since  World  War  II-one unlike  any  that  had  gone  before  considering the  volume,  diversity, and technological complexity involved and its  significance for the  military and  the  nation.

The  tone  of  the  period was set at  all levels  of  authority. Presi› dent  Ronald  Reagan  stressed  the  point  that  "war  comes  not  when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak." Secretary of  Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, calling  attention to "our collective failure to  preserve an  adequate balance of  mili› tary  strength during the  past  decade or  two,"  observed that  our investment in  forces  and  weapons had  declined "while  our  princi› pal  adversaries engaged in  the  greatest buildup of  military  power seen  in  modern times." At  the top of  the Army  organization, Secretary John 0. Marsh, Jr., emphasized that "the threat we now  face  extends across a  full spectrum of  conflict that ranges from  terrorism and  unconventional warfare, through minor  and major conventional war  to,  ultimately, the risk of  theater and strategic  nuclear war."  The Army's  two  principal missions,  Secre› tary Marsh stressed, "are to deter any threat to  our national interests and,  failing  deterrence, to fight  and  win  on  terms  favor› able  to  the United States."

At the  apex  of  the  uniformed sector, the  Chief  of  Staff,  Gen› eral  Edward C.  Meyer,  saw the  problem of  equipment shortages as "serious and  continuing," requiring a  "long-term program of investment in  land  force  materiel." He  saw successful  moderniza-

tion  as  "our only  assurance that, over  time,  we will be  prepared for  the  many  diverse  tasks  we may  be called  upon  to accomplish."

The  obvious  conclusion to this  net  assessment was simply  that continuity is as important as clear  beginnings and  endings in  the annual process of  providing for  the  common defense. National security is  open-ended; research, development, procurement, production-all of  the  elements that  go  into  establishing, equip› ping,  maintaining, and  fielding adequate and  effective military forces-must be  funded at  realistic levels  from year  to  year.

The  Army  did  reasonably well  in  fiscal  year 1982,  given  the realities  of competing demands and  the  ever-present dilemma  of reconciling requirements with  resources. The question of  how much  is enough represents far  more  than  creation of  a wish  list, since it involves  national security  policy,  military  capabilities, ser› vice  roles  and missions, Army  doctrine, and  the  general readi› ness of forces.  "How  much  is enough" starts  with  money.  All else flows  from the  base.

In  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  was allocated $53  billion  of  the $214  billion Department of Defense budget. Total Army re› sources for the  year, comprising monies carried forward from previous years,  direct congressional authorizations, and  various customer accounts, were $82  billion. Obligations for the year were  $68  billion,  while  actual  outlays  were just  above  $44  billion. Such  variations in  the  levels  of  appropriated funds are  the  rule rather than the exception, coming from budget delays, repro› gramming actions, fluctuations in  foreign currencies, and  can› cellations or  delays  in  obligational plans. All  are inevitable ele› ments in  the operation of  one of  the largest businesses in  the world.

The  dimensions of that  business-of running the  Army  while completing, continuing, and  projecting numerous elements of  a modernization program that  was in  full  swing  during the  year› are  suggested by  the funding levels  of  the major budget com› ponents. More  that  $16. 7 billion  was  obligated and  $16.4  billion expended for  personnel purposes in  1982.  Another $4.3  billion was allocated to  research, development, testing, and  evaluation, with  $3.2  billion in  outlays. Procurement accounted for $14. 7 billion  in  obligations and  $8.3  billion  in  expenditures; $1.8  bil› lion  covered construction obligations compared with  $877  mil› lion  in  expenditures. Finally,  operations and  maintenance-the be-all  and end-all in  funding-had $18.8  billion  in  obligational authority and  $15.4  billion  in  outlays.

These funds sustained an  Army strength of  780,391 and  a major organizational structure of  sixteen active and eight re-

serve component divisions. Army civilian strength rested just above  380,000  as the  period ended. In  the  reserve components, paid drill strength in  the Army National Guard was just over 409,000, while  that of  the Army  Reserve was  close  to  243,000. Significant shortages existed in  the Individual Ready Reserve, the  pretrained manpower pool.

Personnel developments during the  year  augered well for  the quality  of  the  Army and  its  ability  to  carry out  its  mission. The percentage of  high school  graduates among first-term enlistees edged above  an  already elevated level  at  the upper end  of  the scale.  Reenlistments soared as  well.  This gratifying progress in both recruiting and reenlistment represented "a  resounding turnabout," as  the Army's personnel chief put it, from condi› tions  in  the  late  1970s,  and  paved the  way for  a shift  from  quan› tity to quality  in  unremitting efforts to improve the  Army's  over› all readiness. Several  factors  entered into  the  favorable equation, among them the military's increased acceptance in American life, the satisfaction of service to  country, the teamwork and pride in  military service, substantial improvements in  military compensation, and,  not  least  of  all,  the  influence of  a depressed economy. Yet,  widespread affirmations of job satisfaction con› firmed that  altruistic and  vocational inducements were  as impor› tant  as  pecuniary considerations in  the  motivational mix.

Leading  into  and  throughout the  present operational period, the  Army  emphasized organizational as well as personnel quality over  quantity. Despite the  need for  more  divisions,  and  plans  to augment the number several years down the line, the Army concentrated on  achieving quality across the board within the existing structure rather than accepting a  lower standard for people, equipment, training, and  readiness within  an  expanded framework. Visible  strides were  made  on  the  personnel side  of the existing force, both in  numbers and standards; but more remained to  be  done in  equipping the  force and  achieving sus› tained improvement on  an  annual basis.

One  significant development of  the report period was  the continuing evaluation, begun  in  May  1981 and  described in  some detail  in  last  year's  report, of  a unit manning system  designed to reduce  the  turbulence inherent in  the  traditional method of  indi› vidual replacement. The first of  twenty company-sized units reached the midpoint of  an  experiment under which soldiers were assigned to and would remain with a  unit throughout training, stateside assignment, and overseas deployment. Al› though obstacles  were  being  identified, the  new  manning experi› ment  promised to  pay  dividends by  reducing personnel turbu› lence  and promoting unit cohesion.

At  a  higher level  in  the development of  the new  manning system  for  the  Army,  substantial progress was made  on  an  Army regimental system.  Under this  concept, the  regiment would  be› come  a  nontactical grouping in  which like  battalions overseas would  be  paired with  like  battalions in  the United States. The regiment would  have  a  home base,  an  honorary colonel  of  the regiment, and  an  adjutant; the  headquarters would  be the  custo› dian  of the  organizational colors  and  traditions. As the  year closed, the initial moves  toward the new  structure were scheduled to take  effect in  a  matter of  days.

Modernizing an army that is  distributed throughout the United States  and  deployed around the  world  was and  is a chal› lenge  of the  first  magnitude in a process  that  involves  not just  the replacement of  several  existing pieces  of  equipment but  an  infu› sion of  583  new  systems  utilizing  advanced technology. This  cur› rent  and  ongoing modernization extended across  the  entire  force structure of  the  Army, involving organization, doctrine, tactics, weapons, equipment, construction, training, and multiyear funding. Above  all,  the  Army had  to  continue to  function effi› ciently and effectively while  it  modernized. New  weapons and equipment were  being  produced, delivered, integrated , operated, maintained, supported, and  sustained, while  displaced materiel was being distributed in combat-ready condition to other elements part  of  the  so-called  high -low mix  that  is an inevitable concomitant of  modernization. As General  Meyer  remarked dur› ing  the  year,  "the  complexity of  the  task  is guaranteed to tax  the imagination, innovation, and  patience of  the  entire Army."

Orchestrating modernization while  maintaining force  readi› ness  was  an  exacting challenge. The process obviously extends from  front  to rear,  side  to side,  top  to bottom. Procurement must be geared  to funding and  production to  industrial capacity;  spare parts packages must be  developed and technical and training publications written or  modified; transportation must  be  sched› uled  and  deliveries and  facilities  adapted to  meet new  require› ments; personnel must be  trained to  operate and  employ new materiel, and  training and  maneuver areas  must  be  modified to fit;  and doctrine and  tactics  must  be  molded to  harmonize with completely new  or  substantially changed procedures, weapons, and  equipment. All of  these  activities proceeded during the  on› going  modernization in  1982.

Some  products of  previous years'  funding and  procurement actions  came  to fruition during the  year.  By the  end  of the  period, three Army battalions-two of them in  Germany-had been equipped with  the  M 1 Abrams tank, production was proceeding

on  the  Bradley fighting vehicle,  the.first production contract had been signed for the AH-64 Apache antiarmor helicopter, and the  first  production unit  of  the  Patriot air  defense missile  system had been received. Fielding continued on the Black Hawk helicopter, the  Stinger manportable air  defense weapon, and  the Firefinder counterbattery and  countermortar radar systems. In the  important area  of  modernizing current and  proven weapons, the  first production aircraft of  the CH-4  7D  medium-lift cargo helicopter program was  delivered well  ahead of  schedule, and work  proceeded on  existing models of  tanks, guns, helicopters, cargo  vehicles,  and  communications equipment destined for  Na› tional  Guard and  Army  Reserve units.

That the  Army  does  not  exist  in  a vacuum, completely walled off  from public  life,  is nowhere more  evident than in  the  realm of  mobilization. The  nation cannot, of  course, wait  for  the  onset of  an emergency to mobilize its manpower and industrial re› sources; plans  must  be  in  place  to  allow  instant response to  con› tingencies of  any  size  and nature. Thus the  Army  was  engaged during the  year  in  reviewing and  rewriting policies  related to  the responsiveness of  the  industrial base;  trying to  obtain legislation for the funding of surges required from industry during an emergency; seeking relief from social  and environmental con› straints on the defense industry; and improving mobilization procedures for ammunition and materiel. Personnel manage› ment  initiatives  were  also  taken  to improve mobilization response.

In  the 1983  budget hearings held in  February 1982  before the  Defense Subcommittee of  the House Appropriations Com› mittee, Secretary Marsh and General Meyer  jointly addressed the  subject  of  deployment of  Army  forces  to  meet  global  commit› ments and  the  capabilities of  the sister services to  provide ade› quate  airlift  and  sealift  to  meet  the  strategic mobility  needs  of the ground forces. "U.S.  strategic mobility forces," they  noted, "are currently unable to  meet NATO  reinforcement objectives or  to project credible U.S.  forces  to  areas  where our  national interests are  threatened. Without additional outsize  airlift and  responsive fast  sealift, our ability to  respond to  global contingencies is  de› pendent upon  the  readiness of our  forward-deployed units,  upon the  prepositioning of  unit  equipment and  war  materiel, and  upon timely  political decisions." The senior officials stressed that, al› though individuals in  the  combat forces were  ready, units were short of  equipment and  war  reserve stocks  were  inadequate for many  contingencies.

In  March 1982,  at the  midpoint of the  fiscal  year,  the  Chief  of Staff,  testifying on  the 1983  budget before the  Defense Subcom-

mittee of  the Senate Appropriations Committee, lamented the widespread practice both  in  and  out  of  the  service  of  viewing  the Army  in  terms of  tanks, trucks, helicopters, and  other weapons and  equipment instead of  looking at  it  from the standpoint of "why we need  an  Army  and  what  kind  of an  Army  we need ." He stressed four basic  characteristics to  support a  rationale for  the kind  of  Army the  nation would  need  in  the  decade ahead. First of  all,  it  would have  to  be  flexible so  that it  could respond to  all types  of  warfare. Second, the  Army  would  require weapons sys› tems  equal  to or  better than  those  of a prospective enemy.  Third, the  Army  must  be  strategically deployable, with  adequate airlift and sealift to support it. And finally, the Army must exhibit sound  tactics  and  doctrines in  order to  be  effective on  the  battle› fields of  today and tomorrow. Only  sustained procurement of adequate quantities of  modern equipment would satisfy these compelling needs. The rest  would be  up  to  the  Army .

All  in  all,  the Army  fared reasonably well  in  the 1982  fiscal year. The interval coincided with events on the international scene-notably in the Middle East, Poland, Afghanistan, and Central America-that prompted the American public to  sup› port  a prudent strengthening of  the  armed forces  after a period of  decline.  Yet  the  countervailing influences of  inflation, expand› ing deficits, and social needs raised the prospect that annual defense budgets would come  under sharp scrutiny in  national debates over  use  of  the  tax  dollar.

How  the  Army  used  its  1982  funds and how  it  carried for› ward  the  myriad activities  of  its national security  role  are  covered in  the  various functional chapters of  this  report.

## Operational Forces

The Army's mission, in  conjunction with  that of  the other armed services,  is to  "preserve the  peace  and  security and  pro› vide  for  the  common defense of  the  United States."  The  Army  is required by statute to  be  "organized, trained, and  equipped pri› marily  for  prompt and  sustained combat  incident to  operations on  land."  In  modern times,  this  injunction represents a tall order, for American commitments are linked to  global interests and agreements which  require the  Army  to be  deployed around the world.

## Organizational  Developments

Against  the  background of a $35  billion  budget, a strength of 780,000, and a  24-division organizational structure, the Army had  substantial numbers of  troops stationed in  Europe and  Ko› rea  during fiscal  year 1982,  as  well  as  smaller elements distri› buted  in various  regions  for  peacekeeping, advisory,  and  logistical purposes. A  four-division force in  Europe was  augmented by three brigades and  regiments. One  division  remained in  Korea, while  Panama and  Alaska  each  had  an  assigned brigade.

As the  fiscal year  opened on  1 October 1981, the  Army  estab› lished  Headquarters and  Headquarters Company of  I  Corps at Fort  Lewis,  Washington. The corps is  composed of  active  and reserve component units. At  a  lower organizational level, the first  Patriot missile  battalion was activated  at  Fort  Bliss, Texas, to train with  this  new  highand  medium-altitude antiaircraft mis› sile system, which  is designed to attack  and  destroy  simultaneously several  enemy  aircraft while  tracking others. Patriot will replace the  Nike  Hercules and  most  Hawk  missiles  presently in use.  Also in  the  air  defense area,  manportable missile systems  were  consoli› dated in  most divisions during the year; Stinger and Redeye teams  are  now  located in  division air  defense battalions rather than  in  maneuver battalions.

Two  major  developments occurred in  the joint service organi› zational  field  during the  year.  One  was the  establishment of  the Rapid  Deployment Joint Task  Force;  the  other  was a reorganiza› tion  of  U.S.  forces  in  the  Caribbean region. Both  developments had  broad Army  connections .

The  Rapid  Deployment Joint Task  Force  grew  out  of  a  1977 study  which recognized the need for a  four-service force that could  be  deployed for  contingencies outside the  regions of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Korea. The President issued  a directive to  establish a force  which  could  pro› ject U.S. power expeditiously; emergencies like the Iranian revolution, the seizure of  American hostages in  Teheran, and the  Soviet  invasion of  Afghanistan stimulated and  justified the formation of  such  a joint task  force.

The  headquarters of the  Rapid  Deployment Joint Task  Force was established on  1 March 1980 as a subordinate element of  the U.S.  Readiness Command. On  1 October 1981  it  was  chartered as  a  separate task  force reporting through the  Joint Chiefs of Staff  to  the  Secretary of  Defense. The headquarters, located at MacDill  Air  Force Base  in  Tampa, Florida, had  the  mission  of planning, training, exercising, and being prepared to  employ designated forces in  response to  contingencies threatening the vital interests of  the  United States.  The  focus  in  the  early  period has been  on  the  Southwest Asia-Persian Gulf  region. The  force  is structured to  deter agression if it should occur.  The  commander has  Army, Navy,  and  Air  Force  elements under his  control-in general, forces  not  otherwise committed to  NATO or  Korea. In 1982 the  force  numbered over  220,000  personnel, about 100,000 of  them Army.

Naval  forces  stationed in  the  Indian Ocean  and  Persian Gulf areas  are  prepared to  go  into  action immediately to  support the joint task  force; the  first  tactical  air  forces  could  be  on  the  scene in the  Southwest  Asia-Persian Gulf  region  within  hours;  a combat› ready  battalion could  be  on  the  ground within  forty-eight hours; the  combat  elements of  an  airborne division  could  be  in  place  in less  than two  weeks;  and an  additional division could arrive in thirty to  thirty-five days.  Near-term pre-positioned ships  are  on station  with  supplies and  equipment to  support Marine  amphibi› ous  forces as  well  as  selected Army and Air Force units, and long-term pre-positioning support will.be  provided as additional ships join  the  maritime fleet.  Meanwhile, the  Air  Force,  through procurement and modifications of  military aircraft and struc› tural changes in the Civil  Reserve Air Fleet, is  expanding its airlift capacity in support of the  joint task force. Through planning, training, and exercises, the overall capability of  the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force improved steadily as  the year  progressed.

In  the  second  joint-service organizational development of fis› cal year  1982,  readjustments and  consolidations were  carried out

in the  Caribbean region to create the  new  U.S.  Forces  Caribbean Command. Established on  1 December 1981,  the  command was formed from the Contingency Joint Task Force at Key  West, Florida; the  Antilles  Defense Command in  Puerto Rico;  a  naval component; and Army, Air  Force, and Marine units. The re› alignment streamlined the command structure and placed re› sponsibility for  the  Caribbean region with  one  commander.

## Readiness

Operational readiness was enhanced along  several  lines within the  year.  One  of  the  more  significant advances  was the  introduc› tion  of  the  new  M 1 Abrams tank  into  six units:  three tank  battal› ions  in  the  3d  Infantry Division  in  Europe and  three in  the 2d Armored Division  in  Texas received the  new  tanks . The Ml is replacing the  M60-series tank  on  a one-for-one basis  throughout the  Army,  with  procurement spread out  over  a  period of  time. Concurrently, the  M60,  an  excellent tank  with  productive service potential, is  being upgraded through improvements that will increase its  survivability and  lethality.

Also  being  modernized are  the  following: the AH-IS Cobra helicopter, with  improvements that  include a laser  range-finder, a  rocket management system, more firepower, and increased survivability; the  UH-60 Black  Hawk  helicopter, with  extended range  and  an  all-weather capability  to  improve troop  and  supply transport and  aeromedical evacuation; and  the  Mll3 armored personnel carrier, with improved suspension and cooling sys› tems  to enhance cross-country mobility  as well as general reliabil› ity  and maintainability .

Although such  modernization had some  detrimental effect on  the  standards by  which  a  unit's readiness was  measured, the problem was a passing  one  related to  the  process  of  change and will be  offset  by  the  enhanced capability derived from  updated equipment and  improved organization.

Substantial improvements in personnel readiness were re› ported during the  year as  a  result of  initiatives to  increase the number of  noncommissioned officers in  the combat arms  and improve the  skill and  efficiency  of  recruits and  careerists. Short › ages  of  noncommissioned officers were  reduced by  half  during 1982,  and reenlistment bonuses and increased promotion op› portunities contributed markedly  to the  retention of  senior  grade personnel, with a resulting benefit in  general readiness . Elimina› tion  procedures were  streamlined, and  enlistment and  reenlist› ment standards were toughened. Among favorable personnel

trends, 86.1  percent of  all  recruits were  high  school  graduates, and  53 percent scored  in the  top  half  of the  Armed Forces  Quali› fication  Test.

As  the  quality  of  the  manpower improved, increased use  of devices  and simulations improved the instructions and led  to more  sustained and  effective  training. Deployment exercises  and the National Training Center provided realistic training that improved individual and  collective  skills.

## Overseas Activities

One  of  the  more significant and  pervasive developments in the  American Army's  major  commitment in  Europe during the year  was  the progress made  by  the theater in  the Armywide modernization program. Besides  the  initial  three-battalion com› plement of  Abrams  Ml  tanks,  U.S.  Army,  Europe (USAREUR), began receiving the new  Bradley fighting vehicle  and Stinger missiles,  moved  well along  on  its conversion of  M60-series  tanks, and  received  AH-1  S Cobra  helicopters and  the  first  UH-60 Black Hawks.  These  gains  substantially advanced  a modernization pro› gram that will  transform U.S.  forces in  Europe over  the  next several  years.  Concurrently during the  year,  major  training areas were  improved and  expanded to  meet  the  changes in  doctrine, organization, and  equipment, and  USAREUR's  ability  to accom› modate  reinforcements from  the  home  base  was improved with the  pre-positioning of  a  fourth division  set  of  equipment.

In  mid-March 1982,  the  Army deployed a  battalion of  the 82d  Airborne Division  from  Fort  Bragg,  North Carolina, to  the Sinai  Peninsula in  the Mediterranean-Red Sea  area  to join the Multinational Force  and  Observers (MFO) established as a result of  the  Egyptian-Israeli Peace  Treaty of  March 1979.  The U.S. contingent, which joined elements from  several  other countries including Italy  and  Colombia, consisted  of a battalion task  force of  800  troops, a  350-member logistical  support element, an  85member  medical  unit  to provide  health  care  for  the  entire  force, and  32 officers  and  enlisted personnel assigned to  the  Multina› tional Force  and  Observers Staff.  The infantry battalion estab› lished and will  continue to  man checkpoints and observation posts  from  Eilat  to Sharm  El Sheikh  and  conduct reconnaissance patrols as  part of  the  effort to  ensure freedom of  navigation in the  Strait  of  Tiran. Battalions of  the  82d  Airborne Division  and the  101  st  Air  Assault  Division  are  to  alternate every  six months in  this  assignment while  the  international commitment remains in  force.

Security problems in  the Western Hemisphere received in› creased attention during fiscal  year 1982.  Factional strife in  El Salvador, tensions between Nicaragua and  Honduras, and  Rus› sian  and  Cuban intervention in  the  region either directly or  by proxy created a  threat that required a  sharpening of  regional priorities and  an  allocation  of  appropriate resources. Helicopters, trucks,  weapons,  and  communications equipment were  dispatched to El Salvador  under the  Foreign Military  Sales program, military teams  were  sent  to  help  the  government develop a national mili› tary  strategy, and  training was provided both  in and  out  of coun› try  to  help the  government deal  with  escalating insurgency.

The  comprehensive modernization going  on  throughout the Army  extended also  to  the  Pacific  region. In  Korea, the  Eighth Army  brought the  program to all aspects  of  the  U.S.-Republic of Korea relationship, including equipment, training, command, control, and  communications. Two  artillery battalions of  the  2d U.S.  Infantry Division converted to  the Ml98 155-mm. towed howitzer, and  one  battalion converted to  the  MI09A2 155-mm. self-propelled howitzer. Receipt  of AH-IS Cobra  helicopters sig› nificantly expanded antitank capability, and  modification of  the Ml 13 armored personnel carrier enhanced tactical  mobility.  Prov› ocations by  the North Koreans heightened the substance and reality  of  the  exercises conducted at  all  levels  of  command dur› ing  the  year.  Interoperability was stressed in these  exercises  since the  defense of  South Korea  is a joint responsibility.

## Command and  Control

Command, control, communications, and  intelligence are  ba› sic  and interdependent properties of  military operations, and their  fusion  provides the  capability  to  transform individual weap› ons  systems  into  an  integrated and  effective force.  Consolidation ideally enables all  levels  of  military force to  "observe, provide warning  and  attack  assessment, process  information, support de› cision  making, communicate, navigate, and  degrade an  enemy's ability  to  perform those functions." The need is  ever-present, the  mission  never-ending.

During the  past  year  work  proceeded on  implementing the Army  Command and  Control Master  Plan  (AC 2 MP),  which  was published in  fifty-eight volumes  in September 1979,  with  several more  volumes  added in  1980  to  bring the  tactical  portion up  to date. Specifically, the 1980  update defined the  architecture for the  Army  Command and  Control System  (ACCS),  set forth  defi› ciencies  to be  overcome, and  established responsibilities and  mile-

stones  for  implementing the  ACCS.  The  update focused  on  base› line  capabilities of  the  tactical  echelons of  the  Army,  which  were projected from  the  current program year  through 1988.

## Intelligence  Activities

Development of  the Army  Intelligence Master Plan  contin› ued  during the  year,  and publication with  distribution down  to division level  was  expected early in 1983.  The plan will  serve many  purposes, such  as  identifying areas  where  intelligence has fallen short and how  the  tactical  performance of  combat units was  affected, listing and setting priorities of  intelligence goals and  objectives, and linking the  Army Intelligence System  with Department of  Defense (DOD)  and national intelligence plan› ning  systems.

Matters brought up  at  the tactical intelligence conference hosted by the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and School (USAICS)  at  Fort Huachuca in  July 1982  indicated that while current intelligence and  electronic warfare doctrine was in  gen› eral use  in  the field, the lack  of  training manuals hampered instruction and dissemination. Manuals being prepared by USAICS  should  help  to  resolve  this  problem. USAICS  had  called the  conference, which  was attended by a broad  sampling  of G-2s and  tactical  military intelligence unit  commanders from  around the  world, to  assist  the school in  promulgating tactical intelli› gence  doctrine.

In  response to the  continuing concern  that  intelligence activi› ties  lacked adequately trained human intelligence (HUMINT) personnel, the  HUMINT Division  of  the  Office  of  the  Assistant Chief  of  Staff  for  Intelligence (OACSI)  participated in  two  ac› tions  to upgrade career programs in this  field.  At the  initiative  of the  Defense Intelligence Agency  (DIA),  the  HUMINT Division coordinated a joint-service advanced debriefing and  interroga› tion  course scheduled to  begin at  Fort Huachuca in  fiscal  year 1983. The  Army  was named  executive  agent  of the  course,  which will  have  instructors from all  three services.  The Office of  the Secretary  of Defense  promised continued funding for  the  course as  part of  the  general intelligence training for  fiscal  year 1984 and beyond. The HUMINT Division also  participated in the HUMINT Training Working  Group  chaired  by DIA.  The  work› ing  group was  set  up to  assess  the adequacy of  DOD's  human intelligence training and  to  make  improvements .

Several initiatives were taken during the year to promote linguistics, responsibility for  which  had  been transferred from

the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Operations and  Plans (ODCSOPS)  to  OACSI  in January 1981.  These plans  included creating a  new  linguist career management field,  establishing a new language  training facility  in  Europe, developing proficiency sustainment training packages  for  units,  setting  up  remote inter› cept locations,  providing  accompanied tours  for  linguists  in Korea, and  using  foreign television tapes  for  unit  training.

A  major event in  the area of  foreign intelligence was  the completion of a draft of the  Soviet  Battlefield Development Plan 2,000 (SBDP  2,000). An  eight-volume work, the SBDP  2,000 projects the  expected Soviet  ground force  threat on  the  battle› field  for  the  next two  decades, including anticipated numbers, types,  and employment options for Soviet  weapons; probable numbers, types,  and  character of  Soviet  units;  and  a  forecast of Soviet  strategy and  tactics . When  published, the  study  will help Army  long-range planners to  develop weapons systems,  force structures, and  battlefield tactics.

Regarding topographic activities, the Army  updated map› ping  needs for  the  continental United States  (CONUS)  and  in the  process  reduced the  number of  requirements, gearing them to priority operational plans  and  major  training areas.  Mapping, charting, and  geodesy  annexes  were  revised  for  the Joint  Strate› gic  Capabilities Plan  (JSCAP)  and  the  Joint Strategic Planning Document (JSPD).  In  other  actions,  the  contractor delivered the Firefinder Digital  Elevation Dubbing Facility  to  Headquarters, FORSCOM,  where it began operations; the Army  evaluation plan  for  the  Defense  Mapping  Agency's  (DMA) prototype digital terrain data base  was  forwarded to DMA;  and the Engineer Topographic Laboratory and  the  Engineer School,  representing DARCOM  and  TRADOC, respectively, began  the  initial  phase of  development for  the  digital  Topographic Support System.

At the  instigation of the  Undersecretary of the  Army,  OACSI initiated a  plan  to  improve the  management of  Army  meteoro› logical  activities.  By  the  close  of  the fiscal  year  a  proposal had been  developed for  an  office  within  Headquarters, TRADOC;  a research, development, test,  and  evaluation (RDTE)  plan;  and  a procurement plan.  The  RDTE  plan  focused  on  tactical  environ› mental  matters, automated surface weather observations on  the battlefield, and  collection  and  interpretation of data  on  the  spot. Analyzed  data  will be compared with  known  weather  sensitivities of individual weapons  to predict  the  effect  of  the  weather on  the weapons. The procurement plan  focused on  improving upper air  sounding equipment for  artillery meteorological sections  and tactical  weather  communications equipment for  the  Air  Weather Service.

The Analysts' Intelligence Display  and  Exploitation System (AIDES)  became fully operational in  fiscal  year 1982.  AIDES enables  intelligence  analysts  to produce current information more accurately as well as time-sensitive indications and  warning data. The  system  provides file  access  and  limited  automated message› handling capability to  principal Army  sites  via  the  Worldwide Military Command and Control System  (WWMCCS)  and  can also  tap  national-level intelligence files  through Intelligence Data Handling Systems  Communication-II. AIDES  is unique  in that  it concurrently supports both  operational and  intelligence  activities.

In  September 1982 the  Undersecretary of the  Army  approved the mission element needs statement (MENS)  for  the  Korean Intelligence Support System  (KISS). The  new system  would  auto› mate  the  Combined Intelligence System-Korea, which  supports the  ground, air, and naval  forces in  Korea .  KISS's  automated support will  provide more volume in handling unassimilated information, an  English-Hangul translation ability, collection management, sensor  correlation, exercise  support, improved an› alyst  working capacity, and  interanalyst communication.

Treating imagery  intelligence as sensitive  compartmented in› formation (SCI)  had long  been a  problem because it  severely restricted dissemination, thereby curtailing its  usefulness. In July 1981 the  director of  the  Central Intelligence Agency,  in consulta› tion  with  the  National Intelligence Board, decided that  imagery intelligence products would  no  longer  be treated as SCI.  In  light of this decision, the intelligence community prepared and published, in June 1982,  a  comprehensive new  National Imag› ery Policy  Manual which significantly increased the authority and  responsibility of  the  military  services  and  the  Defense  Intelli› gence  Agency  for  the  security and use  of  imagery intelligence products. To  promulgate the  new  policy  within  the  Department of  Defense, representatives from the military services  and the Defense Intelligence Agency  met  to  draft Defense Intelligence Agency  Manual  56--1,  which  was  issued  shortly  after fiscal  year 1982  ended. It  supplanted previous Army  imagery policy  con› tained in  the  Army Special  Products Utilization Guide.

During the  past  year  there has  been  increasing concern over the  unauthorized disclosure  of  sensitive  and  state-of-the-art tech› nology  to both  friendly and  unfriendly governments. To  combat this  problem the  Army  has conducted an  indepth study  to deter› mine  which  technologies should be  protected from  release; and it  has  worked with  OSD  and  other military  services  to  eliminate the  release  of  sensitive  technology, to  initiate safeguards against its inadvertent release, and  to  establish an  organization devoted exclusively  to  the  study and  release of  sensitive  technology.

Executive Order 12356, "National Security Information," is› sued  on  2 April 1982, became  effective  on  1 August. Implement› ing  DOD  directives brought defense policies  and  procedures for classifying,  downgrading, declassifying, and  safeguarding infor› mation  that  required protection in  the  interest of  national secu› rity  in  line  with  the  order. The most  significant change was  the establishment of  a new  system  for  classifying,  downgrading, and declassifying documents which  enables a  classifier to  assign an indefinite period of classification if he  or  she  cannot determine a specific  date  or  event  for  declassification. At year's  end  the  Army had  nearly  completed work  on  a revision  of AR 380-5  which  will reflect the  new  policies  and procedures.

Changing requirements for  military  intelligence (Ml)  officers led  to  the  revamping of  the  MI  officer development plan. Dur› ing  the first four to  seven years of  commissioned service, MI officers will ordinarily receive  tactical  assignments. Basic  officer training will,  therefore, stress  schooling in  Army  combat  opera› tions at corps level and below, followed by  initial training in tactical all-source intelligence operations. Upon completion of the  advanced course, MI  officers will specialize in  signal  intelli› gence  (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), imagery  intel› ligence  (!MINT), and  counterintelligence (CI)  or,  on  the  other hand,  foreign areas,  automated data  processing, and  other OPM (Office  of  Personnel Management) specialties.  Additional school› ing  and  training will prepare MI  officers for  at  least  one  tour in another specialty. The final product of  the new  development plan is  a  field grade officer highly qualified to  serve in  both tactical and  specialized  positions,  such  as division  G-2,  MI  (CEWI) battalion commander, field station commander, or HUMINT operations officer. More senior officers would receive assign› ments to Headquarters, Department of the Army,  joint, and DOD intelligence positions.

## Nuclear,  Biological,  and  Chemical Matters

U.S.  policy  supports negotiations aimed  at  obtaining a  com› prehensive agreement banning the production, possession, transfer, and  use  of chemical  weapons. During the  period 19771979, the  United States  and  the  Soviet  Union conducted twelve rounds of  bilateral negotiating sessions  for  the  purpose of  pre› senting a joint proposal to  the  Committee on  Disarmament for negotiation of  a  multilateral chemical arms  control treaty. The bilateral sessions  ended in  1980 because  of  disagreement on  the issues of  verification, declaration of stocks and facilities, and

entry-into-force procedures. During fiscal year  1982 the  Chemi› cal Warfare Working  Group  in the  Committee on  Disarmament continued to define  issues regarding control  of chemical  weapons. This  work  was pursued despite a growing  body  of evidence  that chemical  and  toxic weapons  were  being  used  by Soviet surrogate forces  in  Southeast Asia  and  Afghanistan. Army  chemical  war› fare  experts have  been actively  supporting other U.S.  govern› ment agencies charged with  chemical warfare disarmament objectives.

After  reviewing  what  little progress  was made  in  negotiations, and  considering the  national security implications of  the  use  of chemical  and  biological  weapons in  Southeast Asia  and  Afghan› istan,  President Reagan  decided to  persue modernization of  the deterrent retaliatory stockpile of  chemical weapons . The  Presi› dent  informed Congress  of  his decision  and,  in compliance with the 1976  DOD  Appropriations Authorization Act, provided certification on  8  February 1982  that  the  production of  binary chemical  munitions was "essential  to  the  national interest." The required follow-up report to  Congress on  the U.S.  Chemical Warfare Deterrence Program was given  on  12 March 1982.

To  support the  binary  chemical  modernization program, the President's fiscal year  1983 budget request included $104.3  mil› lion for  tooling  and  initial  production of binary  munitions (Army 155-mm . GB-2  artillery projectiles and  Navy-Air Force  Bigeye VX- 2 bombs);  for  the  construction of a load  and  packout  facility at  Pine  Bluff  Arsenal, Arkansas, for  Bigeye;  and  for  retaliatory research and development. The Bigeye  project at Pine  Bluff Arsenal  is Phase  II  of  the  Integrated Binary  Production Facility. Construction of  the Phase  I  155-mm. GB-2  artillery projectile facility,  which  was approved by Congress  in  1981,  began  in  No› vember  1981. The  contract to  equip  the  facility  was awarded on 9  September 1982.  Plans  for  a  third phase project for future agents  and  delivery  systems (such as Intermediate Volatility Agent (IVA)  warheads for  the  U.S.  multiple launch  rocket  system  and corps  support weapon  system) were  being  considered in the  event these  developmental systems  are  needed.

After long  deliberation and  extensive debate, Congress de› cided  not  to approve funds  for  binary  production and  the  facility this  year.  However, funds  for  research and  development (R&amp;D) were  approved, and $ 7.  9  million  of  the  $18.3  million  requested for  military  construction on  the  Phase  II  Bigeye  facility  was  al› lowed by the Joint  Appropriations Conference Report. This  sum will provide for  area  clean-up and  site  preparation and  for  the development of  a  hazardous waste  landfill, which  is  required

regardless of  the binary issue. Efforts to  seek  approval for a critical  chemical retaliatory capability will  continue. The objec› tive is to develop  and  maintain the  safest,  smallest  chemical  muni› tions  stockpile that  will still deny  a significant military  advantage to  any  instigator of  chemical warfare.

The Army  continued its firm commitment to  achieve the means  to  conduct sustained operations in  a  chemical-biological (CB)  warfare environment through an  expanded CB  defense program of  research, development, test,  and evaluation during fiscal  year 1982.  Overall program funding increased by  56  per› cent  over  the  previous year.

A key element  in improving the  Army's  CB defense  was build› ing  a  sound technological base.  To this  end, funding doubled between fiscal  year 1981  and 1982.  Major  accomplishments in this  area included completion of  threat definition for  mycotox› ins and  evaluation of current CB protective materiel against  T-2 toxins; initiation of  efforts to  develop infrared-ultraviolet CB detection  devices  and  individual chemical  alarms  and  desimeters; investigation  of  the  application of  immunoassay (bioengineering) technology to CB  detection; and continuation of  exploratory development on  a  follow-up technology to  decontaminate eyes and  the  respiratory system  as well as CB  protective clothing. To meet  the  urgent need for  a  standoff chemical detector and  an improved point  chemical  detector, the  Army  accelerated its pro› grams  for  the  XM2 l  Scanning Infrared Remote  Alarm,  Chemi› cal  (SCI-REACH), and the XM22  Automatic Chemical Agent Detector Alarm (ACADA). First units of  both the XM2 l  and XM22  are  now  scheduled for deployment in  fiscal  year 1988 instead of  1992.  In  addition, advanced development continued on  schedule for the XM85  Automatic Liquid Agent Detector (ALAD).

In  fiscal year  1982 the  Army  terminated its XM30-series  mask program. Based  on  the  results of  operational testing, the  XM30 offered no significant operational improvement over  the  current M 17  A 1 protective mask.  Upon termination, the  Army's Train› ing  and  Doctrine Command (TRADOC)  and  Materiel  Develop› ment  and  Readiness  Command (DARCOM)  prepared a follow-up mask  program which  will capitalize on  the  achievements of  the XM30 mask  development (improved fit and  NATO  interchange› able  filter canister) and the proven lens  system  of  the M 17  A 1 mask.

Development of CB collective  protection for  combat  vehicles, vans,  and shelters continued during the year. Modular collec› tive  protection equipment was  integrated with  the  Patriot and

TACFIRE systems. Hybrid collective protection equipment for combat  vehicles  was  applied to  the Fire  Support Team Vehicle, the  Field  Artillery Ammunition Supply  Vehicle,  and  combat  vehi› cles  equipped with  the  Roland missile.

CB decontamination efforts during fiscal  year 1982  focused on  advanced development of  the  Jet Exhaust Decontamination System,  to  provide a  rapid decontamination capability for  com› bat  vehicles, and an  Interior Surface Decontamination System. Advanced  development began  on  a diesel-powered decontamina› tion  apparatus to  replace the  current Ml2Al power-driven one.

Advanced development of the XM76  smoke grenade was completed, and the program entered full-scale engineering development. The  XM76  will provide  armored vehicles  with  more extensive smoke protection in  the middle and far infrared re› gions  of  the  electromagnetic spectrum.

The Army's major commands and reserve components re› ceived  $70  million  to  purchase stock  fund equipment for  chemi› cal defense  under the  OMA  (Operations and  Maintenance, Army) appropriation. The  fiscal  year 1982  OPA  program provided an› other $75  million for major chemical defense items  at  the  unit level, such  as chemical  agent  alarms,  collective  protective shelters, and  NBC  protective masks.

The  battle dress overgarment, a  camouflaged chemical pro› tective (CP)  outer garment that enhances NBC  (nuclear, bio› logical,  chemical) protection, was  adopted for field  use  in June 1982.  This new  overgarment uses  the same  woodland-pattern camouflage overprint as  the new  battle dress uniform fatigues and  provides better CP  protection for  the soldier than the  one presently in  use.

In June 1982 the  U.S. Army  Materiel  Development and  Readi› ness  Command (DARCOM)  replaced five on-scene commanders and  their staffs  as the  agency  designated to  respond to  the  scene of an Army nuclear weapon incident or accident. DARCOM negotiated memoranda of  understanding with  Forces  Command, Training and  Doctrine Command, Communications Command, and  Health Services Command for support. The new  arrange› ment should improve the Army's responsiveness to  a  nuclear weapon incident or  accident.

Major  activities  continued in  the  toxic  chemical demilitariza› tion program, including operations and research efforts at  the Chemical Agency-Munition Disposal System  (CAMDS),  Tooele Army  Depot, Utah; Drill  and Transfer System  (DATS)  opera› tions  at  various storage locations in  the  United States;  and  opera› tions  at  Rocky  Mountain Arsenal, Colorado. The  Army  expanded

its  demilitarization research and development program, which seeks  to identify  innovative technologies to  provide chemical  de› militarization that is  less  expensive and more energy efficient than  current technology.

The  Defense  Resources Board (DRB), along  with  Congress, has  recognized that  demilitarizing toxic  chemical  munitions is a national problem beyond the Army's own  funding resources. The Army's Program Objective Memoranda for fiscal years 1984-1988 provided for  continued operations and  engineering development for chemical demilitarization with  CAMDS  and DA TS  and  for  construction of  a  demilitarization facility  at  Pine Bluff  Arsenal, Arkansas, in  fiscal  year 1984  to  dispose of  the incapacitating  agent  BZ. The DRB programmed additional funds to build  demilitarization facilities  at Johnston Island  and  at three other  U.S.  storage  sites  to demilitarize obsolete  MSS rockets  and M23 land  mines.

Operations and  research efforts at  the  CAMDS  facility  con› tinue to  support the design and construction of  the  Johnston Atoll Chemical  Agent  Disposal  System  QACADS).  This  work  has involved  demilitarizing 7,942  155-mm.  GB projectiles  and  7,766 105-mm.  GB projectiles,  conducting MSS rocket  motor  shearing tests  and GB  incineration experiments, and preparing a  new 4.2-inch  mortar module.

During  fiscal year  1982 DA  TS  safely and  efficiently  demilita› rized  249 containers of  leaking  chemical  munitions at  Pine  Bluff Arsenal,  Arkansas,  and  Anniston Army  Depot,  Alabama.  Opera› tions programmed for fiscal  year 1983  include demilitarizing leaking chemical munitions at Lexington Blue-Grass Depot Activity, Kentucky;  Umatilla  Depot  Activity, Oregon; and  Pueblo Depot  Activity,  Colorado. Chemical demilitarization operations at  Rocky Mountain  Arsenal,  Colorado,  disposed  of  10,196 chemi› cal agent  identification training sets.  The program to dispose  of 5,961  remaining sets will conclude during the  second  quarter of fiscal  year 1982.

In  1981  the  Defense Intelligence Agency  undertook a study to establish  damage-level  goals for  U.S. retaliatory  nuclear  attacks. The  Army  was an  active  participant. The  results  of the  study  will be  one  factor used  in  the  continuing evolution of  U.S.  nuclear policy  and  will help  establish goals  for  reaching specified levels of  damage based  on  certain variables, such  as  the  relative posi› tions  of  U.S. and  enemy forces  at  the  time  of  the  alert  and the response  option  chosen . The  study  will be updated as capabilities, target bases,  and  other factors  change.

During  fiscal year  1982, the  Army  Agent  Orange Task  Forc e (AAOTF)  remained the  primary office  representing the  Depart-

ment  of  Defense (DOD)  in the  nationally publicized controversy over whether or not the use of herbicides, especially Agent Orange, had  a negative  effect  on  the  health  of Vietnam  veterans. The  size  of  the  task  force grew  from three members to  twelve during the  year  in order to fulfill  the  AAOTF's basic  function of providing records and  information to  government agencies  and private  entities  involved in  data  collection, scientific  studies, and litigation requirements generated by  this  matter.

In  November 1981, the  Army  Agent  Orange Task  Force  sub› mitted  testimony before the  Senate  Veterans Affairs Committee on  the  amount of  DOD  assets  committed to  the  Agent Orange effort. Of  particular concern to  the  senators was  adequate and prompt DOD  support to  the  Veterans Administration (VA) Epi› demiology Study mandated by  Public Law  96-151. In other actions, Secretary of  Defense Caspar Weinberger, on  26  April 1982, designated the  Army  as the  lead  DOD  agency  for  support› ing  the  epidemiology study  and  others  relevant  to Agent  Orange. Also,  the DOD  development of  an  exposure index model  was unanimously approved by the  science  panel  of  the  White  House Agent  Orange Working Group. By  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year, the  AAOTF was  ready to  work  on  the  epidemiology study,  but the  Veterans Administration had  not  yet  begun on  it  and Con› gress  was exerting considerable pressure to  have  the  study  done by  the  Centers for  Disease  Control in  Atlanta, Georgia, instead of  by  the  VA.

## Military  Support  to Civilian  Authorities

Fiscal  year 1982 was  another good  year  with  regard to  mili› tary support for disaster relief operations. There were only twenty-five  disasters and  emergencies declared by the  President, and  none  required active  Army  troops. Support rendered by the Army  National Guard to  state  and  local  authorities in  these  inci› dents  is discussed in  Chapter 6.

At  the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, extensive support was  provided during the recovery operation following the  crash of  Air  Florida Flight  90  into  the Potomac  River  just after takeoff from Washington, D.C.'s,  Na› tional  Airport on  13 January 1982.  Army  and  Navy  personnel, under the  command of  the  Director of  Military  Support, Office of the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Operations and  Plans,  recovered the  remains of  seventy-eight victims  and  92  percent of  the  air› craft  wreckage .

When  the  air  traffic  controllers walked  off  the job  in  August 1981, military  controllers stepped in  to  fill the  void  until  the  air

traffic control system  could be  revamped and new  controllers trained.

Support to  the U.S.  Secret Service during fiscal  year 1982 consisted primarily of  bomb  search  assistance  in connection with the  travel  of  officials  who  were  authorized Secret  Service  protec› tion.  Army  personnel carried out  over  900  such  missions  in  the continental United States and overseas during the year. Addi› tional support to  the Secret Service was  chiefly in  the area of transportation.

## Force  Development and  Training

During fiscal  year 1982  the  Army  moved  forward with  plans and programs to  develop modern, well-equipped, adequately supported, and fully trained forces that would be  capable of meeting military contingencies wherever they  might arise. Eu› rope  and  the  might  of Warsaw  Pact forces  arrayed along  NATO's eastern  flank  continued to be the  principal  threat, and  the  greater effort  was made  to counter it; but  the  need  to have  highly  mobile, quick  reaction forces  available for  commitment to  other critical areas,  such  as  the  Persian Gulf,  was  a  growing concern.

## Force Development

Early  in  the fiscal  year the Vice  Chief of  staff directed the Army  staff  to  prepare a  plan that would  integrate and  provide unified direction for the Army's force modernization efforts. The  result was  the  Force Modernization Master Plan  (FMMP), which  was published in  April 1982.  It  contained a compendium of  modernization goals  and  objectives,  a detailed "roadmap" for transition of the  force  from  its current structure to a modernized one,  and a  methodology for  assessing the  Army's capability to carry  out  its modernization plans.  From  May to August  the Army's major  commands assessed their ability  to  execute the  plan. As the  year  closed, issues  raised by  the  commands were  being  re› solved  and changes were being incorporated into an  updated FMMP  to  be  published early  in  fiscal  year 1983.  Of  particular concern was the  question of  unit stationing in  USAREUR.

The Army  90  Transition Plan, a  detailed schedule of  the actions  required to  implement Army  86  designs for  improving the  operational effectiveness of  units  and  increasing the  combat effectiveness of  both  existing and  new  systems,  formed part of the  FMMP.  Major  features of  the  plan  included converting units to new designs  as major  pacing  items-such as the  Bradley  fight› ing  vehicle  and  the  M 1 tank-are received; converting units to transitional designs  as facilities  and  manpower resources become available, thus  improving the  combat effectiveness of  the  exist› ing  force  by achieving the  capability  to execute advanced tactical concepts  using  current weapon  and  support systems;  converting division  support commands to  the  maximum extent possible  as

major  pacing  items  are  fielded; and  converting reserve compo› nent  roundout units  at  the  same  time  as their  parent units  in  the active Army.  Reserve  component divisions  and  separate brigades would  begin  converting in  fiscal year  1985. The  plan  also showed, through an  extract from the  Force  Accounting System,  all  cur› rently planned unit activations, inactivations, and conversions for  fiscal  years 1984-1992.

A flurry  of  activity  had  preceded publication of  the  first  edi› tion  of  the  FMMP  and  the  Army  90 Transition Plan.  During the first  quarter of  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  staff  reviewed tables  of organization and  equipment (TOEs)  for  the  Army  86 heavy  divi› sion  (Division  86)  prepared at  TRADOC .  The review  process considerably increased the  size of  certain divisional  units,  to  the point  that  there  were  more  people in  the  division  than  the  force structure allowed.  As a result,  TRADOC received  instructions in January 1982  to  redesign Division  86  within  a  prescribed active component ceiling of  between 17,750  and 18,750 .  During the entire month of  February a  task  force representing TRADOC, USAREUR,  FORSCOM  (U.S. Army  Forces  Command), and  the Army  staff  worked  at  Fort  Leavenworth on  a revised  Division  86 design and a  transition plan for the  divisiona l  reorganization. TRADOC  presented the  results of  the task  force's efforts at  a decision  briefing on  5  March. Later in  the  month the  Chief  of Staff approved the  TRADOC  design  calling  for  nine  active battal › ions  (five  tank  and four mechanized infantry) and  one  reserve battalion (tank  for  armor divisions  and  mechanized infantry for infantry divisions, mechanized) with  the  following changes: all medical companies would be  placed in  the medical battalion; rifle  squads would  have  ten  members in  both M 113- and  M2equipped squads;  and  the  tenth  battalion of USAREUR  divisions would  be  an  active  rather than reserve component. To  ensure adequate support, the Chief of  Staff rejected fielding the Ml tank  and the  Bradley fighting vehicle  in  less  than full  division sets. He  also  approved transition plan  guidelines.

Another  aspect  of Army  86 planning, the  airborne-air assault division, continued under study at TRADOC. As  currently developed, the  new  airborne division  would  feature nine  infan› try battalions plus one mobile protected gun battalion and a cavalry  brigade (air  attack)  as  maneuver units. Division  artillery would contain  three  direct  support  battalions  equipped with M 198 155-mm.  howitzers, but  no  general support battalion .  Planning at  the close  of  the fiscal  year envisaged an  air  assault division built  around nine  infantry battalions and  a cavalry  brigade (air attack)  having the  capability to  lift  the combat  elements of  two

maneuver battalions. Artillery components would  be the  same  as for the  airborne division. A  decision briefing for the  Chief of Staff  (CSA) on  operational concepts  and  force  designs  was sched› uled for early 1983.  Upon CSA  approval, TOEs will  be pro› duced  and  programming for  transition will begin .

On  29 April  1982  the  Commander, Combined Arms  Center, briefed the  Chief of  Staff  and major command leaders on  the status  of  Echelons Above  Corps 86  force  designs and  doctrine. Several  issues  were  identified for  further study,  primarily ques› tions regarding functional (stovepipe)  and  operational commands. An important result  of the  meeting was the  publication of a draft of  FM  100-16, "Support Operations Echelons Above  Corps," which  serves  as interim "how  to support" doctrine for  the  Army. During fiscal  year 1983  the  draft of  FM  100- 16  will  undergo additional review  before final  publication.

The Army  took  steps  during fiscal  year 1982  to  further its High  Technology Test  Bed  (HTTB) program, which  consists  of TRADOC  and  DARCOM  assets, as well as those  of the  9th  Infan› try  Division,  I Corps,  and  Fort  Lewis,  Washington. The  program goal  is  to  field a  prototype of  a  strategically deployable, lean, hard-hitting, and  sustainable light  division (HTLD) in  1985.  In October 1981 intensive work  began  on  developing this  division's operational concept and organizational designs. In  April 1982 the  HTLD  operational and  organizational design  was approved by  Headquarters, Department of  the  Army,  and  plans  were  be› gun  for  testing  and  transition. In  May the  initial HTLD materiel requirements were  approved, and HTLD funding requirements were  added  to Army  resourcing documents . In  September, plans were  completed for  transforming a brigade slice of  9th  Infantry Division  units  to  the HTLD configuration in  fiscal  year 1983 for evaluation and  testing .

The  Army  initiated ,  through the  Joint Chiefs of  Staff, an analytica l examination of  the  potential force  mix  needed to meet national security objectives. Major features of  the analysis in› cluded compiling all pertinent policy guidance into a  single document ,  establishing a  methodology to  consider all  facets of rel evant  variables, defining and refining an applicable target base, comput er mod eling,  and  executing  potential  force  scenarios . The resu lting  product will be  updated on  a continuing basis and refined thro ugh  the  PPBES  (Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and  Execu tion  System)  process to  provide force  structures that can be comb ined  with  other  factors,  such  as dollar  costs, in order to  pres ent  a  choice of  viable  alternative s  for meeting national security  objectives.

Force  mix analysis efforts  and  the  damage  criteria  study  noted in  last  year's summary supported the  administration's drive to modernize and  expand U.S. strategic forces.  As an  active  partici› pant  in  this  effort, the  Army  tried to  ensure that  a  healthy per› spective was  maintained on  what  was  required for a  balanced deterrent. While  there was no  question of the  need  for  an  effec› tive  strategic deterrent, the  high  cost  of  such  systems  could  lead to  a  deficit in  the conventional capabilities that were  also  re› quired for  a  balanced deterrent. The Army  worked to  ensure that  conventional forces  were  neither neglected nor  allowed  to deteriorate for,  if  they  were,  the  result could  be  restrictive and undesirable choices  in  responding to  expected challenges from potential enemies.

In  October 1981, the  Army  began  a reorganization of division› level  hospitals to  improve medical  care  for  the  combat zone.  A key element  of the  reorganization was changing the  surgical  hos› pital (mobile  army) TOE to  a  new  TOE which  was  given  the name  mobile  army  surgical  hospital (MASH).  The  revised  struc› ture  was designed to  increase mobility  and  better support a fast› moving  tactical  scenario, while  at  the same  time  providing an acceptable emergency surgical-resuscitative capability. In  addi› tion  to  the new  MASH,  the  reorganization would  allocate  one combat support hospital and two  evacuation hospitals to  each combat  division.  Full implementation of the  reorganization, which would  occur  over  a five-year  period, would  increase the  number of hospital  beds  from  800  to  1,060  and  the  number of operating rooms  from  fourteen to  twenty-two in  each  supported division; would  provide a  hospital unit  that  was  staffed and  equipped to operate  on  a continuous 24-hour  basis rather than  on a "sustained basis"; and would introduce a  highly intensive, surgically ori› ented  unit  which  could  be  located  adjacent to  the  division's  rear boundary and  which  would provide continuous support-even in  areas  where helicopter air  ambulances could  ~ot  be  used.

The  Force  Development Directorate, ODCSOPS,  completed work on a revision  of Army  Regulation 71-11,  "Total  Army  Anal› ysis (T AA),"  and  publication was scheduled for  early  fiscal  year 1983. The  revision  changed the  T AA  from  an  annual study  to a biennial  one.  Following  a review  by the  Army  staff  and  the  major commands, the  directorate hosted  a three-day conference which began  on  14 September 1982 to consider the  proposed T AA-89 force  for  development in  the  Program Objective  Memorandum (POM)  covering fiscal  years 1985-1989. The General Officer Steering Committee met  on  17 September to  resolve issues  left hanging  at the  conference, to review  the  base  force,  and  to make

final  recommendations for  presentation at  the  Select  Committee (SELCOM)  meeting scheduled for November 1982.

## Sustainability

An  important element in determining the compos1t1on  of forces  to be  developed is how  well they  can  be  sustained overseas under combat conditions. Important factors in  this  regard are war  reserves, POMCUS,  host  nation  support, and  rationalization, standardization, and  interoperability.

In  February 1981  the  U.S.  Army  Logistics  Evaluation Agency (USALEA)  reported on  its study  of  management policies,  proce› dures,  and  programs covering  secondary items  in the  war  reserve. The  report noted  four  major  problem areas  that  hampered effec› tive  war reserve management: (1)  insufficient central control and  direction; (2) ineffectual or  conflicting guidance and  inade› quate instructions for preparing war  reserve budgets; (3)  con› fusing, conflicting, and cumbersome selection procedures; and (4) inadequate management information. Short-range and  long› range actions  recommended in  the  report to  correct these  prob› lems  have  been accepted and are being implemented by DAR› COM  and  the  Army  staff.

To  improve the accuracy of  war reserve asset information reported by  major commands, the U.S.  Army Logistics Center (LOGCEN) developed and tested a  standard report for  world› wide  use  having  common data  elements that  would  be  auditable. The fruit of this effort, the War Reserve Reporting System (ALS-8),  was implemented in June 1982  as part  of  the  Standard Army Intermediate Level Supply System-Expanded (SAILS› ABX).

The  major  change in  the  pre-positioning of  materiel config› ured to  unit sets (POMCUS) during fiscal year 1982  was  the realignment of  logistical and medical support packages in  the divisional sets. POMCUS fill increased in Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) during the year, but declined in  Central Army  Group (CENT  AG)  because of  the effects of  redesigned USAREUR force requirements and POMCUS restructuring. Funding for  spare parts has  raised the  fill of  authorized stockage lists-prescribed stockage lists  (ASL-PSL) to  an  all-time high.

Construction started on  shortage sites  for  POMCUS division set  five  in Belgium and the Netherlands, and land aquisition began  in  the  Netherlands for  set  six.  Although Congress deleted funding for these sets  in  the fiscal  year 1982  budget, this  pre› sented  no  problem since  land  procurement and  site construction had  been delayed. A  skeletal force from the 7th  Support Com-

mand and a  small element of the 54th Area Support Group moved  into  the  area  of  Rheinberg, Germany, to  plan,  coordinate, receive,  and  provide initial support for  the  reinforcing divisions which  are part of  the NORTHAG expansion. The 54th Area Support Group will  also  provide community support activities for  U.S.  personnel assigned in the  vicinity.

The  Army  continued to emphasize host  nation  support (HNS) to satisfy  some  of  its combat support and  combat  service  support requirements. The use  of  HNS resources to  complement U.S. military capabilities and force structure, within the bounds of prudent risk, is  considered essential to  attain the support level necessary  for  maximum combat  power  of  forward deployed and deploying U.S.  forces.

Following lengthy negotiations, the United States and the Federal Republic of  Germany (FRG)  signed a  host nation sup› port  agreement on  15 April 1982.  It  calls  for  additional negotia› tions  on  three technical agreements covering military support, civilian support, and reinforcement exercises. The agreement on  military support will  provide for the formation of  German reserve units  containing approximately 93,000  reservists, whose mission  will be  to  support U.S.  air  and ground forces  in  time  of crisis or  war.  As the  fiscal year  ended, U.S.-FRG working groups were  putting together details of  the  military support agreement; the  reinforcement exercise agreement was  in  draft; while  work on  the  civilian  support agreement was expected to get  under way early  in  fiscal  year 1983.

Regarding other NATO-related HNS  matters, progress was made  on  the  preparation of joint logistical  support plans  to cover the  details of  host  nation support provided under umbrella and general technical agreements which the U.S. has signed with Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Italy. Also,  USEUCOM initiated action to  estab› lish  logistics coordination cells  to  operate as  in-country exten› sions of the  command in developing joint logistics  support plans.

Host  nation support in  Korea is  provided through the  com› bined defense improvement projects (CDIP) program, and in Japan by  arrangements for base rentals and construction cost avoidance. Elsewhere in  the  Pacific, HNS  was  in  a  rudimentary state.  WESTCOM (Western Command) has  begun the  friendly› allied  nation support (FANS)  program to  determine the  ability of  countries to  provide support. In  Southwest Asia,  U.S.  policy was to begin  discussions with  selected countries on  possible  con› tingency support for  U.S.  forces. Although the  political climate has  inhibited initiatives, some progress has  been made in  the

areas  of  access agreements, pre-positioning, and  the  start  of HNS talks.

In the  area  of  rationalization, standardization, and  interoper› ability,  the primary effort continued to  be  the  establishment of standardization agreements (ST ANAG)  and  interoperable weap› ons  systems, logistics, equipment, and procedures in  order to conserve resources and  increase the  combined combat  capability of  U.S.  and allied ground forces. Concept and  doctrinal issues, including AirLand Battle 2000  and  land  force tactical  doctrine, were  also  raised. The Army, through participation in  an  inter› service working group, actively supported the development, operation, and  maintenance of  an  automated system  to  manage the status and implementation of  standardization agreements, allied  publications, and  quadripartite standardization agreements.

The Department of  the  Army International Rationalization Office  (DAIRO) was  disbanded and  its  functions transferred to the  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  of  Operations and  Plans. In  conjunction with  the  demise  of DAIRO, AR 34-1,  "U.S.  Army Participation in  International Military Rationalization and  Stan› dardization Interoperability Programs," and  AR 34-2,  "Rational› ization, Standardization, and Interoperability Policy,"  came  un› der revision. The result is  expected to be  a  single regulation which  will incorporate both policy  and program .

Bilateral Army  staff  talks  were held with  the armies of  the Federal Republic  of  Germany, France,  and  the  United Kingdom . AirLand Battle 2000 figured prominently among the topics discussed. The U.S.-Canadian Permanent Joint Board for De› fense and the Canadian-U.S. Cooperation Committee also  met to  discuss matters of mutual interest. The Army took part in NATO  Army  Armaments Group (NAAG)  panels and  working groups . At  the Military Agency  for  Standardization (MAS),  the Army  participated in  the promulgation of  31  new  STANAGs and  allied  publications, the  amendment of  197 others, and  vari› ous  actions to develop and ratify 109  more .  ST AN AG  2868/ ATP-35(A), Land Force Tactical Doctrine, was  forwarded to participating governments for  final  review  and  is expected to  be ratified in  early 1983 .

## Mobilization

Mobilization efforts during fiscal  year 1982  focused on  the following issues : reviews of  mobilization and  deployment plan › ning,  continued development of augmentation and  preassignment programs to provide pretrained individuals to Regular Army

and  reserve  component units  upon mobilization or  in  a national emergency,  use  of  civilian  personnel, and  industrial mobilization.

Based  on  initiatives  by the  Secretary of  Defense and  Chief  of Staff,  the  Army  conducted two  mobilization planning reviews  in March  1982. The  first,  held  on  6 March,  considered the  Mobiliza› tion Acquisition  Plan,  the  update  to the  Remedial  Action  Program, and  FORSCOM  and  TRADOC Remedial Action  Program man› agement. On  25  March  the  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  chaired a general officer mobilization review  which  all  those in  charge of  major commands  attended. The  meeting's agenda  included the  Mobili› zation  Aquisition Plan,  MOBEX  83, and  mobilization issues  facing FORSCOM,  TRADOC, and  DARCOM.  If program deficiencies uncovered at  the meetings are not  resolved satisfactorily, both reviews  will be  conducted again  in  fiscal  year 1983.

Full  implementation of  the Army  Mobilization and  Opera› tion  Planning System  (AMOPS)  moved  forward during the  past year  with  the  publication of  AMOPS  Volume  II,  "Strategic Em› ployment  of Army  Forces,"  and  Volume  IV,  "Army  Crisis Action System."  Volumes I  and III had  been  published in  1981.

Following  publication of  a  critical Inspector General report in January 1982,  the  Army  staff  acted  to  develop a more  timely process  for  producing mobilization training requirements. The ODCSOPS  Training Directorate assisted ODCSPER  in  revising an  automated system  to  give it the  capacity  to  produce mobiliza› tion  training requirements. This  joint effort neared completion by  the  end of  the  fiscal  year. The Mobilization Army  Program for  Individual Training (MOB  ARPRINT) was  significantly re› fined to  reflect course capacities more  accurately and  to  deter› mine  requirements for  functional or  non-MOS courses . A  spe› cial  ODCSOPS task force met during the year to prepare a blueprint for  mobilization training in  a constrained environment. The task force, called WARTRAIN, examined manpower, facilities, stationing, base  support, manning, structure, and  equip› ment requirements for providing trained manpower during a full  mobilization. The  task  force  determined that  equipment re› mained the pacing item for any  emergency expansion of  the training base,  that  a continuous review  of  equipment availability was  necessary to  project the  effects on  training base  capacities, and  that there was  a  need to  review  and improve mobilization plans  and  to  focus  on  a  comprehensive training strategy.

Implementation of  the  retiree preassignment and  recall  pro› gram gained momentum during fiscal  year 1982.  The Army began issuing recall preassignment orders in  November 1981, and  by the  end  of fiscal year  1982, more  than  97,000  retirees had

received  "hip  pocket"  mobilization  preassignment orders  to Army installations within  the  continental United  States.  Another 2,100 retirees  residing in  Europe also received  orders. Most were  invol› untarily assigned Regular Army  retirees under the  age  of  sixty; but  some  1,300  were  volunteers, both  above  and  below  age  sixty and  both regular and reserve retirees. Reserve retirees can  be contingently preassigned, but  can  be  recalled  only  after  a declara› tion  of  war  or  national emergency by  Congress, and  only  after the  Secretary of Defense  has concurred with  the  Secretary of  the Army's  determination that  no  other reservists are  available.

During the past year the Army identified approximately 48,000  reserve retirees for  preassignment. These assets  will be matched against remaining retiree requirements and, where appropriate, contingent preassignment orders will be  issued in fiscal year  1983.  The  Army  also expanded the  retiree recall  pro› gram  to  include preassignment to  nondeploying MTOE  units.

On  1 October 1981, the  Mobilization  Designation (MOBDES) Program was redesignated the  Individual Mobilization  Augmen› tation (IMA)  Program. All  participants became  members of  the Selected Reserve and subject to  active  duty service under the President's authority to  call  up 100,000  selected reservists for  a period of  one  year.  In  November the  program was expanded to include assignment to active Army MTOE  units .  This action significantly enlarged the  scope,  size,  and  impact of  the  Army's premobilization assignment effort and,  for  the  first  time,  allowed large  numbers of junior enlisted personnel to be  included in  the program. By  the close  of  the fiscal  year, approximately 7,800 selected reservists were  preassigned to  positions they  would  fill upon  mobilization under the  IMA  Program.

Mobilization  of civilians  to meet  wartime  production and  sup› port  requirements received  unprecedented emphasis  during fis› cal  year 1982.  The Civilian Personnel Center's San  Francisco field  office  conducted a  thorough study  of  civilian  mobilization planning within  the  continental United States  during the  period January-May 1982  to  determine how  well  major Army  civilian personnel offices  were  carrying out  assigned responsibilities in this  area. The  study  report recommended numerous actions to improve mobilization readiness. One  of  the  most  significant was a complete  revision  of the  Army's  regulation on civilian  mobiliza› tion planning, which  was  completed by  the close  of  the fiscal year.

Other  actions  taken  during fiscal year  1982 to improve  mobili› zation planning and management included discerning civilian employees who  are reservists or  retired military members in

preparation for automating this  data early  in  fiscal  year 1982; identifying civilian  positions and  employee assignments accord› ing  to  their status  during mobilization; and  determining retired military  members who  serve  in  key  positions and  submitting re› quests for their exemption from recall to  active  duty during a mobilization.  In  addition, civilian personnel offices  servicing  more than one  command were  directed to  establish priorities for  as› signing  available persons among serviced activities  having com› mon  requirements during mobilization.  Overseas  commands were to determine the  CO NUS  assignments of civilian  employees who would  be  evacuated in  the  event of  mobilization or  hostilities.

The  Army  took  several  actions  during fiscal  year 1982 in the area of  industrial preparedness to promote the development and  maintenance of  an  industrial base  able  to  support military operations during peacetime and  mobilization.

Army  Regulation 700-90, "Army Industrial Preparedness Program," published in  March 1982,  consolidated the Army's policy  and  procedures for  industrial preparedness into  a  single document. Three new  Department of  Defense regulations4005.1, "Industrial Resources"; 4005.2, "Industrial Prepared› ness  Planning"; and  4005.3,  "Industrial Preparedness Planning Man\_ual"-also provided guidance in  this  area. They were  the product of the  joint task force formed to  carry out the De› partment of Defense Action Plan for improving industrial preparedness, noted in  last  year's report.

In  another joint effort, the Undersecretary of  Defense for Research  and  Engineering sponsored a triservice  committee  which drafted a DOD  instruction supporting an  expanded Army  Indus› trial  Productivity Improvement program and  an  Air  Force  Tech› nology Modernization program. In addition, the instruction would  encourage industry through contract incentives  to increase substantially capital  investments in  productivity-enhancing tech› nology, processes, and modern plants and equipment for de› fense  work. Special  emphasis would  be  given  to  increasing the productivity of  subcontractors and  vendors. By the  close  of  the fiscal  year the proposed program had  been informally coordi› nated with the military services, with the Defense Logistics Agency,  and  with  industry and  had  been  well  received. Formal coordination and  implementation should be  underway early  in fiscal  year 1983.

ODCSRDA  (Office  of the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Research, Development, and  Acquisition) specialists conducted numerous field trips across the country in  support of  the Army's assess› ments  of  the  industrial base.  Prime  contractors and  subcontrac-

tors  were visited to  determine how  well  their plants could re› spond to  multiple demands from the three military services. Extensive  interdependence among  weapon  systems  and  the  sup› porting subcontract structure was  discerned. For example, Hughes  Aircraft  Corporation, the  prime  contractor for  the  AH-64 helicopter, was a subcontractor for  the  TOW  2 missile.  In  many cases,  a single  contractor supplied the  military services  with  sim› ilar  products for  use  in  different weapon systems.

During the  spring of  fiscal  year 1982  the  Army  assisted  the Department of  Commerce in  a  study to  evaluate the nation's need for foundry capacity during peacetime and during mobilization.  The  Department of  Commerce was especially  inter› ested in  assessing the impact of  military procurement on the economy  of  the  country in  peace and  war.  The Army  reported that  it experienced no difficulties  in meeting  casting  requirements, even  large  or  unusual ones.  The  Department of  Commerce study was expected to  help the  foundry industry project future busi› ness  and  capital improvements.

## Training  and  Schooling

The  Army's  training goal  is to  develop and  sustain a compe› tent, combat-ready Total Army prepared to  mobilize, deploy, fight,  and  defeat any  enemies of  the  United States  in  support of worldwide national commitments. To  this  end, the  Army  must be  ready to  undertake and support wartime missions on  short notice, regardless of  type unit, component, or  branch. Forces must  then be  sustained through well-planned, -supported, and -executed mobilization procedures. Despite a  changing world environment and threat, the Army's  training mission will  not change significantly over  time . It will  continue to  train and  de› velop  soldiers, teams, crews,  units, and forces individually and collectively  to  become combat-ready combined arms  forces.

Well-trained units  capable of  carrying out  their  wartime mis› sions  are developed by  skilled commanders and leaders who know how to plan, manage, and conduct mission-oriented training. Approved strategy gives  commanders a  long-term fo› cus for Total  Army  training. It creates  an  integrated, war-fighting, mission-oriented theme  to  prepare active  Army  and  reserve  com› ponent forces and establishes the training base  for peace and war.  Strategy provides the  framework to  deal  with  the  changes associated with force modernization, doctrine, tactics, threat, organization, demography, and technology and to  realize full potential, capitalize on  increased capabilities, and  exploit  oppor-

tunities. The training principles of  decentralization, moderni› zation, standardization, and sustainment provide the structure for  follow-up plans of  action, such  as  Army Training 1990,  to support the  Army readiness goal: generating and sustaining a modern, combat-ready, well-led, and  supported total  force that can  fight  and  win.

Better management of training resources continued to  be emphasized during fiscal  year 1982.  A  major element of  this effort was  the  Armywide Standardization Program, which  had the objective of  standardizing procedures used by  soldiers to operate and  maintain major systems,  thereby saving  time  spent teaching local  modifications of  basic  tasks  and  reducing retrain› ing  requirements for  soldiers  joining a  new  unit. Phase  I  of  the program, which has  already been implemented, was  oriented toward  combat  arms  units  and  involved  drills  that  relate  to soldier› crew functioning on weapons or equipment, for example, gunnery-crew drills,  biological  and  chemical  procedures, and  com› bat  vehicle  preoperational checks.  Phase  II  of  the  program, which began in 1981,  was  an  ongoing effort by  schools, centers, and major  commands to  identify possible  procedures for  standardi› zation.  Training and  Doctrine Command had  overall  responsibil› ity  for the program, while  schools and  centers and designated chiefs from  the  Department of the  Army  standardization branches were  responsible for  all  aspects  of  the  program which  pertained to  their specialties. An  Inspector General investigation of  the program carried out  during fiscal  year 1982  uncovered several problems  that  required attention, which  will lead  to some  redirec› tion  in  the  coming fiscal  year.  The inspection report also  found that commanders supported the spirit of  standardization and that  numerous initiatives were  under way.

Improved management of  training resources was  also  the objective  of  the  Standards In  Training Commission, which  was formed to determine the  amount of  ammunition needed to train and  sustain  crews  and  individuals at  a prescribed readiness level. The  commission  developed standard training strategies  for  thirty› eight  weapons  systems,  which  will be  implemented in  the  field  in fiscal  year 1984,  and identified training ammunition require› ments, which  will  be  used by  program and  decision makers in preparing and  justifying the fiscal year 1984  budget request. Efforts were begun to  expand the scope of the commission's work  to  cover  management of  time,  fuel,  spare parts, and  train› ing  land  and  ranges.

Training devices and simulations had become increasingly important in  recent years in  getting the most  out of  training

resources. During the  past  year  a  regulation on  training device policy  and  management was staffed, and  publication is expected in  fiscal  year 1983.  In  June 1982  the  Training Directorate of ODCSOPS  sponsored and  the  Army  Training Support Center hosted  the  Army's  first  Worldwide Training Devices  Conference with  the  objective of  laying out training device strategy-how devices  are  developed, acquired, supported, and  used.  Presenta› tions  included the  work  and methodology of  the Standards in Training Commission, a white  paper on  streamlining acquisition of  institution-type simulators, and  lessons  learned from  fielding battle  simulation devices.  During  June and  July  of  1982  the  De› fense  Science  Board conducted a summer study  on  training and related technology. Out  of it came  a recommendation to consoli› date  and  increase funding for  research in  these  areas.

The  Director of  Training, ODCSOPS,  chartered the  Train› ing  Aids  Work  Group to  develop alternatives and  recommend improvements in  providing and  supporting efficient and  effec› tive  training for  the  active  Army and  the  reserve components. Participating in  the  work  group would  be  the  Training Support Division, Directorate of Training, ODCSOPS;  ANG;  Office,  Chief Army  Reserve (OCAR); TRADOC; DARCOM; FORSCOM; USAREUR; and USAHSC. The Training Aids  Work Group would  focus  its work  on  policy,  management, organization, and procedures for devices and simulators, literature and graphic aids, and audiovisual products and user-operated audiovisual equipment. A  report of  issues,  findings, and  recommendations will be  provided to  the  Director of  Training in  February 1983.

Field  validation testing  of the  Training Management Control System (TMACS)-an automated aid  to help  the  unit  commander at  the  battalion, brigade, or  division  level to  plan  training, evalu› ate  the  benefits and resource impact of  training plans, and  re› cord  training accomplished and  resources expended-was suc› cessfully  completed at  Fort  Carson, Colorado, in  February 1982, and  equipment distribution to  the field  began .  During the  pe› riod  April-May 1982,  FORSCOM  held  courses  for  unit  trainers in the  use  of the  system  at  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas.  The  train› ers  then accepted TMACS  equipment into their units and in› structed their  own  people  in its use.  By the  close of the  reporting period, 215 TMACS  sets had  been  delivered to the  field,  and  the Army  was  studying interfaces between TMACS  and  other sys› tems  to  further relieve the  training management burden borne by unit  commanders.

The opening class  of  the First Sergeant Course got  under way at  the  U.S.  Army Sergeants Major  Academy on  5  October

1981. The  purpose of  the  course  was to prepare senior  noncom› missioned  officers  for  the  position  of  first  sergeant in a company , battery, troop, or  similar-sized unit. The curriculum included physical training, field operations, training management, unit administration, personnel actions, logistics, unit security, dis› cipline,  soldier problems, and  communication skills.  Five  eight› week  classes  offered in  fiscal  year 1982  had a  capacity of  312 students. Six  classes  capable of  handling 384  students will  be offered in  fiscal  year 1983.  USAREUR also  planned to  offer a first  sergeant course in  1983  for  some  300  students.

During  fiscal year  1982,  2,223  active  Army  and  many  reserve intelligence specialists participated in  the Tactical Intelligence Readiness Training (REDTRAIN) Program. Training was  fo› cused  on  in-unit activities  and intelligence production. For  the first time  participants included intelligence specialists assigned to  special forces and psychological operations units as  well  as personnel from the intelligence staffs of  tactical battalions. TROJAN,  an  associated  program, will bring  live intercepted sig› nals  to  signal  intelligence specialists at  two  FORSCOM installa› tions in fiscal year  1983 and  to USAREUR's 1st Armored Division.

The Skill  Qualification Test (SQT) program continued to come  under fire during fiscal  year 1982.  At  the Army  Com› mander's Conference held in  October 1981  there was  general agreement that  steps  should be taken  to streamline the  program, make  it more  flexible,  and  minimize  the  "surge"  aspect  of individ› ual  training and  evaluation. TRADOC  received  the  task of adapt› ing  the  program to meet  these  objections. Staffing  ofTRADOC's proposals to  modify the  SQT  was influenced by a draft audit  of the  program prepared by the  General  Accounting Office  (GAO), which was released in January 1982. The  audit  was highly  critical of  the program, as  was  the  final GAO  report dated 30  March 1982.

On  22  April 1982  the  Chief of  Staff approved changes to streamline the  SQT  program. A core  or  common-task test  would be given  to all soldiers  up  to the  grade  of E-4.  Rules  for  adminis› tration and the application of  results for personnel manage› ment  would  be  flexible  and  based  upon the  local  commander's judgment. Hands-on tests of military  occupational specialty  (MOS) tasks  would  be  designed by  the  unit  commander; the  results of the  evaluations would  not  be  used  directly for  consideration of promotion, but  would  be  used  by  supervisors in  preparing the soldier's overall performance rating. Also,  performance-based, written tests  of  generic MOS  skills  would be  given  annually to most  soldiers  in  skill levels  1- 4.  These test  scores  would  be  used

as objective  indicators for  promotions and  other personnel man› agement decisions. To  improve equity  and  test  validity,  as well as simplify  administration, test  notices  would  only  list possible  tasks to  be  tested.

These  changes  closely  paralleled recommendations contained in  the  GAO's  audit report in  March. But  while  the  Army sup› ported the thrust of the GAO's  recommendations, it did not agree with  the  agency's assertion that the  SQT  was  ineffective. The  Army  continued to  maintain that  the  SQT  was "a  principal tool  in  the  simulation and  evaluation of  individual skill  training and  proficiency," that  the  program "has  been  an  effective  indica› tor  for  promotion and  other personnel management decisions," and  that, except for a  small  number of  tests  which have  been discarded, "SQTs  are  as valid  or  more  valid  than  any  comparable test  instrument used  to  assess  individual task  proficiency."

Meanwhile,  following  a GAO  briefing  on  the  SQT  audit,  Con› gress  reduced spending for  the  program in  fiscal year  1982 from $18  million to  $9  million in  December 1981.  After the Army briefed Congress in  June 1982  on  the reforms made in the program, Congress restored $4  million for  the  development of SQTs  in  fiscal  year 1983.

Eight brigade task  force training rotations were  completed during the first year of  operations at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California. Amex  Corporation finished in› stalling  an  extensive  instrumentation system at the  center  to moni› tor  and  evaluate unit  performance during live-fire  exercises  and force-on-force maneuvers. TRADOC and the  Combined Arms Center  will analyze  unit  performance data  to determine "lessons learned" with  regard to  training doctrine and  tactics.

During fiscal  year 1982,  Military Operations on  Urbanized Terrain (MOUT)  training for  NATO and  CONUS-based forces continued to  be  limited by a lack  of  training facilities.  However, the  increased emphasis on  MOUT  doctrine and  training during the  previous year's  programming efforts yielded  the  Army's  first new MOUT  training facility  at  Fort  Bragg, North Carolina. This facility  was completed in July 1982  and  will serve  as a prototype for  future construction in  FORSCOM, USAREUR,  and  WEST› COM.  TRADOC's Directorate for  Army  Ammunition, Ranges, and  Targets (DAART) has  also  developed a  prototype MOUT facility  and a  combat assault course for  individual skills.  FORS› COM  is expected to  program some  of  these facilities for fiscal year 1985  and 1986,  depending on  the  availability of  military construction funds.

Army  forces  participated in  ten  exercises directed by the JCS and thirty-two exercises coordinated by  the  JCS in  fiscal  year

1982 at a cost of $67  million.  These  included two command post exercises  sponsored by the JCS;  two major  field  training  exercises, TEAM SPIRIT 82  in  Korea  and  BRIGHT ST  AR 82  in  Egypt;  and BOLD EAGLE,  a large-scale  USCINCRED field  training exercise carried out  in  the  continental United  States. Joint exercises  pro› vided  the  opportunity, often  not  obtainable in any other  training situation,  to accomplish  specific objectives  in the  areas  of  mobility, command and  control, and  communications.

REFORGER  82, conducted in  September 1982, was the  largest JCS  exercise  of  the  year  and  the  fourteenth in  the  annual series of  exercises  begun in  1968.  It  involved the  deployment of  over 18,000 Army  soldiers  and  their  equipment from  the  continental United  States to Europe in 212 C-141  and  C-5A  aircraft  and  in 3 roll-on-roll-off (RO-RO)  ships,  which  moved  over  1,500 wheeled and  tracked vehicles  to  Europe. Army  CONUS  units  included most of  the  1st Infantry Division  (Mechanized), the  3d  Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 3d Brigade (-)  of the 82d Airborne Division,  the  III  Corps  battle  staff,  and  an  engineer battalion of the  USAR.

Over  58,000 USAREUR  soldiers  participated with the CO NUS deploying  forces  in Europe. CENT A G's CARBINE  FORTRESS  was a  field training exercise conducted in  the  central and eastern parts  of  the  Federal Republic  of Germany  involving  over  72,000 NA TO  personnel.

Major  innovations in REFORGER  82  included a  substantial effort to  adhere to  and  evaluate war  plans;  a no-notice exercise, GOLDEN  THUNDER, which  rapidly  deployed an  Army  battalion from  CO NUS to Europe; deployment of a USAR engineer  battal› ion to Europe; deployment from CONUS of two  airborne battalions, which  parachuted into  Germany; and  tactical  cross› ings  of  the  Rhine  and  Main  rivers .

## Army  Study  Program

The  Army  Study  Program is designed to  provide the  means, through formal  analytic  effort, for  the  Army  to examine critical problems and  improve the  quality  and  usefulness of  analyses  in support of  planning, programming, and budgeting decisions. Studies  are  defined as a broad  class of intellectual activity charac› terized  by the  application of  the  tools  of operational and  systems analysis.

Approximately 360  studies  were  worked  on  during fiscal year 1982,  about 54  percent of  which  were  continuations of  efforts begun  earlier. The  studies  covered a wide  range  of  topics , from

innovative concepts to  applications of  new  technology. About two-thirds  of the  studies  were  conducted solely by Army  military and  civilian  members of  study  organizations; about half  of  the balance  that  were  conducted under contract also  had  participa› tion  by Army  study  personnel.

Studies related to  operations and force structure required over 55  percent of the in-house analytical staff time  and ac› counted for  about  24 percent of the  contract funds.  Studies  deal› ing  with  science,  technology, systems,  and  equipment accounted for  about 17 percent of  the  in-house staff  and  about  34 percent of the  contract funds.  The  balance  of contract  effort  (  42 percent) was  distributed over personnel, logistics, management, intelli› gence,  and  planning studies. Total contract expenditures were about $15  million; in-house staff time  represents about $117 million.  Thus the  total study program in  fiscal  year 1982  was somewhat  more  than  $130  million.

A  major new  development in  support of  the Army  Study Program was the  establishment of  an  Army  studies  and  analyis element at  the  California Institute of  Technology's Jet Propul› sion  Laboratory. The element, which  began conducting Army studies late  in  the fiscal  year, will  meet the  need for forward› looking  policy  and  technical studies to  support Army  planning and  programming for  future change.

During  the  past  year  the  Chief  of Staff changed  the  methodol› ogy used  to choose  the  subjects  addressed by Army  studies . Prior› ity problem area analysis, the previous technique, consisted of ten general areas-including force design, manpower, modernization, and  training-used to  guide  studies  toward  prob› lems of critical importance to the  Army.  While logically appealing, the  procedure suffered from  three basic  problems: the  priority areas  were  very  broad; in the  field,  the  problems changed  by the time  the  elabor ate  analytical process identified th em;  and the process  was not  universally understood. The  Office  of the  Chief of  Staff  found no  convincing evidence that  the  effort expended produced a commensurate improvement in  studies  management. After  some experimentation with  substituting major  mission  state› ments  for  priority area  analysis,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Staff issued  a statement on  7 December 1981 of Total  Army  goals and performance management initiatives, which  directed that each staff  agency  assign  one  point  of  contact for  Army  studies .

## Manning  the  Army

The  most  important asset  in  the  Total Army  is people. Qual› ity  people ,  adequately trained and in  sufficient numbers in  all components-active, reserve, and  civilian-are the  key to success in maintaining the  Army's combat capability.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  active  Army  succeeded in  meet› ing  both  qualitative and  quantitative recruitment goals, in large measure because of  the  higher compensation levels  provided in fiscal  years 1981  and 1982.  The combination of  bonuses and educational benefits available  to  enlistees, in addition to  the  pay, significantly helped the Army  to  reverse a  previously unfavor› able  situation. For  the  first  time  in  nearly a  decade, military pay approached a  level  comparable to  the private sector. With  the optimum result in  recruitment, the  Army  was in a position to  be selective  in  acquiring as well as in retaining soldiers. The  Army's continuing success in meeting near-term recruitment for  the  past two  years  enabled it  to  deny retention opportunities to  soldiers who  failed  to  measure up  to  Army standards.

The Army  was  dependent upon the  reserve components as well as the  active  force  for  Total  Army  mission  capability. Critical requirements for wartime combat support were  assigned to  re› serve  component units. They provided one-third of  the Total Army's  combat  divisions  and  approximately two-thirds of  its com› bat  support. The personnel status of  reserve component units, while  still  below  desired levels,  improved. The  Army's  manning goal  was  to  provide enough reserve component personnel to man  units  at  levels consistent with  readiness objectives.  The  Army planned to continue improving its reserve component unit strength through extensive reenlistment programs and by  re› cruitment of  quality soldiers who  would remain in the Army National Guard and the Army  Reserve. Toward this end, the Army  expanded the Full  Time Unit Support Program and ac› tively supported the  Selected Reserve  Incentive Program (SRIP). These initiatives were  designed to  provide full-time manning of both  early-deploying and  early-mobilizing-but-non-deploying re› serve  component units, and to  improve recruitment and  reten› tion  in  selected reserve component units  by  paying cash  bonuses and  giving  educational assistance.

The strength level  of  the pretrained individual manpower pool  of  the  reserve components remained unsatisfactory during the  year, but did  improve. Consisting of  the Individual Ready Reserve,  the  Inactive National Guard, the  Standby Reserve,  and military  retirees, this  pool  provided individual replacements for both  active  and  reserve component units  that  would  be  required in  wartime until the  training base  could provide replacements. This manpower pool  had a  shortfall of  some 100,000  enlisted personnel in  combat specialties, but  contained a  surplus of  sol› diers  in  several  noncombat military  specialties.  To  help  eliminate the  shortfall, bonus  funds  were  requested for  those  who  enlisted and reenlisted in  the Individual Ready Reserve. Additionally, the  Army  requested authority to  increase the  total  military ser› vice obligation from  six  years  to  eight.

Individual states  also  helped to  improve the  personnel status of  the reserve components. Thirty-two states provided educa› tional  assistance  and  other benefits to National Guard  personnel, and  Hawaii  extended benefits to selected  reservists. These  initia› tives assisted  in  solving  personnel acquisition and  retention prob› lems  in  the  reserve components.

Even  adequate strength levels  lose  some  of  their value  when units  suffer from  personnel turbulence, which  diminishes readi› ness  and  combat effectiveness. To  eliminate the  adverse impact of  turbulence in  the  active  force, the  Army  began  a  program of personnel stabilization and unit replacement under which  sol› diers train and  work together and are assigned as  a  unit both overseas  and  in  the  United States. After three years, Personnel will  form new  stabilized units, be  assigned to  other jobs, or  be released from  active  service,  as  appropriate.

The unit replacement system complements the American Regimental System  program, the first phase of  which was  re› cently  implemented. Composed of  battalions linked under one regimental flag,  or  "color," the  system  is based  on  paired battal› ions  serving in  the  continental United States  and  overseas. The regiment is  the community in  which a  soldier is  assigned and with  which  he  identifies throughout his  entire Army  career. Al› though it  is a  nontactical unit, the  regiment creates an  environ› ment that fosters cohesion and commitment while improving morale, training, and  readiness.

To  enable these  new  manning programs to  work, the  Army must make the maximum number of personnel available for service  in combat-related units  and  supporting activities . In  pur› suit  of this  objective, the  Army  implemented during the  past  two years a civilian hire  substitution program to replace  military  spaces

with  civilian  spaces where feasible. Civilian substitution freed soldiers  to perform their  combat  roles  while enhancing readiness by  increasing stability and expertise in  the Army's sustaining base.

The  Army  relied  heavily  on  its civilian work  force  of  391,000 dedicated men  and  women  to  perform tasks  necessary for  the daily operations of  the  three  uniformed components. These  tasks directly affected the readiness and war-fighting capability of America's  Total  Army.

Because  a well-trained, uniformed, and  professional civilian work  force  must  have  competent leadership to be most  effective, the  Army  focused  more  effort  on  leadership development. The Total  Army's  continuing goal  was to develop  leaders  at all levels who  possessed the highest ethical and professional standards and  who  were  committed to  mission  accomplishment and  to  the well-being  of  subordinates. Because  of  its critical  importance on the  modern battlefield, the fundamentals of  leadership were stressed  at all levels of  military  instruction. Courses  in ethics  and professionalism were  established at  all  commissioned officers schools  and  were  under development for  noncommissioned and warrant officers schools.

Excellence  in the  Total  Army  requires a strong  cadre  of  non› commissioned  officers  (NCO),  since the  NCOs  are  both  the  back› bone  of the  fighting units  and  the  first-line  trainers and  supervi› sors of new and junior soldiers.  Teaching the  NCO  corps  how  to lead,  train, and  teach  is therefore a  critical task.  Consequently, the  Army  put  increased emphasis on  providing leadership and technical training both at  schools  and in  field units. Believing that greater initiatives must be  taken by junior leaders if  the Army  is to be successful  in peace  and  war,  the  Army  encouraged a  command climate  which  reenforced basic  values  and  empow› ered  leaders at  all  levels  to  act  decisively  and  creatively. Person› nel  systems  were  aligned to  support unit  performance and  lead› ership  development at  the  lowest  levels. These efforts developed tomorrow's  leadership while  simultaneously improving  the  readi› ness  of  today's  Total Army.

## Active Military  Strength

The  active Army  entered fiscal year  1982 with  an  authorized strength of  780,300 men  and women. In February 1982,  the Army  asked  Congress to  increase the  end  strength to  784,000. During  June, however,  it became  apparent that  the  prospect for congressional approval of  the  increase was  not  favorable. Con-

tributing to  the  decision to  keep  the  end  strength at  780,300 was the  additional cost  associated with  unprogrammed growth  of  the actual  strength in  the  second quarter to  791,000. To  achieve  an end  strength of  780,300,  the  Army  implemented policies  empha› sizing  the  recruitment and  retention of  quality soldiers and  the discharge of  poor performers. As a result, the  overall quality  of the  force  was significantly  improved, and  the  active Army  reached an  end  strength of  780,391. On  10 September 1982,  only  twenty days  before the  end of  the fiscal  year, Congress raised the  end strength authorization to 782,500, too late for the Army to retarget the  actual end  strength.

Throughout fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  implemented a series of  personnel management and  strength policies  to  improve the quality of the force and to meet end strength and budget limitations. These policies enabled the Army to  raise its  stan› dards for  enlistment and reenlistment, to  assign "re-up" objec› tives  by  MOS, and to  reduce the migration rate of first-term soldiers in  the combat arms. With  the  availability of  day-to-day strength information, management capabilities within  the  Army have  been greatly enhanced.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  active  Army  force  structure was manned on  the  average at  101.4  percent of  authorizations, with an  average overmanning of 9,200  for  the  year.  On  30 September 1982,  active  Army strength was  as  follows:

|                                | Authorized Strength   | Actual Strength   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Officer ..................     | 103,100               | 103,109           |
| Enlisted Personnel ........... | 672,783               | 672,699           |
| U. S. Military Academy         | 4,417                 | 4,583             |
| Total                          | 780,300a              | 780,391           |

a An  end  strength of  782,500  was authorized on  10 September 1982,  too  late  to  program for  fiscal  year 1982.

## Enlisted  Personnel

Fiscal year  1982 was an  excellent recruiting year  for  the  Army in  terms of  both quality and  quantity of  accessions. As  in  fiscal year  1981,  the  Army  met  its programmed recruiting goals.  Army recruiters reached their fiscal  year 1982  objectives of 127,000 volunteers on  12 July 1982,  nearly three months before the  end of  the fiscal  year. The commanding general of  the U.S.  Army Recruiting Command stated that "the  service  was  more success› ful  in  attracting people this  year  than at  any  time  since  the  gov› ernment scrapped the  draft in  1973  in  favor  of  filling  its military

ranks  with  volunteers  .... Because  of  the  recruiting success,  the Army has stopped  enlisting  people  for  fiscal year  1982 and  started stockpiling for  fiscal  year 1983."

In fiscal year  1982, the  active Army  recruited a total of  130,198 men  and  women,  more  than  5,000  over  the  total  programmed objective  of  125,100,  and  104 percent of its objective.  Total  non› prior service (NPS) accessions  were  120,353  (104  percent of  the goal);  prior service  accessions were  9,845  (104  percent of  the goal).  Of  the non-prior service recruits, 103,571 (86  percent) were  high  school  diploma graduates, a 9.3-percent improvement over  fiscal  year 1981.Recruits in  mental category IV  numbered 23,121,  or  19.2  pecent, well below  the  25-percent ceiling  man› dated by  Congress and  an  improvement of  36.5  percent from fiscal  year 1981.

Recent success  in  Total Army  retention programs has  also resulted in  end  strengths that surpassed those  programmed for each  element of  the  active  Army  and  the  Selected  Reserve,  but  a significant shortage still existed in  the  Individual Ready  Reserve (IRR), which  is  the Army's pretrained manpower pool, and  in aviator strength. As  a  result of  both post-Vietnam War  force reductions and  the  end  of  the  draft, IRR strength declined from over  one  million  men  and  women  a decade  ago  to a low of under 150,000 in  1977. The  strength in fiscal year  1982 of about  213,000 was far  short of  the  453,800 required. Efforts were  being  made to  correct the  deficiency. Army  aviator strength was improving, and  the  Army's  warrant officer objective  should  be  reached dur› ing  fiscal  year 1983.  The  fiscal  year 1983 budget included funds to  increase the  number of  trained warrant officer aviators from 800  to  1,000.

While  general economic and  social  conditions have  been  sig› nificant factors in  the  notable improvement of  recruiting , other elements  also  contributed. These included higher pay,  expanded resources, better management, varied training assignment and enlistment options, enhanced educational benefits, and  growing public  support for  young men  and  women  in  uniform. The  Se› lected Reserve Incentive Program (enlistment-reenlistment bo› nuses and educational benefits) and the affiliation bonus pro› gram  especially  contributed to  success  in  the  reserve  components .

The 1980  Military Compensation Act  increased pay  by  an average of 14.3  percent in 1981  and made it  competitive with private sector pay  for the first time  since  the mid-l  970s.  This factor  contributed to  the  dramatic turnaround in  accession  and retention of  military personnel over  the  past  two  years.

Another important component of  the  recruiting package  was the enlistment bonus, a  highly flexible and efficient means of improving recruitment in critical  MOSs.  Enlistment bonuses  and the  skills for  which  they  were  offered could  be  easily  adjusted to reflect ever-changing supply and  demand, thereby allowing  the Army  to  react quickly to  recruiting problems that might arise because of  an  improved economy or  a  reduction in  the youth population. Provisions of  the Uniformed Service Act  of 1981 increased several special and incentive pays, raised the maxi › mum  enlisted bonus  from  $5,000  to  $8,000  for  four-year enlist› ments  and  set a $4,000  maximum for  three-year enlistments on a test  basis,  and improved travel and  transportation allowances.

The reenlistment bonus for the IRR was  tied to  skills  that were  expected to  be  in  short  supply  upon mobilization. It  author› ized  up  to  $900  for  three-year reenlistments. Contingency funds

for  the  Army  have  been  requested to produce an  estimated 20,000 three-year reenlistments in  the IRR.

To  manage recruiting more  efficiently, the  Army  undertook a  detailed and  intensive market research study  called  Recruiter Zone  Analysis. It  involved a  review of  demographics and  other significant factors of  the  market in  each  recruiting district. The analysis  considered variables such  as current population density of  seventeento  nineteen-year-olds, the  number and  location of high  schools,  unemployment, and  historical propensity to  enlist. Using  these  variables, the  Army  could make  the  best  use  of  re› cruiter strength and  location of  stations to  take  advantage of  the market. Under the Ultra Veterans Educational Assistance Pro› gram (Ultra VEAP),  nearly 4,700 soldiers enlisted for three or four years  in  one  of  sixty-two  qualifying specialties in  exchange for  benefits of  up  to  $20,100. Soldiers who  participated contrib› uted  up  to  $100  monthly to  receive full  benefits. To  qualify for Ultra VEAP,  a  soldier had to  have no  prior service; be  a  high school  diploma graduate; have  an  Armed Forces Qualification Test  score  of  50 or  more  and  be in  mental category I- IIIA; enlist for active duty; enroll in the Basic  VEAP for a  minimum of twelve  months; and  enlist  in  one  of  seventy-two selected military occupational specialties.

Reenlistment and recruitment programs of  the Army  were complementary: improved quality recruitment led  to  more and better qualified reenlistments. Among  the  many  changes under way in  personnel management that  brought about  improvements in recruitment and  reenlistment were  continued progress in qual› ity accessions; better alignment of  the  career force  with  noncom› missioned  officers (NCO);  filling  the  total  force  with  appropriate skills  in  the right grades; building stability and fostering cohe› sion  in  units; and  providing commanders with  increased author› ity  to  retain model soldiers and  to  eliminate ineffective ones.

In  th~  past,  soldiers with  more  than  eighteen years  of  service were,  almost  without exception, permitted to  reenlist or  extend their  enlistment to remain on  active  duty  until  they  reached their twenty-year retirement mark. However, a  clarification of  policy outlined in  interim change 16  to  AR  601-280, effective on 1 January 1982,  stated that major field commanders could deny this opportunity to  soldiers who  had bars to  reenlistment im› posed  or  approved by  the  Department of  the  Army (DA),  who had  refused to  take required action to  comply with  DA  assign› ment  instructions, or  who  did  not  meet  height and  weight  stan› dards of  AR  600-9. The  change also  denied reenlistment to  sol› diers  who  did  not  make  corporal or  specialist four during their

first three years of  service, but allowed privates first class  to extend their  overseas duty  long  enough to complete a tour,  and permitted extensions to  soldiers who  needed additional time  to satisfy a DA-imposed service  obligation. Another example  of the Army's  tougher standards was a  new  requirement that  reenlist› ing  soldiers have  three area  aptitude test  scores  of  95  or  better on  the  Armed Services  Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) Test.

Department of  the  Army  reenlistment objectives  for  the  first quarter of  fiscal  year 1982  were  transmitted to  the  major com› mands  in September 1981. These  objectives  represented a change from past practice in  that the Army  designated specific MOS objectives  for  initial-term soldiers (those  reenlisting for  the  first time),  midterm soldiers  (those  reenlisting for  the  second  or  subse› quent  time  up  to  ten  years  of  service),  and  careerists (those  with more  than ten  years  of  service). The MOS  reenlistment objec› tives were  part  of the  Army's  plan  to acquire  the  right  number of soldiers  with  the  appropriate qaulifications at  the  proper time.

The  Army  also used  reenlistment policies  to help  overcome a shortage of  6,000  noncommissioned officers in  selected  combat arms  skills as well as a shortage  of 2,400 NCOs  in other  specialties. This  was  accomplished by  allowing soldiers to  reenlist only  in their current skills  or in  shortage skills.  Selective reenlistment bonuses for  critical  skills  assisted in  this  process, as  did  the  fact that  opportunities for  promotion were  higher  in skills with greater shortages .

A  total  of  87,184 men  and  women reenlisted in  fiscal  year 1982.  This  was  1,494  more  than had  been  expected when  goals were  set  for the fiscal year. Significantly, reenlistments were higher than  expected in  the  combat  branches of infantry, armor, and  artillery,  where the  Army  has  experienced chronic difficul› ties  since  the  end  of  the  draft nearly  a decade  ago.  Active  Army reenlistment achievements for  fiscal  year 1982  were  as  follows:

|              | Achiev ed   |   Percent of Goal |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Initial Term | 34,01 l     |              96.6 |
| Midterm .    | 28,553      |              94.2 |
| Career . .   | 21,645      |             107.2 |
| Total .      | 84,209      |              98.3 |

Effective 1 April 1982  the  Army  changed its policies  to expe› dite  the  separation of  "marginal performers." Commanders were now  able  to  discharge marginal performers under the  Expedi› tious  Discharge Program (Chapter 5, AR  635-200) without the

soldier's  consent. Commanders could  also discharge soldiers  with less  than six  years' service involuntarily and without offering them  a  board of  officers to  consider the  matter. These changes implemented Department of  Defense policies  which  permitted the identification and separation of  individuals who  had not adapted to  military service.  Soldiers separated under the  revised policies  would  receive  either an  honorable or  general discharge.

A close  look  at  the  data  pertaining to  the  three-year attrition rates in  the active  Army indicates two  key  factors influencing attrition: one  was related to the  quality  of accessions  (educational levels  of  the  recruits) and  the  other to  sex.  As  indicated by  the figures in Table 2, rates for soldiers who  were  high school  di› ploma  graduates (HSDGs)  tended to  be  lower  than those  of  sol› diers  who  did  not  graduate. AFQT  categories within  the  educa› tion  group were  also  factors influencing attrition, mainly  during the  training periods. For  instance, high  school  diploma gradu› ates  who  were  classified as  AFQT mental category IV  normally had higher attrition during training than the high school di› ploma  graduates in  mental categories 1-IIIA.

Through fiscal  year 1978,  attrition rates for male  recruits decreased considerably, largely because of  the Army's intensi› fied  efforts to  increase accessions  from  groups with  lower  risk  of attrition and  reduce  accessions  from  higher  risk groups. However, quantitative recruiting efforts to  meet manpower requirements during the  period resulted in  slight increases in  the three-year attrition rates for  fiscal  year 1979  through 1980.

The  three-year attrition rate  of  first-term female  soldiers  re› cruited since  fiscal  year 1979  is  approximately 15-20 percent higher than that of  their male  counterparts and  has  increased considerably among the  recruits of  fiscal  year 1980,  largely  be› cause many of these recruits were not high school diploma graduates.

After extensive staffing and  coordination, a  complete revi› sion of AR 570-4  "Army  Management," was published  in Septem› ber 1982  with  an  effective date  of  15 October 1982.  Highlights of the  changes in  the  regulations included definition of authori› ties  delegated to  MACOM  (Major  Army  Command) command› ers  and those reserved for Headquarters, Department of  the Army (HQDA); definition of  borrowed military manpower (BMM) and  updated policies;  new  controls  for  unscheduled over› time  that  were  realistic  and  auditable; improved position  identi› fication policies;  and procedures for  submission and  coordina› tion  of  TDA  (tables  of  distribution and  allowances)  changes re› quiring HQDA  approval.

A readiness problem encountered by the  Army  in  past  years was using  soldiers  from  tactical  units  to  perform base  operations and  installation support functiops instead of  civilians  because  of a constrained civilian  manpower authorization. Borrowing mili› tary manpower had an adverse effect on  personnel and unit readiness and  decreased job satisfaction. In recognition of  this impact  Congress authorized the  Army  an  increase  of  6,500  civil› ians in fiscal year  1981 and  10,300  in  fiscal year  1982-a total  of 16,800-to replace borrowed military manpower and improve near-term readiness .  By  the end  of 1981  about 6,000  civilians were hired,  and  a total  of  1,100 noncommissioned officers  (NCOs) and  4,300 other soldiers were  returned to  their units .  During fiscal  year 1982,  another 6,000  civilians  were  hired with  a  con› comitant return of  enlisted men  and  women  to  their soldiering duties.

## Officer Personnel

In  fiscal year  1982 the  Army's  officer  program achieved  nota› ble success.  The  officer  strength of the  active  Army  continued to increase, rising from 101,850  to  103,463  during the  year.  The following  table  breaks down  the  officer end  strength by  grade.

aTh is figure includes  354  reimbursable active  duty  personn el;  otherwise tota l is  103,109 .

Most  of  the  increase in  strength during the past year  was among  officers  with  more than four years  of  service,  reflecting improved retention. Although the  number of  senior active  duty officers was  growing at  a  slower  rate than the  total number of officers,  the  average  grade among  active  Army  officers  remained unchanged for  two  years  at  roughly 0-3  (captain). This  meant that  officers had  more  years  of  service  in  grade.

The  growth in  officer strength did  not  offset the  increased operational demand for  another 1,871  officers and  the  Army's need  to  have  13,437  officers  either attending military  or  civilian schools  or  in  transit to  new  assignments.

Early  in  fiscal  year 1982,  the Department of  Defense pro› posed  management reform legislation  for  general (and  flag) offi› cers  in response to a congressional request for  accountability and validation of  star-rank positions. This represented DOD's  first attempt  since the  Officer  Grade  Limitation  Act of  1954 to stream› line  service  procedures for  determining numbers, assignments, and  qualifications of  general (and  flag)  officers . Key  provisions in  the  proposed legislation  would  create  uniform system  account› ing  for  general (and  flag)  offic er requirements; new grade  tables and  a  revised method of  determining general (and  flag)  officer ceilings  based  on  force stru cture and  size,  with  special  support requirem ents  counted separately ; a  standardized system  for  all services in  reviewing, validating, and reporting on  star-billet requirements; and  clearl y defined authority within  DOD  to con-

trol  general (and  flag)  officers. The  proposal would  exclude the minimum grade requirements on  general (and  flag)  officers as› signed  to  the  reserve components and  the Judge Advocate Gen› eral  Corps.

The  recruitment and  retention of  medical  personnel, a persis› tent  problem area  in the  officer  corps,  steadily  improved in  fiscal year 1982.  The Army's recruitment and retention efforts ex› ceeded  by  about one  hundred the  number of  active  duty  Army Medical  Department officers  authorized in 1982-16,532 (actual strength) as  compared with  16,438  (authorized strength).

Although shortages in several specialties eased, the  number of officers  in  the  Dental  Corps,  Medical  Service  Corps,  and  Army Medical  Specialist  Corps  fell slightly  short  of the  minimum peace› time  requirements. (Table  4)

As a  result of  current initiatives, Army  Medical  Department officer strength in  the Army  Reserve was  expected to  increase significantly. Nonetheless, Army  Reserve  Troop Program units were  still  55  percent short of  physicians and  28.5  percent short of  nurse needed upon mobilization. Critical shortages also  re› mained in  surgical specialties.

A joint recruiting effort by the  Army  Surgeon General's Of› fice  and  the  Army  Reserve has  been  in  progress since  late  fiscal year 1980.  It  produced 656  physicians in fiscal  year 1981  and 550  physicians in fiscal  year 1982;  it  was  projected to  produce 450  physicians in  fiscal  year 1983  and annually thereafter for troop program units.

Active duty  officer  accessions  totaled  9,417  in  fiscal year  1982. Of  these,  3,998  men  and  women  came  from  the  Reserve  Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), 885  from the United States Military Academy (USMA),  770  from Officer Candidate School  (OCS), and  3,764  from  other sources, including 1,633 warrant officers.

In  addition, 8,486  officers  entered the  Army  Reserve,  and  6,058 officers received Army  National Guard appointments. (Table 5)

On  15 March 1982 the  Precommissioning Branch of  the  Of› fice of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel became  the  Offi› cer  Accession  Branch and  assumed responsibility for  Total  Army officer procurement from  all  sources.

Future officer accessions were  based  on  several  projections. The  ROTC  production should reach the 10,500  range in  1985. Approximately 5,000  officers would  be  brought to  active  duty; the  remainder would  be  reserve component accessions. Begin› ning  in 1985  the majority of  ROTC duty accessions would  be scholarship recipients. The  number of  those  commissioned early and  brought to  active  duty  beginning in  1985 would  be  between 400 and  600.  Beginning in school  year  1983-1984 12,000 ROTC scholarships would  be funded for  award. It  was estimated that  by 1985  the  ROTC Scholarship Program would  yield  about 3,500 officers. All  graduate delay  students would  be  brought to  active duty after obtaining advanced degrees. USMA  output would remain  at approximately 900  per  year.  Beginning in  1986, active OCS  would  be  reduced to  an  annual output of  550.  Within the voluntary active duty program (selective recall, volunteers for active  duty, and Commandants Program), selective and invita› tional recall should remain in the 500  range. Direct appoint› ments in the special branches would be  stable, while  warrant officer strength would increase by  201  and 487  in  fiscal  years 1983 and  1984, respectively.

Officer accessions in  the  reserve components rose  as  ROTC production increased. In  fiscal year  1982, ROTC  accessions  made up  22  percent of  reserve component accessions. By  fiscal  year 1988, 44 percent of  reserve  component accessions  would  be  from ROTC, and in  the future years as  many non-graduate ROTC commissionees as  possible would be  assigned to the reserve

components. As  a  result, there would  be  a  corresponding de› crease  in  the  accessioning of  officers in  the  reserve components from  the  state  OCS  program.

The  Army  Medical  Department active  duty  accessions  in  fis› cal year 1982  were  met,  with  the  exception of  two  Medical  Ser› vice Corps  specialties:  sanitary  engineering and  nuclear  medicine. Emphasis shifted from  recruiting volunteer physicians to  filling vacancies  at  the  community hospital  level and  accessioning hard› to-get  specialists.  Medical  center assignments for  volunteer physi› cians  were  restricted to  certain critical  specialties, while  recruit › ment  counselors emphasized the  search for  qualified physicians to  fill the  ranks of  the  post  hospital staffs.  Although there was a decrease in  the number of  volunteer physicians (164  in  fiscal year 1982  compared with  259  in  fiscal  year 1981,  332  in  1979, and  326  in  1978),  this  group still constituted 28  percent of  total Medical  Corps entries on  active  duty for  fiscal  year 1982.  Im› proved physician retention and anticipated increases in  acces› sions from  other  sources,  such  as Health  Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences  (USUHS),  will offset  the  projected reduction in the  Medical  Corps  volunteer program.

Twelve  universities were  added to  the  list  of  Army ROTC host  institutions which  had  an  Army  ROTC detachment physi› cally located  on  their  campus. This  increase  brought the  count  of host  institutions to  315.  The number of  universities and  colleges at  which ROTC  was  available to  students grew  to  over 1,400. This  included extension centers that  were  staffed by ROTC  de› tachments on  campuses close  by,  in  the  host  institutions, and  at cross-enrolled schools,  which  had  students academically  enrolled who  attended ROTC instruction at  other schools. The twelve universities added to  the list  of host institutions were  Embry› Riddle  Aeronautical University, Duke  University, University of South  Maine,  Memphis  State  University, University  of  Louisville, Winona  State  University, University of  New  Orleans, University of Texas  at San  Antonio, University  of Alabama  at Birmingham, Northern Arizona University, Boise  State  University, and  Cali› fornia State  University at  Fresno.

School  year  1981- 1982 was the  first  year  for  allocation  of ten two-year  scholarships  at each  of six military junior colleges  (MJC): Kemper  Military  School  and  College,  Wentworth Military  Acad› emy  and  Junior College, New  Mexico  Military  Institute, Valley Forge Military Academy and  Junior College, Marion Military Institute, and  Georgia  Military  College.  The  allocation  and  award of  these  scholarships was  in  compliance with  10 USC  2107.

During  fiscal year  1982, the  Army  experienced chronic  short› ages  of  field  grade officers managed under the  Officer Person› nel  Management System  (OPMS).  These were the officers as› signed  to a control  branch or  specialties  other than  the  Chaplain's Corps,  Judge Advocate General's Corps, Medical  Corps, Army Medical  Specialist  Corps, Medical  Service  Corps, Dental  Corps, Veterinary Corps, and  Army  Nurse Corps.

To  alleviate  the  shortage of  approximately 4,600  field  grade officers  needed to fill authorized duty  positions  and  remain  within the  Defense  Officer Personnel Management Act  (DOPMA)  con› straints, the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Personnel developed a plan to align the Army officer personnel inventory with its authorized duty positions in  the field grade ranks. Designated as Force  Alignment II,  the  plan  would  replace 3,600  field  grade positions  with  company grade positions and  an  additional 1,000 field  grade positions with  civilian  positions. When  fully  imple› mented by  fiscal  year 1984,  Force Alignment II would  enable the Army to  eliminate chronic officer shortages in  the fieid grade ranks.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  reached its  goal  of  filling medical  and  health service  personnel positions that  had  been  in critical  shortage during the  post-Vietnam War  period. Conse› quently, the  Army  Medical  Department (AMEDD)  was in a posi› tion to be  selective with all  of the health professionals it re› cruited .  In general, except for some  critically needed surgical subspecialties, the Army's physician shortage was  over.  There was concern, however,  about  the  effect  that  the  recently enacted (DOPMA)  would  have  on  bringing certified health professionals into the  Army. Previously, physicians and dentists were  given four years of  pay credit for formal education (postbachelors degree), but  DOPMA  erased that; consequently, entry salaries for  physicians and  dentists were  cut  in  some  cases  by  as  much as $4,000.

In  order to provide the  armed forces  with  an  officer  manage› ment  policy  that  was uniform, equitable, and  tailored to contem › porary  manpower requirements, the  Department of  Defense  and Congress  in fiscal year  1981 agreed, after sixteen  years  of effort, on  the  DOPMA.  Congress passed  it on  2 1 November 1980,  the President signed  it on  12 December 1980, and  it wertt into  effect on  15 September 1981.  Although DOPMA  affected all commis› sioned officers, including generals, its primary impact would be to create  a single  promotion system  for  all field  grade  officers on  active  duty and  eventually to  produce an  active  Army  field grade officer corps that is  all  Regular Army.  The new  system would  replace the  old  dual  system  of  permanent Regular Army

(RA)  ranks and temporary Army  of  the  United States (AUS) ranks, as  well  as  an  active  Army corps of  field grade officers that, since  the  Vietnam War,  has  consisted of  about 7  percent Other Than Regular Army  (OTRA)  officers.

Following  enactment of  DOPMA,  the  Secretary of  the  Army approved the  establishment of  promotion competitive categories in  October 1981.  The nine categories (JAG  Corps, Chaplain Corps,  Medical  Corps,  Dental  Corps,  Army  Nurse  Corps,  Medi› cal  Service Corps, Veterinary Corps, Army  Medical Specialist Corps,  and  Army  Competitive Category) served as  the  founda› tion  upon which  the  Army's  officer personnel management sys› tem  was  built.

The Army  established an  active  duty list  (ADL)  containing the  names of  Regular Army  and  eligible  reserve officers from which  new  active  duty promotions would  be  made. Promotion resulting from  an  ADL  board was  permanent for  both regular and  reserve  officers . During fiscal  year 1982, the  grade  in which officers were  serving on  active  duty  on 15 September 1981  be› came  their permanent grade.

The first ADL  promotion selection boards were  conducted for  grades of  captain through colonel during fiscal  year 1982. While  the up-or-out provisions of  the old promotion system remained, there were  some  important differences. Previously a Regular  Army  major  was guaranteed service  until  about  twenty› one  years the  time  required for  two  nonselections to lieutenant colonel.  Since ADL  promotions were  permanent, the  time  needed to be passed over twice for promotion to a  Regular Army lieutenant-colonel was  reduced to  about seventeen years .  The RA officer's  only  guarantee of  reaching and  going  beyond  retire› ment  under the  new  law was to be promoted to lieutenant colonel.

To accommodat e the  move toward an all- regular  officer  corps, the  maximum  allowable  Regular  Army  officer  force  was increased from  49,500  to  63,000.  The  Secretary of  the  Army  approved an all-regular field  grade  force  with  promotion to major  as the break point  for  Regular  Army  integration. This  action  would  be accom › plished in phases and affected officers in three categories differently. First,  reser ve  officers on  active  duty  on  15 Septem › ber 1981  select ed  for  or  serving in  grades of  major and  above were  administratively offered RA integration if  they  met  certain basic  criteria. If they elected to  continue service as  a  reserve officer,  they  would  be  released from  active  duty  at  twenty  years. Second , reserve officers on  active  dut y  on 15  September 1981 serving in  the  comp any  grades would  automatically be  offered RA  integration when  select ed  for  promotion to  major. These

officers also  could  reject  integration and  could  serve  until  they were  eligible  for  retirement after  twenty  years,  if they  so desired. Finally,  reserve  officers  commissioned after 1 October 1981 who were  selected  for  promotion to  major  had  to  accept  RA integra› tion  or leave  active duty.  Those  electing  not  to become  RA would leave active duty  voluntarily  and  would  not  be eligible for  separa› tion  pay.

A revision  of Army  Regulation 600-101, approved in August 1981 and  effective  on  1 October 1981,  transferred to the  various Army  schools  primary responsibility for  setting  educational and skill standards for  commissioned officer  specialty  codes,  warrant officer  military  occupational specialties,  and  enlisted  career  man› agement fields.  The proponent schools  advised  and  assisted  the Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel and  the  Mili› tary  Personnel Center in  developing and  carrying  out  personnel management policies  and  programs and  in  operating personnel systems  within the purview of  their specialty interest and re› sponsibility. The schools dealt with  their specialties only  in  a collective sense  and  did  not  have  authority over  decisions  regard› ing  individuals, which  were  normally handled by  the Military Personnel Center  or  commanders of reserve  component person› nel  agencies.

The  Army  also  instituted changes in  the  specialty  classifica› tion  system  for  commissioned officers. Effective 1 March 1982 the  engineer specialty career field was  revised to  improve de› scriptions  of duty,  function, and  responsibility. Significant  in this revision was  the creation of  Specialty Code 22,  Topographic Engineer, formally a  skill  identifier within Specialty Code  21, Engineer. Specialty  Code 31,  Law  Enforcement, was  renamed Military  Police.

Effective 1 September 1982,  the  operations specialty  career field  was also improved. Significant  in this revision  was the  elimi› nation  of the  training  development specialty career  field (formerly Specialty  Code  28)  and  inclusion of  these functions within  the operations specialty  career field.  Also  included in  the  newly  de› fined  operations specialty  career field  was the  manpower-force management function (formerly an  additional skill  identifier). The title  of  the operations specialty career field was  changed from  Specialty  Code  54,  Operations and  Force  Development, to Specialty Code 54, Operations, Plans, Training, and Force Development.

On  15 September 1982,  a  new  concept was approved which would  result  in a separate career  management system  for  special operations personnel. The new  system  would  include commis-

sioned officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. The system  principally encompassed personnel who  had  been for› merly  classified in  unconventional warfare skill  identifiers. Ac› tion  was  under way  through a  working group to  carry out  this decision.

## Women in the Army

In  the  Army  women  are  authorized to  serve  in  92  percent of all officer, warrant officer, and  enlisted specialties. Women  may be assigned  to all units  except  battalion and  smaller-sized units  of infantry, armor, cannon field artillery, low-altitude air  defense artillery, combat engineers, and  certain aviation units.

Approximately 10  percent of  the active Army  was  female, while  the  female share of  Army National Guard and  Army  Re› serve  troop units was  approximately 5  percent and 16 percent, respectively. In February 1981,  the active Army  announced a decision  to  pause at  a  level  of  65,000 enlisted women  pending a review  of  policies and programs on  the role of  women. The Army's  criteria, as  in  all  personnel management reviews,  would be  used  to  improve combat readiness and  enhance mobilization capability. Initial  assessment of  this  review  indicated that  further analysis  would  be  needed through 1982  and 1983.

As  of  30  September 1982,  more than 144,000  women  were serving  in  the  Total Army:  75,000  in  the  active  force, 20,000 in the  National Guard, 34,000 in  Army Reserve troop units, and 15,600  in  the  Individual Ready  Reserve.

In January 1982,  the  Secretary of  Defense directed the  mili› tary  services  to  "aggressively break down  those  remaining barri› ers  that  prevent us  from  making the  fullest  use  of the  capabilities of  women in providing for our national defense." Secretary Weinberger's memorandum to  the  service  secretaries affirming the  administration's policy  to expand the  role  of  military  women was  a  strong, positive statement in  an  otherwise uncertain year for  women  in  the  Army.

In  May  1982,  the  Army  announced that  it would  discontinue coeducational basic  training by  September, because men  were not  being challenged enough physically in  integrated training companies and  were  not  attaining their full  potential. The  effec› tive  date of  the new  policy  was  later changed to  October 1982. Although basic  training would  remain the  same  for  both sexes, male  and female recruits would be  separated at the company level  and below .  Men and women had been training in  inte› grated  companies since  1978.  Training cadre  assignments would

continue to  be  made regardless of  gender, with  female  drill  in› structors training men  as well as women.  Under the  new  system, female  recruits would  receive  basic training only  at  Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Dix, New  Jersey; and Fort McClellan, Alabama .

Many  women  leaders considered the  decision to  end coed basic  training a  step backward. Army spokesmen, however, insisted  that  it was  not  meant to  discriminate against  women  but to  toughen the  men.

During fiscal  year 1982  women  were  also  concerned about delays  in  completing the  review  of  current Army  policies  affect› ing women,  which  began  in May  1981. The  Women  in the  Army Policy Review  Group finally  completed its study  in  August 1982 and  submitted its  report through appropriate staff  channels to the Secretary of  the Army. By  the end of  the fiscal  year the report still had  not  been  published, although some  of the  review group's findings were  released, stirring up  considerable contro› versy  over  the  future role  of  female soldiers.

On 26 August 1982, the  Secretary of Defense  announced the decision,  based  on  the  policy  review,  to  increase the  number of enlisted  women  in the  Army  over  the  next  five years  from  65,000 to  70,000.  This  figure  was well below  the  goal of  87,500  enlisted women  set  by  the  Carter administration. At  the  same  time,  the Army  announced that,  as a result  of  the  review  group's clarifica› tion  of  the  combat exclusion policy,  an  additional twenty-three military occupational specialties would be  closed to  women. Furthermore, new  physical  strength standards and  tests  would probably bar  most  women from many  other  jobs  in  the  Army. Administration officials maintained that those changes would help  rather than hinder women  by  assigning them to jobs for which  they  are  better suited.

## Equal  Opportunity and Minority  Representation

Equal  opportunity is a program concerned with  human  devel› opment  that  allows talent,  ability, and  initiative  to flourish  through fair  and  impartial treatment. Equal  opportunity programs help commanders and  managers create an  environment free  of  dis› crimination in  any  form one  that  is conducive to  cohesion and mission  accomplishment.

The  Department of  the  Army  Affirmative Action  Plan  pro› vided  a direct  link  between the  efforts of  the  Department of  the Army  and  the  major  commands to achieve  equal  opportunity for all  military personnel and  their families . Recent assessment re-

ports  indicated that progress toward fiscal  ye· ar 1982  goals  had been  favorable concerning women  and  minority enrollment in officer commissioning programs, promotions, command selec› tions,  career schooling, and  other career development areas.

As of 30 September 1982,  3  7.4  percent of active  duty  person› nel  were  members of  minorities (29.4  percent black,  3.9  percent Hispanic,  and  4.1  percent others). Blacks  made  up  8.8 percent of commissioned officers, 6.2  percent of warrant officers, and  32.6 percent of  the enlisted force. (Table 6)  There remained a  ten› dency  for  blacks  to  be  even  more heavily  represented in  certain enlisted career management fields that characteristically have had  large numbers of  blacks-supply petroleum handler and food  service.

1 This  is minority  representation data  only.  Data  may be different from  racial data  because  white and  black informa› tion  excludes  all  Hispanics.

A  presidential task  force on  military manpower concluded that the high propensity of  blacks enlisting and reenlisting in recent  years  was based  on  "the  proud heritage of Black service  in the  military  since  the  beginnings of the  nation,  which  has contrib› uted strongly to the prestige of  military service in the Black community," and "the fact that military service offers Blacks better opportunities for  responsible work  at  fair  compensation than  are  available  to them  in many  segments  of the  private  sector."

The  objective of  the  civilian  equal employment opportunity program was to ensure a working force  reflective of  the  nation's diversity  in all occupations, grade  levels, and  employment benefits.

For  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  developed an  affirmative ac› tion  plan  for  evaluating civilian job categories to  determine the representation of  minority group members and  women.  Where groups were underrepresented in  the Army  work  force, they were  targeted for  increased placement efforts.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army achieved eight of  its  ten goals  for the employment and advancement of  minorities and women  in  the  civilian  work  force. The  total  of  minority person› nel  in  full-time, permanent, appropriated fund positions in› creased from  59,233  (19.3  percent) to  65,004  (20.3  percent) and the  number of  women from 115,989  (37.7  percent) to  124,374 (38.8  percent). In  grades GS----13  nd  above,  minorities a rose  from 1,366 (6.4 percent) to  1,501  (6.8  percent) and  women  from  1,012 (4.8 percent) to  1,167  (5.3  percent). On  30 September 1982 there were  15 members of  minority groups and  7 women  among the 317 filled  positions in  the  Army's  Senior  Executive Service  (SES), compared with  10 minority group members and  4 women  out  of 292  filled  SES  positions on  30  September 1981.

Another equal  opportunity program the  Army  used  with  suc› cess  was  the Severely Handicapped Affirmative Requirement Program (SHARP). The  purpose of  this  program was to increase the number of handicapped employees, including disabled veterans, with special emphasis on individuals with severe handicaps. Accessions for the eighteen-month period from 1 October 1979  to  31  March 1981  were 116,540; of  these, 451 or  .39 percent were  severely  handicapped. Between 1 April 1981 and  30  September 1981,  307  of  37,887  accessions  or  .81  percent

were  severely  handicapped individuals. As of 30 September 1982, 6  percent of  the Army's work force was  made up  of  disabled veterans, including 1 percent who  were 30  percent or more disabled.

An  area  of  continuing concern was  the  evidence or  percep› tion  of  sexual harassment. As  part of  the Armywide effort to combat sexual harassment, special training programs for mili› tary  and  civilian  personnel, both  male  and  female, were  begun. During fiscal  year 1982,  the  U.S.  Army  Training and  Doctrine Command developed standardized training to  counter sexual harassment for  use  in  all enlisted and  officer service  schools  and in  ROTC  courses.  The  Army  also  produced standard, high  qual› ity training programs on  the  prevention of  sexual  harassment to present to  civilian employees and their supervisors. Finally, a revised  Army  Regulation 600-21, "Equal  Opportunity Program in  the Army," which explicitly defines sexual harassment and prohibits it  in  the Army, was  prepared for publication during fiscal  year 1983.

## Alcohol and  Drug  Abuse

The Army  considered alcohol and drug abuse a  readiness issue  and a  command problem. Commanders focused on  the impact  of  abuse  on  the  readiness of  both units  and  individuals. The  Army  acted  to eliminate drug pushers from  its ranks. It  also tried to  rehabilitate abusers; those who  could not be  rehabili› tated  were  separated from the  Army.

The  Army  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention and  Control Program (ADAPCP) provided alcohol and other drug abuse identification, treatment, and  rehabilitation for  active  duty  mili› tary  personnel, civilian  employees, family  members, and  Army National Guard and Army Reserve personnel on  active  duty. The 1,984  military and civilian personnel associated with  the program staffed 3  residential treatment centers, 5  USAREUR extended care  facilities, and 179  counseling centers. Each  year, the  ADAPCP  returns to  duty  approximately 19,000  soldiers, the equivalent of  a  reinforced division. About 3,000 rehabilitation failures are  separated annually. Recent  success  in  recruiting and retaining more  high  quality  soldiers  enabled  the  Army  to toughen its standards on  alcohol  and  other drug abuse  during fiscal  year 1982.

In  a complete revision  of  Army  Regulation 600-85, "Alcohol and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention and  Control Program," effective 1 January 1982,  the  Army  updated its  policies  in  this  area. At  the

same  time,  senior  leaders began  a concerted effort to reduce the adverse effects of  alcohol and other drug abuse on  soldier proficiency, morale, and combat effectiveness. Marijuana and alcohol,  the  most  heavily  abused  substances among  younger ser› vice  members, became key  targets in the overall program to toughen standards and  reduce substance abuse.

The revised regulation introduced a  three-track system  of treatment for  soldiers  exhibiting varying  degrees  of involvement with  drugs and alcohol. Track I  provided education in  short› term  awareness  for  persons displaying limited  involvement with drugs , particularly marijuana . Aimed  at the occasional  or experi› mental  abuser,  it emphasized the  adverse  physical,  psychological, and  career consequences that  could occur  as  a  result of  abuse. Track II, designed for individuals with  more profound abuse patterns, provided a  variety of  outpatient counseling services. Track III provided intensive short-term residential treatment, followed  by supportive outpatient programs for  a period of  one year.

Soldiers  enrolled in rehabilitation programs were  expected to show individual initiative and  steady  progress in  overcoming al› cohol  and drug-related problems. Commanders closely  moni› tored  their  progress  through consultation with ADAPCP  rehabili› tation teams. If  it  became apparent that an  individual was  not responding, the  commander could  separate the  soldier  from  the service after  ninety  days of treatment. Those  who failed  rehabili› tation could receive honorable or general discharges, as  war› ranted by their  military records.

As a further crackdown on  marijuana and  other  drugs,  com› manders who  had probable cause to  believe that members of their  units  were  using  drugs could  direct that  urinalysis testing be  conducted on  any  of  them. Positive  lab  results from these specimens  could  be  used  as evidence in judicial and  administra› tive  procedures.

Other  initiatives  included increased awareness  through educa› tion,  a  program to  upgrade counselor skills, better program as› sessment  through expanded management information, and  im› proved  identification capabilities  by using  portable  testing devices. Positive  support to  provide wholesome  alternatives to drugs  and alcohol,  such  as  physical  fitness  centers, better living  and  work› ing  conditions, and  improved morale  and  welfare  activities,  was essential to  achieve the Army's goal  of  reducing alcohol and drug  abuse  among  soldiers.

## Discipline, Law  Enforcement,  and Military justice

Although it  was  difficult to  measure discipline in  the  Army with  precision, statistics  on  certain infractions and  punishments gave  a  useful insight into trends in  the discipline of  the force. Table 7  compares indiscipline indicators for fiscal years 197  4 through 1982.  This  year's  indiscipline rates  were  below  those  of fiscal  year 1981  in  all  but one category-drug offenses other than use  and possession of  marijuana, which  registered a  slight increase of  less  than 1 percent. More  important, discipline has improved significantly in  all categories since  the  inception of  the all-volunteer force,  with  particularly impressive results in  deser› tion  and  absences without leave.

In fiscal year 1982  absenteeism was  at  the lowest level  in recent history. The desertion rate of 11 per thousand was  the lowest  since  1962, and  the  AWOL  rate  of  27.3  per  thousand was the  lowest  since  the  Army began recording AWOL  data  regu› larly  in  1952.  Factors  contributing to  the  favorable rates  included better quality  of  men  and  women  entering the  Army,  command emphasis on  preventing absenteeism through leadership, and increased unit  cohesion.

The number of court-martial cases also decreased, from 10,438 in fiscal year  1981 to 9,856  in fiscal year  1982. The  break› down  of court-martial statistics  for  fiscal year  1982 was as follows:

|                 | Convicted   |   Acquitted | Total   |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| General ......  | 1,387       |         113 | 1,500   |
| BCD/SPCM•       | 2,411       |         145 | 2,556   |
| Special ....... | 1,480       |         169 | 1,649   |
| Summary         | 3,822       |         329 | 4,151   |
| Total           | 9,100       |         756 | 9,856   |

a Special  courts-martial involving  bad  conduct discharges.

Nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code  of  Mili› tary Justice,  was imposed  in  140,191 cases, compared with  156,497 cases  in  fiscal  year 1981.

During fiscal  year 1982  significant changes were made in Army  regulations on military justice, the Manual for Courts› Martial, and the Uniform Code  of  Military  Justice. Public  Law 97-81  amended the  Uniform Code  of Military Justice (UCMJ)  so that  commanders could place  on  involuntary excess  leave  those service  members who  had  received  a punitive  discharge and  were awaiting appellate review of  their court-martial. The law  also placed  a two-year  statute of  limitation on  petitions to  The  Judge Advocate General for  review  under Article  69,  UCMJ,  and  per› mitted  service  secretaries to define, by regulation, the  reasonable availability  of  individually requested military counsel.

Executive  Orders 12340  and 12383,  signed  20 January 1982 and  23  September 1982,  respectively, amended the  Manual  for Courts-Martial. Executive Order 12340  changed the  standards and procedures for acting on  requests for individual military counsel,  for  dealing  with  prisoners after  trial,  for  serving  Courts of  Military  Review decisions  and  petitions  for  review  to the  Court of Military Appeals,  and  for  submitting applications  to The  Judge Advocate  General under Article  69,  UCMJ.  These changes im› plemented the  Military  Justice Amendments of  1981.  Executive Order 12383 changed the  pleading, proof, and  punishment for controlled substances  and  drug  offenses;  defined the  offenses  of distribution and  possession  with  intent to  distribute; and  gener› ally increased maximum punishments for  drug offenses, except for  off-duty possession  and  use  of less than  thirty  grams  of  mari› juana or  certain other drugs  having  a relatively  low potential for abuse. These were specifically defined as  schedule IV  and V controlled  substances  in Section  812, Title  21, United  States Code.

A revision  of Army  Regulation 27-10, "Military Justice," was published on  1 September 1982  with  an  effective  date  of  1 No› vember  1982. It incorporated twenty-one  permanent and  numer› ous interim  changes  to the  1968 edition  of the  regulation. Major changes  were  made  in  the  administration of  nonjudicial punish› ment  and  the  filing  of  related records in  the  official  personnel file  of  the  service  member.

Proceedings under Article 15,  Uniform Code of  Military Justice, were  now  divided  into  formal  and  summarized versions, allowing  commanders more  flexibility  in  dealing with  minor  of› fenders and  enabling them  to dispose  of minor  infractions more quickly.  The new,  summarized Article 15 carried a  maximum punishment of extra  duty  for  fourteen days,  restriction for  four› teen  days,  an  oral  reprimand or  admonition, or  any  combination thereof. These  proceedings would  not  become  a permanent part of the  soldier's  official  military  personnel file.  Instead, records  of summarized Article 15s would  be maintained in  the  unit  person› nel  files  for  two  years  after the  date  of  punishment or  until the soldier transferred to  another unit, whichever came  first. Re› cords of formal Article 15s,  however, would be  kept in  the individual's official  file  either in  the performance or  restricted portion, at the discretion of the commander imposing the punishment. Under certain conditions, commissioned officers, warrant  officers,  and  enlisted  personnel in grades  E-6  and  above could  petition the  Department of  the  Army  Suitability Evalua› tion  Board to  transfer records of  nonjudicial punishment from the  performance to  the  restricted portion of  the  personnel file.

The  revised  regulation on  military  justice also provided for  more direct involvement of  senior noncommissioned officers in  the nonjudicial punishment process.

The prisoner population in the Army  correctional system reached a low of  1,661  (1,531  Army)  in  February 1978, but  then began  to increase  steadily,  reaching a high  of 3,124  (2,804 Army) in July 1981.  During fiscal  year 1982  the  number of  prisoners remained high, and by  the end of  the year some  stabilization became  apparant. On  30 September 1982, there  were  2,994  pris› oners in  Army confinement facilities, including 2,559 Army personnel. The high  number of  Army  prisoners was  attributed to tougher treatment of offenders by commanders and  the  longer, more  severe  sentences imposed by courts-martial judges.

The  Army  Correctional System  in  fiscal  year 1982  consisted of twelve CO NUS  detention facilities,  six OCON  US facilities,  the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks (USDB)  at Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas, and  the  U.S.  Army  Retraining Brigade (USARB)  at  Fort  Riley, Kansas.  Installation detention facilities  held  pretrial prisoners as well  as  short-term prisoners after trial. The USDB  held  long› term  prisoners, and  the  USARB  operated a retraining program for selected off enders, offering the opportunity to return to duty.  Because  of  declining numbers of  prisoners eligible  for  the retraining program, the  brigade assumed the  additional mission of  confinement without training. This adjustment allowed  suc› cessful  management of  the  high prisoner population .

After a  year of  study to determine the best management structure for Army  law  enforcement, the U.S.  Army Military Police  Operations Agency  was formally  and  permanently organ› ized  on  22 March 1982 as a field  operating agency  of the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel. The  agency  had  been  established on  a  trial basis  in  March 1981  to  monitor implementation of Army  law  enforcement policy,  develop and  promulgate opera› tional and technical guidance for military police, and provide guidance  and  assistance  to other  Army  law enforcement elements.

The  Secretary of  the  Army  was the  DOD  executive  agent  for administering the U.S.  Enemy Prisoner of  War and Detainee Program according to  the  Geneva Conventions for  the Protec› tion  of  War  Victims  of  12 August 1949.  During fiscal  year 1982 the  Army  made  steady  progress in  addressing problems  concern› ing  enemy prisoners of  war  and  other detainees that had  been raised  during training exercises MOBEX 78 and  80 and  at  a spe› cial  worldwide conference held in October 1979.  In the first update of  Army  policy  on  this  subject  since  1963, Army  Regula› tion  190-8,  "Enemy Prisoners of  War:  Administration, Employ-

ment, and Compensation," was  published on 1 June 1982.  In addition, agreements were  made  with  the  Republic  of Korea  and the  Federal Republic  of  Germany which  would  allow the  United States  to transfer custody  of prisoners of war captured by Ameri› can  forces to  host nations while  retaining the  responsibility of processing and  accounting for  them . Since  host  nation support agreements provided only  a partial solution to  the  problem, the Army  also  developed plans  to  evacuate enemy  prisoners of  war to  the  continental United States .

## Civilian  Personnel

Civilian  personnel play  a  major role  in  the  Army's  readiness and  modernization. They  develop,  procure, store,  maintain, and distribute military weapons, equipment, repair parts, clothing, and  supplies;  provide  medical  services; and  keep  open  the  Army's vital communications network.  Civilians  also support base opera › tions  and training and help  improve the  quality  of  life  for  sol› diers  and  their families .

Although the  ratio  of  military  personnel to  Army  civilians  in military functions dropped sharply at  the  end of  the  Vietnam War  and remained almost constant through fiscal  year 1981 (about 2.4  to 1),  the number of  civilians  in  military functions (excluding indirect hire support personnel overseas) decreased greatly  in  absolute  terms-from 367,300  in June 1972 to 315,000 in  September 1980.  Since  1974  the  number of  Army  civilians  in military  functions dropped about 10 percent, while  overall  fed› eral  employment decreased only  1 percent over  the  same  period. Despite  a supplemental budget request, congressional approval, and a  hiring surge in the Department of  the Army, civilian strength, including indirect hir es overseas, only  increased from 360,500  to  371,200  in  fiscal  year 1981.

Recognizing the  problems caused  by the  shortage of  civilian personnel in  the Army  and  the  negative effect that borrowing military manpower had  on  readiness, Congress authorized the Army  an  increase  of  6,500  civilians in  fiscal year  1981 and  10,300 in  fiscal  year 1982,  for  a  total of 16,800,  to  replace borrowed military manpower and to  improve near -term readiness. This increase resulted in  an  authorized civilian  end  strength in  mili› tary  functions-those directly  supporting military  readiness-of 383,000  in  fiscal  year 1982.

As of  30  September 1982,  410,855 civilian  personnel under appropriated funds were  in  the  Department of  the  Army.  Ap › proximately 31,600 of  these were  employed in  civil  functions,

predominantly in  the  Corps of  Engineers. At  the  end  of  fiscal year 1982,  total  Department of  the Army  strength not  under appropriated funds was  33,125, a  decrease of  507  from fiscal year  1981. Of  the  total,  4,018  were  foreign nationals, 7,176  were military  personnel employed in  off-duty hours,  and  21,931  were U.S.  citizens.

While  the  recent increases in  civilian  personnel strength al› lowed  the  Army  to  return the  equivalent of  one  division  of  sol› diers  to their  units  and  to strengthen the  logistics base,  the  Army today  still  has  fewer civilian  employees than it  needs to  meet mission  requirements. The  growing  need  for  Army  civilian  per› sonnel  generated by  force  modernization and  other mission  re› quirements will probably continue to  outpace increases in  civil› ian strength ceilings. Furthermore, the shortfall will  not be covered by  manpower spaces saved through consolidations, realignments, or outside contracting for commercial activities. As  the  gap  between workload requirements and  actual  civilian strength widens,  civilian  manpower will be an  increasingly scarce resource .

Programs have existed for years, particularly in  overseas commands, to  help  family  members of  soldiers and  civilian  em› ployees  to  find  jobs as  Army  civilians.  These programs permit sound use  of  available skills  and support the  volunteer Army. The Army  currently employs over 20,000 family  members in overseas  civilian jobs  alone.

Emphasis on  employment assistance to  family  members in› creased during fiscal  year 1982.  A  presidential executive order authorized noncompetitive appointments to  competitive service positions  for  employees  returning to  the  United  States  after  com› pleting twenty-four months in  federal positions overseas. OPM published changes that  extended reinstatement eligiblity  to  cer› tain  employees who  left  the  federal service  to  accompany their military or  federal civilian  family member on  overseas assign› ment  and  made  provisions  more  flexible  for  crediting periods  of overseas  residence  and  employment toward  career  tenure. These policy changes  and  their  implementation by the  Army  will make family  members a  more viable recruitment source than ever before.

To  supplement its  Civilian Career Management Appraisal System,  the  Department of  the Army  recently developed the Army  Civilian  Career Evaluation System  (ACCESS),  which  fea› tured computerized rating and referral data, independent ap› praisals from employees and supervisors, knowledge and skill requirements, and  assessment linked to  specific  knowledge and skills based  on  their importance to  the job  being  filled.

Over  the  past  three and  one-half years  the  Army  has  imple› mented three performance management systems  mandated by the  Civil Service  Reform Act  (CSRA)  of  1978:  the  Senior  Execu› tive  Service  (SES),  the  Merit  Pay  System  (MPS),  and  the  General Performance Appraisal System (GPAS). These new  systems stressed  the  supervisor's responsibility to  establish  individual per› formance standards that support the organization's goals  and objectives; to discuss the standards with the employee at the beginning of  and during the performance appraisal period; to rate  the  employee's performance objectively  against  the  standards; and  to  use  the  appraisal as  a  basis  for  personnel actions such  as pay  increases, promotions, awards, reductions in grade, reas› signments, separations, and  training.

Improved recruitment of  capable  senior  executives  took  place in fiscal year  1982. There were  349  SES positions  in the  Army,  of which  317  were  filled  by  30  September 1982,  a  fill  ratio of  91 percent. This  was  a  sizable  increase over  fiscal  year 1981  when 292  positions were filled, a  fill  ratio of 84  percent. Some  76 percent of  the  vacancies in  the  SES were  in  the  hard-to-fill engi› neering and  scientific fields. This  improvement in  fill  ratio was attributed to  the  decline in  attrition of  senior executives and  to timely  recruitment. Fifteen minority members and  four  women were  in  the  Army SES at  the  end  of  fiscal  year 1982.

The  Army  SES  office  instituted two  projects to  improve re› cruitment in  April 1982-one involved automation of  SES  re› cords to  provide a  skills  inventory for faster reassignment and referral, and the other was  the employment of an executive recruiter to make personal contacts with the private sector, academia, federal agencies, and  other recruitment resources.

The Army held its nineteenth SES  performance manage› ment seminar from 10  to 12  May  1982.  Emphasis during the seminar was  on  developing performance standards and  linking them  to  individual development plans for  the  enhancement of executive management skills.  Twenty-six senior executives and military supervisors attended the  seminar.

Recognizing the  need for  monetary incentives to  retain qual› ity  senior executives, Congress raised the level  of  the "cap"  on executive salaries in  December 1981,  but  declined to  remove it completely. Congress and  the  OPM  also  reduced the  number of bonuses allowed  by  the 1978  CSRA  from  50  percent to  20  per› cent  of  executive strength, which  meant that only  fifty-two bo› nuses  could  be  awarded in  the  Army.  Seventeen career  SES mem› bers received the awards and accompanying bonuses; four received  the  Distinguished Rank  Awards  with  $20,000; and  thir› teen  received Meritorious Rank  Awards  with  $10,000 stipends.

The  Merit  Pay  System  (MPS) covering  supervisors and  man› agement  officials  in grades 13 and  above  was not  fully  successful in  providing pay  incentives for high quality performances. In accordance with the  CSRA of  1978, approximately 16,000 GS-13 through GS-15  positions were  converted to  merit pay  status  in October 1981.  The  first  year  of  the  MPS was adversely  affected by small  payouts resulting from  the  Comptroller General's rul› ing  of  8  September 1981,  which  stated that  the  OPM  merit  pay computation factor and  methodology would  cost  $50  million  to $74 million  more  annually than  the  GS pay  system . Accordingly, the  OPM  lowered  the  computation factor  for  GM employees  and increased the  guaranteed portion of  the  October 1981  raise  for merit pay  employees from 50  percent to 100  percent. To  im› prove the  situation the  Army  has  obtained OPM  approval for some  short-term reform, including an  increased funding factor for  "quality  step  increase" experience. This  and  related changes would  yield  about  $5  million  more  in  merit  pay  funds  for  Army civilian  employees during fiscal  year 1983.  OPM  also  agreed to grant  interim authority to  provide merit  pay employees  who  had rated  at least  "fully  successful"  an  annual increase  comparable to that  given  most  other federal employees. To  achieve  long-term improvements in  the  system,  the  military  services and  OSD devel› oped  proposals for  legislative  changes that  would  permit more equitable treatment of  merit pay  employees.

An  Armywide Merit  Pay  Planning Conference held  during 10-11  February 1982 reviewed  the  first  year's  experience under the  MPS and  recommended the  following:  guaranteed full,  com› parable  increases  for  employees rated fully  successful  or  higher; additional guidance for  MPS  coverage; and  a  higher merit  pay funding factor for  quality  step  increases.

In  other  actions  related to merit  pay,  the  Army  adopted guid › ance  of  the  Federal Labor  Relations Authority (FLRA)  on  MPS coverage,  which  resulted in  the  removal of  approximately 3,000 employees  from  the  system;  OPM  approved the  Army's  request to  raise  the  quality step  increase factor from  0.1  percent to  0.3 percent; and the OPM  granted the Army's  request for a  full, comparable increase to  merit pay  employees rated fully  success› ful  or  higher, provided that the  increase was  reviewed case  by case and  was not  automatic. The  Army  also joined other services and  OSD  in  supporting legislation for  the  return to  the  GS pay system  and  cash  rewards for  superior performance.

During the  past  year  the  Atlanta Field  Office  completed the first part of  a  two-phase GPAS  evaluation. Twenty -one  Army activities  participated in  assessing  the  DA experience during the

time  before  implementation and  in the  early  stage  of GPAS.  The activities  reported on  the  effectiveness of  the  system,  the  percep› tion of  the system  by  supervisors and employees, the level  of satisfaction, the use  of  system information, and the degree to which  GP  AS  goals  were attained, and provided recommenda› tions  for  improving the  system.  In  response to  problems identi› fied  in the  evaluation, the  Army  issued  guidance on  the  relation› ship  between major  job  elements and  individual standards and on  the  appraisal of collateral duties. A draft  AR 690-400 clarify› ing  and  simplifying the  GPAS,  as  well  as  the  merit pay  system, was coordinated late  in  the  fiscal  year.

As a means  of  controlling labor  costs,  Congress has  required DOD  to reduce the  number of  high  grade positions (GS-13  and above)  over  the  past  several  years.  Specifically,  Section  81 l(a)  of the 1978  DOD  Authorization Act  called  for  a  6-percent reduc› tion of DOD  civilian  personnel in the  grades  of GS-13  and  above. The 1980  DOD  Authorization Act  (PL  96---107) extended the reduction through 30 September 1980. The  DOD  Authorization Act  of  1981  required that  the  total  number of  DOD  high  grade civilian  personnel could not  exceed 96  percent of  the number employed  on  30 July  1977,  and  that  after  30 September 1982 the total  number of  high grade civilian  personnel could  not  exceed 94  percent of  the 1977  level.  The DOD  Authorization Act  of 1982  repealed the high grade civilian reduction requirement and  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  established the  Army's fiscal year  , 1982 ceiling  of  18,892  high  grade  civilian  personnel as the  new  baseline. OSD  would  allow  a  6-percent growth (1,134 positions) above  the  baseline without prior approval during fis› cal years 1982  and 1983.

The  DA high  grade  civilian  personnel requirements reported by  commanders for fiscal years 1982  and 1983  reflected the need  for  a  14.8-percent growth  above  their  1981 assigned  ceilings. Meeting these requirements would have  amounted to  a 17  .6percent rise  above  the  baseline. The  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief of Staff  for  Personnel, which  was designated the  executive  agency for  managing the  Army's  high  grade  civilian  resources, provided program guidance on  the  subject  to  major  commands and  Army staff agencies. DCSPER  directed aggressive position manage› ment  and  emphasized the  role  of  commanders in  managing their high  grade civilian  personnel resources.

In  a move  to enhance superior performance, the  Army  distri› buted a  revised AR  672-20 on  incentive awards, which  became effective  on  1 July 1982.  The  criteria for  the  sustained superior performance award (SSP  A)  and the  quality step  increase (QSI)

were  revised to  be  consistent with  the  General Performance Ap› praisal  System.  SSP  A remuneration was increased to allow a maxi› mum  cash  award of  15 percent of  the  basic  pay  rate.

During  fiscal  year  1982 charges of  unfair labor  practices con› tinued at  a  high rate. To  prevent too  much legal  action from being  taken,  the  Army  urged several  changes that  would  encour› age  informal attempts at  resolution before formal charges were filed.  However, the  Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), created by the  CSRA  of  1978,  continued to  expand the  scope  of bargaining in  federal labor-management relations. Federal  courts upheld several of  the authority's early decisions, such  as  those requiring bargaining on  stays  of  disciplinary actions and  on  de› tails  by  seniority. Only  in  assigning work  and  in  contracting out was management's right not  to bargain left  intact. Federal courts reversed FLRA  decisions  in  several  cases,  such  as the  appeals on disciplinary actions against National Guard technicians and  the disallowance  of  per  diem  expenses for  union representatives who are  granted official time  to  attend contract negotiations.

More  and  more  of  the  recent advances in  office technology and  automated management information systems  are  being  ap› plied  to  improve timeliness, correctness, and  effectiveness of op› erations in  civilian  personnel offices  (CPOs).  In  this  connection, The  Adjutant General's Office  conducted a  study  on  the  require› ments of medium-sized CPOs. The study suggested that cost savings  of  approximately $70  million could be  realized over  a five-year  period by  purchasing $20  million  worth  of  office  auto› mation  equipment and  services  for  nearly 200  civilian  personnel offices.  A request for  funding the  equipment was submitted un› der  the DOD capital  improvement program, and  a project steer› ing  committee was established as well  as a full-time task  force  to support the  effort.

On 7 January 1982,  the  Assistant Secretary of  the  Army  for Manpower and Reserve Affairs approved the charter for the Army  Civilian  Personnel System  (ACPERS),  a centralized man› agement system  that  would  provide total  personnel information requirements for  mobilization and  peacetime. Designed to  sup› port changing needs at all levels within the Army command structure and  projected to  replace all automated civilian  person› nel  systems  now  used  in the  Army,  ACPERS  implementation was scheduled for  fiscal  years 1984  and 1985.

To  improve efficiency in  managing its civilian  employees, the Army  also  simplified pertinent regulations. The  Civilian  Person› nel  Center coordinated a  thorough review  of  these  regulations, and  those  found to  be  unnecessary or  overly  complex would  be

recommended for  elimination or  streamlining. Separate efforts were  either under way  or  under consideration to  simplify SES recruitment procedures, the  performance appraisal procedures under the  Merit  Pay and  General Performance Appraisal  systems, career  management policies  and  procedures, and  the  administra› tion  of  the  Merit Pay  System.

## The New Manning  System

At the  end  of  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  was ready  to imple› ment  the  first  phase of  a  new  system  for  manning combat  arms units. The New  Manning System  (NMS)  objectives  were  to  re› duce  personnel turbulence, to  improve cohesion, and  to  enable soldiers  to  cultivate a  meaningful and  lasting  sense  of  belonging to  one  of  the  Army's valorous and  distinguished regiments.

For  the  most  part, the  World War  II  combat soldiers served in one  regiment for  the  duration of  the  conflict. Many  who  came ashore in  North Africa in 1942  were  still  soldiering under the same  regimental colors  on  the  Elbe  River  in  May  of  1945.  The veterans  of that  war  look  back  with  immense pride  at their  shared experiences and their total commitment to  their units and to their comrades in  arms.

That kind  of  commitment and  system  of  manning and  sus› taining the Army has never been totally recaptured in the post-World War  II  period. In  the  Korean conflict,  soldiers  accu› mulated points determined by  their exposure to hostile fire; those  with  a  prescribed minimum were  eligible  to  return home. In  the  years  between Korea  and  Vietnam, the  Army,  with  some notable  exceptions like  the  GYROSCOPE and  the  Overseas Unit Replacement System  experiments, focused on  an  individual re› placement system  to  sustain units.

With  the  coming of  large-scale involvement in  Vietnam, the active Army  expanded rapidly and  formed units  for  deployment to  satisfy  ground force  requirements. Because  the  one-year tour policy  remained in effect after the introduction of units, the Army  resorted to  the use  of  an  "infusion" technique, in  which soldiers with  varying rotation dates were put into the units to preclude the  instantaneous breakup of  the  units one  year  after arriving in  country. While there were some  good reasons for sustaining the force this  way,  the potential for developing the enduring commitment and  relationships so characteristic of  the World  War  II  experience was  severely diminished.

The  post-Vietnam era  saw a series  of new  dimensions in  man› ning  the  Army.  The  draft system  ceased  to  exist  and  the  Volun-

teer  Army  was introduced. The  focus  was on  the  efficient  use  of human resources and the cost  of  maintaining adequate man› power  in  uniform. In  this  resource-driven environment, it  was natural that  the  Army  would  again  resort to  a  manning system that would distribute soldiers efficiently in accordance with priorities. The  individual replacement system  served the  Army well.  Flexible and efficient, it  facilitated management and put soldiers  where the  Army  needed them  quickly  and  fairly.  How› ever,  it also  generated personnel turbulence. The  constant flow of  personnel into  and  out  of  units  made  it extremely difficult to foster  cohesion  and  group solidarity, especially  in the  small  com› bat  arms  units  which  were  the  cutting edge  of the  Army.  Person› nel  turbulence inhibited improved combat  effectiveness and  im› peded commanders in  their efforts to  develop and maintain cohesive, well-trained  units.  Having  recognized  the  systemic short› coming of  the manning process, the Chief of  Staff, Army, in early 1981,  directed several  initiatives designed to  analyze  and correct the  Army's  manning system.

Project COHORT (Cohesion, Operational Readiness, and Training), initiated by FORSCOM  under  the  proponency of  the Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff for Operations and Plans (ODCSOPS), began testing the effectiveness of  accessioning, training, and introducing into the operational forces (both CONUS  and  OCONUS)  twenty company-sized  combat  arms  units formed for  a  three-year life  cycle  around a  group of  first-term soldiers  who  were  recruited specifically  for  these  units .

The Regimental System Study, developed by  the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), sought to  en› hance  cohesion  by adopting an  American regimental system  that drew  on  the  British and Canadian models. Although the 1957 Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS)  redesignated U.S. Army  units  to reflect  their  association with  nontactical regiments in order to  preserve the  continuity of distinguished units,  the  last phase of that initiative, establishment of a regimental head› quarters, was never  implemented. The  TRADOC  study  reviewed such concepts as regional affiliation, recruitment, package training, and  a regimental headquarters and  concluded that  the regimental system  could  be  applied to  the U.S. Army's  combat arms.  TRADOC  was then  given  the  mission  to develop  a plan  to implement an  American regimental system.  The primary con› sideration in  developing the  system  was the  organizational rela› tionship  between  regiments and  existing  organizations, brigades, and  divisions.  Subsequently, four  concepts  were  developed. Con› cept  Alpha invol ved  reinforcing the  present force structure by

superimposing regiments on  existing brigades. Soldiers would be affiliated with  a grouping of  stateside-overseas battalions with a  U.S.  home base.  Concept Bravo recommended assigning ad› ministrative functions to  a  Colonel of  the Regiment. Concept Charlie  would  establish  a  regimental headquarters separate from tactical  units and  include combat support (CS) and  combat ser› vice  support (CSS) elements. Concept Delta  envisioned convert› ing  from  a division-based Army  to one  founded on  combat,  com› bat  support, and  combat service  support regiments.

The study recommended implementing Concept Alpha by fiscal  year 1983.  Analysis  included investigating the  implications of  regimental affiliation, recruitment, training, unit rotation, personnel, and  logistical  management. A Concept  Alpha  feasibil› ity  analysis of  unit rotation concluded that battalion-level rota› tion  was  possible.

The Army  Cohesion and Stability Study (ARCOST), which addressed numerous initiatives to  reduce turbulence, improve stability,  and  enhance cohesion, was made  under the  proponency of  the  Office  of  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel (ODCSPER). It identified current personnel policies that undermined unit stability and cohesion, concluded that the individual replace› ment  system  created excessive  turbulence, and  recommended a unit  replacement system.  The  study  recommended a regimental structure, including aligned battalions, home-based careerists, regional recruiting, and  stateside-overseas rotation.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations and Plans  initiated three programs to  reduce the  frequency of  struc› ture changes-Management of Change, Implementation of Change, and MTOE Standardization. The Management of Change  policy  reduced authorization document changes  by limit› ing  the  time  period during which  MTOEs  can  be  modified. The Implementation of  Change policy required changes to  be  ap› plied  expeditiously. The  MTOE  Standardization policy  required that like-type unit authorizations be governed by  the same document.

The  U.S. Army  Concepts  Analysis  Age:µcy (CAA) conducted a series  of  related studies, called  Unit  Replacement System  Analy› sis (URSA),  to  evaluate the  feasibility  and  sustainability of  a  unit replacement system.  The first two  studies addressed the  impact of companyand  battalion-level movement on  personnel policies and procedures, distribution of  manpower resources, and the budget. The studies concluded that a  unit movement concept was  feasible and that it  would significantly increase personnel stability  in  the  units.

The  Army  Personnel System  Review,  conducted by  The In› spector General, identified and  studied each  of  eight personnel processes or "manning functions"-structure, acquire, train, distribute, deploy, sustain, develop, and separate. These func› tions  were managed by  various agencies and, while  each  could effectively  accomplish its own  objectives,  the  policies,  procedures, and  management information system for each process evolved somewhat independently of  the others and were  not mutually supportive. For instance, when the structure function was reviewed, the  large  number of  authorization documents and  the frequent modifications to these documents were found to  be disruptive to the  other functions. Because  of  the  time  needed for the  acquire, train, and  distribute functions, personnel were  some› times programmed and managed by  procedures based upon structure requirements that  were  no  longer valid.  The  eight  man› ning functions needed to be  synchronized into an interactive system.

In  another study,  entitled Personnel Replacement System  Pol› icy Analysis, the  General Research Corporation concluded that the  individual replacement system  caused personnel turbulence and  disrupted unit  cohesiveness. The  study  further asserted that personnel policies  had  evolved  that  supported the  philosophy of the  individual replacement system  and  had  therefore institution› alized  the  problem; it  recommended a  unit replacement system and  related policy  changes.

A follow-up  study,  Turbulence: Definition and  Measurement, linked turbulence with specific policies that caused personnel movement between units. It identified the individual replace› ment  system  as  the  predominant cause  of  turbulence, and per› sonnel  management by unit  as the  most  positive  corrective action that  could be  taken.

All of  these studies emphasized that the  problem of  person› nel  turbulence was inherent to  the  system,  requiring basic  philo› sophic  changes rather than  modifications to  present procedures. Units, not  individuals, must  be  the  focus  of  personnel manage› ment.  Unit  continuity, group cohesion and  stability,  and  organi› zational  loyalty  and  affiliation should  be  the  objectives  of  person› nel  management. The  "human goal"  was  unit  readiness. There› fore, an  entirely new  manning system  was  required.

Using these initiatives as  a  basis, the Chief of  Staff, Army, directed the  formation of  a task  force  to  develop and  implement a  manning system that would enhance combat effectiveness by keeping soldiers  together longer. He  also  directed that  this  objec› tive be  pursued through the  rotation and  replacement of units  in

an environment where  career  soldiers  were  offered the  opportu› nity  to  have  a  CONUS home  base  within  the  framework of  an American regimental system.

Accordingly, the  task  force developed a  New  Manning Sys› tem  which  would  integrate the  eight  manning functions, employ unit  replacement, and  affiliate  soldiers  with  a unit,  institution, or location. Under the new  system,  units-initially companyand battery-sized-were formed by  bringing first-termers and the cadre  together immediately after  initial  entry  training of the  new soldiers .  The soldiers in  the newly  formed unit would  remain together in  FORSCOM  for  approximately eighteen months.  Sta› bilizati&lt;m would  permit cohesion and  bonding to  develop trust and  affiliation-intangible elements so  important to  increas1.ng combat  readiness. Movement  into  and  out  of  the  unit  would  not be allowed  except  in  extreme cases,  such  as compassionate reas› signment or  discharge. After eighteen months, the  unit  would deploy  overseas to  a  long-tour area. Units  going to  short-tour assignments would  serve  twenty-four months in  CONUS, then deploy.  The  deployed unit  would  move  to its location  outside  the continental United  States  and  serve  out  the  remaining portion of its  three-year life  cycle.  At  that point first-termers either would leave  the  service  or  reenlist. Career cadre  would  be  reassigned, and  another like-type unit  would  take  over  the  equipment and mission  of  the  dissolving unit.

This unit formation, movement, and life  cycle  was  the es› sence  of  Project COHORT. Future units  formed under the  New Manning System  would  also  be  called  COHORTs after the  Ro› man  unit  and  the  acronym for  Cohesion, Operational Readiness, and  Training . COHORT units  would  embody the  principles of stabilization (in  a  unit) and  unit movement. Both  these  factors foster esprit de  corps-that intangible "why  men fight." The Army  can  and  does  teach  men  how  to fight;  it even  teaches  when and  where.  To  motivate a  man  to  risk  his  life  is something that cannot  be  learned; it  must  be  believed .

During the  next three years, a  comprehensive field  evalua› tion  will follow  the  progress of  the  New  Manning System.  The evaluation process  will be  carried out  on  a  fix-as-we-go  basis  in order to  identify proper paths  to  achieve  New  Manning System goals. If problems are encountered, solutions will  be  devised immediately. By  the end of the evaluation period, required policies, regulations, and  actions  should  have  been  accomplished, and  the  New  Manning System  should be  in  place  and institu› tionalized . This  is no  simple  matter, because  hundreds of person› nel  policies  are geared to  the individual, not the unit. These

policies  must  be  ferreted out  and  modified or  scrapped to  build a  new  unit movement system. Field commanders, staffs, and personnel managers all have  a part  to play  in this  endeavor. The goal  is  to  have soldiers train together, grow together, share together, and  stay  together, building the  bonds  of  cohesion in  a common purpose, anticipating each other's needs, caring for one another, and  ultimately  fighting  for  one  another, if necessary.

The  first of the  combat  arms  companies  that  enlisted  together, took  basic  and advanced training or one-station unit training together, and  moved  to their  first  operational unit  together have deployed  to Europe.  Both  units  were  from  Fort  Carson,  Colorado. Soldiers in  Company B,  6th Battalion, 32d  Armor, left  on 24 September 1982  to  become part of  the 2d  Armored Division Forward in Garlstedt, Germany. Soldiers in Battery C, 1st Battalion, 19th  Field  Artillery, left  on  29 September 1982 to join Battery  C,  1st Battalion, 14th  Field  Artillery, also in Garlstedt. At the  end  of fiscal year  1982, twenty-seven  other  COHORT compa› nies  were  on  duty  at  Fort  Bragg, North Carolina; Fort  Carson, Colorado; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Lewis,  Washington; Fort  Ord, California; Fort  Polk,  Louisiana; and Fort Riley, Kansas. Overseas, they will  be stationed at Boeblingen, Garlstedt, Goeppingen, and  Neu  Ulm  in  Germany; Vicenza,  Italy;  and  Fort  Wainwright, Alaska.  Current planning calls  for  an  increase to  about eighty rotating companies by  the end  of  fiscal  year 1985.

The  American Regimental System,  a separate but  related ac› tion  within  the  New  Manning System,  will have  many  facets.  The heart of  the system, as  noted earlier, will  be  the affiliation of soldiers with  a  regiment for the  entire length of  their service. Regiments  themselves  will be  home-based at  a CONUS  location. The  regimental colors  will be  located at  the  home  base  of  those CONUS  battalions assigned to  that regiment. Regiments will be pure organizations, for example, infantry regiments that have only  infantry battalions as  subordinate elements. The same  is true for light, mechanized, airborne infantry, armor, cannon field artillery, and air defense regiments. A  soldier who  is  a member  of a certain  regiment can  then  expect  recurring assign› ments  to the  regiment when  his normal  career  progression causes him to be assigned  to troop  duty.  Right  now, only infantry,  armor, cannon field  artillery, and  air  defense artillery regiments have been paired with  similar CONUS  battalions, and those paired battalions have  been linked to  form regiments. Regiments will normally  consist  of four  like-type  battalions, two outside  the  con› tinental United States  and  two  within.

The  regimental system  will enable  a soldier  to develop a sense of  belonging to  a  distinguished and  legendary regiment. When soldiers today are reassigned, they must constantly develop a new  allegiance, cultivate new  relationships, and  acclimate them› selves  to  a  new  organization's environment. The  regimental sys› tem  will  define a  community of  battalions both in  CONUS and overseas. Soldiers will  experience recurring assignments to  the battalions of  this  community, thus  reducing the  scope  and  imper› sonality  of  the  assignment alternatives. A  soldier will  be  able  to affiliate with  his  regiment for  the  duration of  his  career.

The regiment will  change a  soldier's focus from "mine" to "ours"  and  will operate as an  entity  without affecting the  pres› ent  brigade, tactical, or  combined arms  organization. The regi› ment will  be  represented by  an  honorary Colonel of  the Regi› ment  and  an  adjutant. Their purpose will be  to  give  meaning to the  system  and  organize individual efforts to  institutionalize the concept. The first six  adjutants have been designated by  the Military  Personnel Center. They  will act  as  regimental adjutants at  first as  an  additional duty. The process of  selecting the first honorary colonels of  the regiment has  already begun. Retired colonels and above  are  the  prime candidates for this  honorary position. The  Army  will work  with  them to  further develop the entire concept, duty standards, and  other related matters.

## Support  Services

The  physical  and  emotional well-being of  a  soldier depends upon the support services offered the soldier and his  or her dependents. These services  form the  keystone of  an  army's mo› rale and play an important role in maintaining an alert and highly  motivated force.

## Health Affairs

The Secretary of  the Army  and the Chief of  Staff, Army, made  achieving total  fitness  throughout the  Army  a priority and designated 1982 as the  Year  of  Physical  Fitness.  TRADOC estab› lished  the  Soldier Physical  Fitness  Center at  the  Soldier Support Center, Fort  Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, to begin  the  program, while  the  Army Medical Department (AMEDD)  provided sup› port through The Surgeon General's Task Force on Fitness, which  consisted of  four full-time AMEDD officers and  fourteen medical  and  nonmedical consultants. During the  past  year, the task  force  provided guidance for  the  over-forty medical  screen› ing  project, which  was  fielded in  June 1981  and scheduled for completion in July 1983.  During fiscal  year 1982  over  18,000  of 55,000  personnel were  screened, with  approximately 38  percent proceeding to  the  second level  of  screening-an exercise stress test.  A  significant amount of  non-symtomatic heart disease  was found, and  data  was  collected by  the  Armed Forces  Institute of Pathology (AFIP)  for  use  by  the  research community.

In  an  effort to  reduce the  number of  sudden deaths due  to exercise in  the un.der-forty population, the  Task Force on  Fit› ness  started the  Health Risk  Appraisal Program (HRAP)  at  the Command  and  General  Staff  College,  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas . Major  objectives of  the HRAP pilot  program were  to  provide a cost-effective, computer-assisted method of  screening for  occult cardiovascular disease in  a  predominantly under-forty popula› tion  before the  exercise level  was accelerated and  to evaluate the usefulness of  the  Centers for  Disease  Control (CDC)  Health Risk Appraisal questionnaire as both  a  primary cardiovascular screen› ing tool and as  a  method for initiating a  comprehensive risk intervention program. Preliminary results were  expected to  be published in  the  spring of  1983.  If  successful, this  pilot  program could  serve  as  a  model for  Armywide use.

The task  force's major work  was  in  the  area of  promoting total  fitness. The  main  thrust was  in  helping apparently healthy people to  modify their lifestyle in  a  positive way  to  reduce the effect  of  many  degenerative diseases. Specific  areas  of  emphasis were weight control, nutrition, stress management, substance (alcohol, tobacco, and drugs) abuse reduction, and  the  compo› nents of  physical fitness-strength, flexibility, and endurance. This  approach could  give  new  direction to Army  health  care  and be  cost  beneficial in  the  long  run.

Each  Army  medical activity (MEDDAC)  and  medical  center (MEDCEN)  worldwide formed a local  AMEDD  health  and  advi› sory  team under the  leadership of  the  commander, which  was the  focal  point for  the  Army's total  fitness program. Each  team was composed of  those  individuals (physicians, dietitians, physi› cal and  occupational therapists, social workers,  psychologists,  com› munity  health  and  preventive medicine  officers,  and  other health care  professionals) with  the  skills  necessary to  carry out  lifestyle modification programs. The  teams  will develop  and  provide  com› prehensive health education classes to  three target audiences: the  soldier, leadership groups, and  the  soldier's family.

The  total  cost  of  medical operations for  fiscal  year 1982  was $2,211.3 million, an  increase of  nearly $133  million  over  fiscal year  1981 expenditures. Funding increases gave  a growing  num› ber  of  physicians their required ancillary  support personnel, sev› eral  new  management information systems,  and  expanded hospi› tal facilities  at  Fort  Irwin, California. Other mission  changes  with budgetary implications included congressional designation of  the Army  as the  lead  agency  within  DOD  for  infectious disease  con› trol  and  combat dental research; also  the  Army Medical  Intelli› gence  and  Information Agency  was dissolved  and  a similar  agency was established that serviced all  of  DOD,  but  under administra› tive  control of  The Surgeon General.

The breakdown of  Army medical operations costs  is  as  fol› lows  (in  millions of  dollars):

During  fiscal  year  1982, .  The  Surgeon General was successful in  obtaining increases in  active  component Army  Nurse Corps

officers,  physician  assistants  (warrant officers)  and  enlisted medi› cal  support personnel. Total AMEDD  officer authorization in› creased by 279  over  fiscal  year 1981 . Authorized and  actual  end strengths by  corps were  as  follows :

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  medical  workload was character› ized by the  continued trend toward  outpatient care . While  admis› sions  increased somewhat, average length of  stay  continued to decrease. Average daily workload totals worldwide were as follows:

| Medical care composite units    | 38,515   |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Admissions . . . . . . . . .    | 1,113    |

| Live births . . . . . . . . . . | . . 122  |
| Clinic visits ......... ...     | 63,299   |

When  hospitals  and  clinics of the  Public  Health  Services  (PHS) closed in 1981,  the Army obtained the former San  Francisco PHS  hospital for  its  use  as well  as  the  St.  Louis  PHS  clinic.  Dur› ing  fiscal  year 1982,  the  San  Francisco hospital provided selec› tive  administrative and clinical space in  support of  Letterman Army  Medical  Center as  well  as  storage for  pre-positioned war reserve stocks.  The St.  Louis  clinic  was  used by  Health Services Command on  a test  basis  to  provide outpatient services  to benefi› ciaries  in  the  area. As a result of  its  successful operation, the  St. Louis  facility  will continue to  be  used  for  the  foreseeable future, thus  eliminating the  need  for  a previously  programmed construc› tion  project nearby, resulting in  a one-time savings  to  the  Army in excess  of  one  million  dollars. The  Army  also agreed to  reopen inpatient hospital services  at  Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. Those services had stopped in 1977  because of  reductions in AMEDD  officer authorizations. The Fort Benjamin Harrison Hospital formally reopened on  1 October 1982.

The first Strategic Planning Conference for senior leaders and  managers of  the  Army Medical  Department was conducted

during the  year. The three-day event focused on  Army  goals and objectives; on establishing a shared understanding of AMEDD  values,  mission,  goals,  and  objectives;  and  on  develop› ing  team  spirit  and  a  collective  process for  setting goals.

The  Civilian-Military  Contingency Hospital  System  (CMCHS), a  DOD  program to  provide civilian  hospital beds  for  casualties evacuated  to CO NUS  from  a major  conflict  outside  of the  United States,  was  directed by  the  Office  of  the  Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Health  Affairs)  and  was coordinated at  the  community level  by  commanders of  designated military medical treatment facilities of  the Army, Navy,  and Air Force. Participation by civilian  hospitals, which  would  be  accredited and  would  commit at least  fifty beds  each,  was purely  voluntary. CMCHS,  endorsed by  the American Medical  Association, American Hospital As› sociation,  American Osteopathic Association,  and  the Joint  Com› mission  on  Accreditation of  Hospitals, was initiated in  1980 with a goal  to  obtain a commitment of  at  least  50,000  beds.  As  of  22 October  1982, 48,187  beds  had  been  pledged  to the  entire  system, with  the  Army  responsible for 11,890  of  them. By  the  end of October, the  50,000-bed goal  had  been  reached.

Because  advances in technology ensured the  development of increasingly sophisticated weapons  that  would  subject  soldiers  to previously  unrecognized or  greatly  amplified  health  hazards,  The Surgeon General's responsibilities for  health hazard assessment (HHA) were  incorporated into the most  recent edition of  AR 1000-1, "Basic  Policies  for  Systems  Acquisition." To  carry  out these  duties,  the  Office  of  Health Hazard  Assessment  was estab› lished  in the  Preventive Medicine  Consultants Division  of  OTSG (Office  of  The Surgeon General) headed by  an  officer experi› enced in  industrial hygiene. A  draft AR  describing policies, procedures, and  responsibilities of  HHA  in support of  the  mate› riel  acquisition process  was completed, and  emphasis  was placed on  providing timely  technical and  consultative medical  support to  program managers.

The  Preventive Medicine Consultants Division,  OTSG, and Walter Reed  Army  Institute of  Research cosponsored a  work› shop  on  leptospirosis in May 1982. Leptospirosis had  emerged as a  disease  capable of  infecting large numbers of  soldiers at  the Jungle Operations Training Center in  Panama. In the fall  of 1981, the  Army  identified over  eighty  cases among  soldiers  who had  passed  through the  training center. The  goal  of  the  work› shop  was to develop  prevention and  treatment measures. Discus› sions revealed a lack of  knowledge concerning the  epidemiology of the  disease  in  Panama as well as its treatment and  prevention.

As a result,  surveillance activities  in  Panama were  increased, and drug  studies  began  which  would  explore methods for  both  pre› vention  and  early  treatment.

The Army  Medical  Department was  rebuilding its  surgical capabilities, which  had  reached their nadir in  1977,  by  concen› trating on  retaining and  recruiting quality  individuals. Although AMEDD  came  close  to  its  goals  in  certain surgical specialties (such as urology,  anesthesia, gynecology,  obstetrics,  and  ophthal› mology), significant shortages still  existed in  general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and  otolaryngology. Substan› tial  relief  was  not  anticipated until 1986,  when  individuals from ROTC  and  the  HPSP  delay  program would  become  available.  In the  critical  specialties,  the  AMEDD  started  sponsorship programs in  the  civilian  community, strengthened the teaching staffs of medical  centers,  and  offered fellowships  to outstanding surgeons for  training  in additional specialty areas,  such as surgical  oncology, joint replacement, pediatric surgery, and  retinal surgery.

Surgical  equipment was rapidly updated in  medical  facilities with  emphasis on  surgical intensive care units and anesthesia equipment. Special  projects were  successful  in  procuring surgi› cal  endoscopy and arthroscopic surgical equipment. Programs were  started to  modernize noninvasive vascular laboratories in medical  centers and to  supply appropriate vascular diagnostic equipment at  the  MEDDAC  level.

The  surgical  specialties  led in preparedness for  possible mobili› zation  situations, with  all surgical  short  courses  stressing military applications of surgical  techniques. The  Advanced  Training Life Support (A  TLS)  Course  was accepted at  all Army  medical  treat› ment facilities. In April 1982,  the first Mobile  Army  Surgical Hospital (MASH)  was  activated, and plans were  drawn up  to organize new MASH units  and  to convert some  combat  support hospitals  to  MASHs  over  a period of  several  years.  Surgical  sets and  kits were  reviewed  and  revised.  The  Research and  Develop› ment Command continued to  study trauma, while  other pro› grams  focused  on  wound  ballistics, blast  injury,  surgical  infection, and  burns.

On  1 October 1980  the  Department of  the  Army  was desig› nated by  OSD  as  the executive agent for veterinary matters, responsible for  providing veterinary support to DOD,  to all mili› tary  services,  and  to  the  Coast  Guard in  time  of  war.  Consolida› tion  of  Army-Air Force  Veterinary Services  was  scheduled for completion by  fiscal  year 1984.  During the  past  year  the  Army received  responsibility  for  veterinary duties  at ten  additional Navy installations, thus completing consolidation of  support for all

Navy and  Marine Corps  bases  worldwide. The  mission  at  forty› eight  Air  Force  and  two  DOD  installations was  also  transferred to  the  Army.

In  fiscal  year 1980,  the  Office of  the Secretary of  Defense had  directed that 102  military veterinary positions in  research and  development be  filled  by civilians.  Recruitment efforts were unsuccessful, however, and  the  military authorizations were  re› turned to  the  Army  in  fiscal  year 1982.  Congressional shorten› ing  of  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Veterinary Service  consolidation time  from  five years  to  three, coupled with  an  inability  to recruit and  train military veterinarians for research specialties during the  civilianization period, seriously  jeopardized DOD,  Navy,  and Air  Force  research programs. Air  Force  veterinarians could  no longer  support these  programs beyond  fiscal year  1983, nor  could they  fill  positions that  were  given  to  the  Army.

A memorandum of  understanding (MOU)  beiween  the  medi› cal  departments of  the Army  and  Air  Force  was  written which protected DOD,  Navy,  and  Air  Force  research and  development (R&amp;D) missions  by allowing  specialty-trained Air  Force  veterinari› ans  to  be  retained in  R&amp;D  positions for  a  limited period, thus giving  the  Army  time  to  train replacements and  establishing an orderly transfer of  all veterinary R&amp;D  positions to  the  Army  by fiscal  year 1987.  This MOU  met  the  congressional direction to protect the  interests of  the  individuals concerned, preserve criti› €al  R&amp;D  functions, and complete the consolidation as  expedi› t\iously as  possible.

A  memorandum of  understanding between DOD  and  the U.S.  Department of  Agriculture (USDA)  provided support by the  Army  Veterinary Corps  to  the  USDA  in  emergency animal disease  eradication programs. The  plan,  developed in  197  5, was tested  in a  joint  USDA-FORSCOM exercise  in August  1982, which simulated the  introduction and  subsequent spread of  foot-and› mouth  disease  in the  United States.  The  exercise  identified short› con:ii!1-gs  n  the i 197  5  plan and  prompted recommendations for rev1s1on.

The  UH-60A Black  Hawk  MEDEV AC  helicopter was intro› duced  to the  Army  at a formal  acceptance ceremony on  14  J  nu› a ary  1982 at Fort  Campbell, Kentucky. It  was another first  for  the 101st  Airborne Division  and the 326th Medical  Battalion. The Black  Hawk  MEDEV AC helicopter is a major  improvement over the  22-year-old  Army  UH-1 Huey.  The  Black Hawk  is the  Army's first helicopter designed with  a  MEDEV AC  litter  system  which provides  full  patient accessibility  and  easy  loading. The  speed  of the  Black  Hawk  is a  major advantage, since  time  is critical  and

rapid evacuation is vital.  Furthermore, the  speed and  range of the  Black  Hawk  allows  the  medical  commander flexibility  in  the strategic placement of  his  hospital and  clearing stations in  any combat  operation. The  Black Hawk  also has space  for  four  litters as opposed to  three in  the  Huey  in  the  combat configuration.

The  nerve  agent  antidote program was composed  of the Atro› pine Autoinjector, the Pralidoxime Chloride Autoinjector (2 PAM),  and  one  Atropine Autoinjector and one  2  PAM  Auto› injector linked  together with  a plastic  clip,  known  as the  Mark 1 Injector System.  TAB  (oxime  TMB4,  atropine, benactizine), the old  nerve  agent  antidote, was replaced  with Atropine and  2 PAM. The  injectors  were  saved  for  possible  reloading. Based  on  TOE› supported strength, the  first  issue  of Atropine Autoinjectors was centrally funded, procured, and  allotted to  MEDDACs  down  to the unit level by the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA).

Army  Medical  Specialist  Corps (AMSC)  activities  to  support readiness included the  completion and  subsequent DA approval of  a  MACRIT (Manpower Authorization Criteria) for  occupa› tional and physical therapists and their enlisted support per› sonnel, which  placed them in  more forward areas. A  similar MACRIT for medical food service support was  awaiting DA approval.

Army  dietitians ,  through the  Academy of  Health Sciences, worked  on  improving medical  field  feeding equipment and  hos› pital  rations and  updating medical  field  feeding doctrine. Dur› ing a training exercise  conducted in the  fall at Fort  Hood,  Texas, dietitians in  conjunction with  Natick  Laboratories field  tested a new  ward transporter for field hospitals, with  further testing scheduled for  November.

Specialty  consultants for medical food  service  and physical therapy worked 01:1 the standardization of  deployable medical equipment. By increasing liaison  with  medical specialists  in  the Army  Reserve  and  Army  National  Guard, they  enhanced Active Duty  Training/Inactive Duty  Training (ADT/IDT) opportuni› ties  and increased cooperation among  AMSC  personnel in  the Army's  active  and  reserve components .

The  AMSC  incr eased  its assistance to  local  commanders re› garding weight  control  and  nutrition education programs, physi› cal fitness  and  injury  prevention , and  stress-lifestyle  management. In  addition , a  full-time staff  of  a  physical  therapist and  dietitian at the  Physical  Fitness  Center, Soldier  Support Center, Fort  Ben› jamin  Harrison, Indiana, trained physical  activities specialists and battalion training NCOs  and  officers. A  full-time dietitian was assigned  to The  Surg eon  General's Physical  Fitness T ask Force.

There were  465  warrant officer physician assistants (PAs) on active  duty  at  the  close  of  fiscal  year 1982,  an  increase of  82 over the  previous year.  This  improvement was caused  by a high  reten› tion  rate  and  the  input from  the  Army's  PA training program at Fort Sam  Houston, Texas, which graduated a  class  every six months.  The  orthopedic and  aviation  medicine programs proved to be very  successful  and  will continue. Additional specialty  areas (including ear, nose, and throat, urology, general surgery, dermatology, and  family  practice) were  under study  for  PA  use. Plans  were  under way  to  affiliate the  PA  training program at  a baccalaureate level  and  to incorporate advanced cardiac  life  sup› port certification and additional trauma training into the pro› gram  curriculum.

The  Optical  Fabrication Laboratory at Fitzsimons  Army  Medi› cal Center began  providing reimbursable optical  support to  four selected VA  hospitals during 1982.  This was  made possible by the  Health Resources Sharing and  Emergency Act.  The support to  the VA  followed a  test to  determine cost  effectiveness and product quality. A  test protocol was  developed jointly by  the Office of  The Surgeon General and the Veterans Administra› tion  (VA)  covering such  details as  ordering instructions, reim› bursement procedures, and  materiel specifications. Test results proved that considerable money would be  saved on  a  quality product with  a  favorable turnaround service  time.

Active  Army  and  reserve component personnel could  now  be issued  spectacle  inserts for  protective masks  when  starting initial entry  training. The  change became  effective 1 October 1981 as a result  of  an  increased emphasis  on  nuclear, biological,  and  chemi› cal  warfare training .  The optical laboratories at Fort  Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; and the Brooke Army Medical Center in Fort Sam Houston, San  Antonio, Texas, supported the new  mission . Di› rected military overstrength was approved to  provide additional manpower where needed to  support the increased workload. Clinics  were authorized to request inserts for personnel with unaided binocular visual acuity who  did not meet the profile standards specified in AR 611-201.

## Chaplain  Activities

The chaplaincy filled the religious and moral needs of  the military community by  exercising spiritual leadership and  nur› ture of  individuals, providing free access  for  religious practice, affirming the  intrinsic worth  of  all soldiers, supervising material

acquisitions and  future developments, maintaining a position  of personal and  organizational readiness for  strategic deployment, and  managing resources to provide  for  mission  accomplishment.

On  24-30  April  1982,  the  Chief  of Chaplains hosted  a Minor› ity Ministries  Training Course  in Atlanta, Georgia.  The  theme  of the training course was  "The Challenge of  Cultural Ministry Amidst  Multi-cultural Needs." The  course focused on  ministry and effective spiritual leadership to persons having different racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds than the chaplain. Among  the  many  speakers were  Atlanta mayor  Andrew Young and Lt. Gen. Julius W. Becton, Jr., Deputy Commander, TRADOC.

A  $50,000 contract awarded to  the Triton Corporation of Washington, D.C., for a  study entitled "Preand Post-marital Chaplain Ministry  to  Military  Personnel and  Korean Nationals" was extended into  fiscal  year 1983.  The purpose of  the  study  is to  identify problems confronting American soldiers who  marry Korean  nationals and  to  provide chaplains with  strategies to  as› sist  in  a  more effective ministry to  transcultural couples .  As  a result  of  the  study  a handbook on  preand  postmarital counsel› ing  for  chaplains will be  printed and  will include recommenda› tions  about ongoing programs for  Korean spouses. In  addition, a  series  of  twelve  programs on  Asian-American cultural aware› ness  was  conducted by  the El  Pomar Renewal Center at Fort Carson,  Colorado.

A  team-building workshop for chaplains, chapel activity specialists, and  directors of  religious education at  Fort Carson was completed. This  pilot  program was developed as a research and  training model  and  produced significant results  in  the  areas of  role clarification, norms and standards, team stability ,  and performance without training.

Procurement, career development, and schooling received additional  emphasis. Chaplains  were  strongly  encouraged to  par› ticipate  in  nonresidence courses  and  short-term courses  directly related to  their work.  They  were  also  urged to  seek  diverse as› signments which  would  give  them  experience in  many  different facets of  soldier ministries .  Every effort was  made to  reduce personnel turbulence, which  was  a  continuing concern for the Chief  of  Chaplains.

The  chaplaincy continued to  improve its  mobilization plan› ning .  In  December 1981, the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Chaplains sponsored and  FORSCOM  hosted  a Mobilization  and  Army  Re› serve  Chaplain (MARCH)  Coordinators Workshop in  Atlanta. MARCH  coordinators from  all  mobilization stations, Arm y Re-

serve  commands, and  continental United  States  armies  as well as major  Army  command chaplains attended. The  conference was effective  in  providing guidance, information, and  definitive in› struction for  mobilization preparation and  also  highlighted the need  for  more  concentrated planning and  coordination between key  planners of  chaplain mobilization.

Effective  27 May  1982, the  U.S. Army  Equipment Authoriza› tion  Review  Activity  authorized that chaplain kits  be  issued to chaplains upon  their  entry  to  active  duty  or  upon assignment to U.S.  Army  Reserve  or  Army  National Guard troop units. This will prevent  a massive stockpiling  of chaplain  kits for  mobilization.

On  23 November 1979, two senior  Harvard law students  filed suit  in  the U.S.  District Court for the  Eastern District of  New York and  charged  that  the  Army  chaplaincy  violates  the  establish› ment  clause  of  the  First  Amendment to  the U.S.  Constitution. On  14 April  1982,  the  plaintiffs moved  for  summary  judgment. On  that same day, the government asked that the case be dismissed. On  19  May  1982,  the  government moved  for  sum› mary judgment. By the  end  of  fiscal  year  1982,  the  above  three motions,  along  with  a fourth to  compel  the  plaintiffs to submit  a copy  of  their tax  returns, were  still  before the judge.

## Food Service

Major  Army  commands designated 221  dining facilities  for upgrading under the Dining Facility Modernization Program during fiscal years  1984-1988  at a total  cost of  $120  million : $10 million  for  1984, $15  million  for  1985,  $13  million  for  1986, $41 million  for 1987,  and  $41  million  for 1988.

The fiscal  year 1982  Army  Military  Construction Program included the  modernization of  five  dining facilities  (four  at  Fort Dix, New Jersey,  and  one  at  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas)  at a cost of  one  million  dollars. Six  new  dining facilities  were  approved for  construction at  Fort  Benning (Georgia),  Fort  Ord  (California), and  Fort  Stewart (Georgia) as  well  as  three in  USAREUR, at  a total  cost  of  $7. 7  million.

At  the  end  of  fiscal  year  1982,  1,108  dining facilities  were  in operation worldwide  (653 in CO NUS,  455 overseas), 18 of which were  free-standing speciality or short-order facilities and 2  of which  were  field .ration  dining  halls  for  officers.  During the  year, 226,119,937 meals  were served, valued at $267,152,461. The one garrison bread bakery in Berlin, Germany, and the one central pastry  kitchen at  Aberdeen Proving  Ground, Maryland, continued operation.

Initial  planning began  in  September for  a long-term study  to develop a  manpower staffing standard for  table  of  distribution and  allowances (TDA)  dining facilities.  The result will be  a  for› mal  manpower standard based  on  workload that  will accurately reflect personnel requirements for  TDA  facilities.

TRADOC  and  DARCOM,  with support from  the  Troop Sup› port  Agency  (TSA),  continued to develop  the  Combat  Field  Feed› ing  System  (CFFS),  described in  last  year's report. Preliminary TRADOC  analysis indicated  that  the  CFFS would  improve  mobil› ity and  responsiveness of  highly  mobile  units  for  the  Army  of the 1990s  and  estimated that the  CFFS  would  reduce requirements for  food  service  personnel, fuel,  and  water  at  an  annual operat› ing cost savings  of $210  million  for  a mobilized  force.  The  Troop Support Agency  published the  T-Ration Menu  Development and Procurement Plan  to  support the CFFS . The services, at  OSD request, procured more than 250,000 tray  packs  during calen› dar  year 1982  to  ensure industrial l::&gt;ase  upport s for  the  system.

During fiscal  year 1982  the  Army  began  a major  initiative  to better familiarize soldiers with the wartime, nonperishable B-rations  by increasing their  use.Joint training  exercise  GALLANT EAGLE tested a  new concept in menu-configured pallets of B-rations that  contained all  the  required components for  break› fast  and  dinner meals  for  either twenty-five  or  fifty  men  for  one day.  A  program was  under way  to  ultimately afford table of organization and  equipment (TOE)  units  the  opportunity to serve at  least  one  B-ration meal  during field  training exercises  and  to continue evaluation of  the  concept for  menu-configured pallets.

A major  program to  improve the  logistical  sustainability and operational readiness of  the  M 1945  field  bakery was begun this year.  It  seeks  to  overcome unavailability of  repair parts, critical shortages of  components, and  training problems that had  a  se› vere  impact  on  unit  readiness and  mobilization  planning through› out  the  Army.  Repair parts valued  at  $350,000 were  purchased for  bakery units of  active  and reserve components, and plans were  made  to consider commercial parts  for  the  dough mix  and ~ake-up trailer in  order to  enhance unit mobility  and respon› siveness.

The  five  TSA-based Food  Management Assistance  Teams in operation visited 68  active  Army commands and installations, including lengthy visits  to  Germany, SET AF,  Korea, Hawaii, Alaska,  Puerto Rico,  Japan, Okinawa , and  Panama during the fiscal  year. They stopped at  526  active  Army and 312  reserve component dining facilities  and assisted 7,593  active  Army  and 1,974  Army Reserve and Army National Guard food service

personnel. In  addition, the  teams  continued to help  in the  opera› tion  of  newly  constructed or  modernized dining facilities .

Work  continued on  the  Army Food  Management Informa› tion System  (AFMIS), which  will  give  cost-effective automated support to  Army  food  service  operations by reducing administra› tive  workloads, improving management controls and respon› siveness,  and providing more reliable and efficient accounting and reporting practices. The Assistant Secretary of  the Army (Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management) approved the product manager charter on 25  February 1982,  and the Army  Audit  Agency  validated the  AFMIS  economic analysis.

Initiatives  to support Army  physical  fitness  objectives  included the  development of  a nutrition training package  for  food  service personnel and  the  establishment of  a  nutrition flasher message system,  which  provides information on  the  nutritive aspects of physical  fitness  and  health. The  Master  Menu  continued to  em› phasize low  calorie items, the posting of  calorie information at the  dining facility level,  and food preparation techniques that encourage good  nutrition and  diet.

In  the  field  of joint service  food-nutrition technology, proto› types  of the  Mobile  Food  Service  Unit,  a major  component of the new Army  Combat  Field  Feeding  System,  were  successfully  tested during three field  exercises, thus  verifying that  the  concept gives highly  mobile  units  the  ability  to  distribute highly  acceptable hot meals  with  minimal setup time  and manpower. A  prototype of the  Harvest Eagle  Food  Service  System,  a consolidated field  unit capable of feeding 1,100 troops, also met with success. As  a result, the  Air  Force planned to  refit all  of  its  war  reserve field support systems  and equip air  units in  the Rapid Deployment Force  with  this  new  system.  Other elements of  the  Army  Combat Field  Feeding System  were  tested and  evaluated by  the  Marine Corps  in  Norway  and  were  well received. New ration  dense  foods were tested on Navy  submarines; results indicated that these foods  would  significantly  increase the  voyage  endurance of  crews on  both  submarines and  surface ships.  A  new  hospital food  ser› vice system  was designed and  tested at  Moncrief Army  Commu› nity  Hospital, Fort  Jackson, South Carolina ,  which was  highly acceptable  to the  patients  and  resulted in significant  labor  savings. The  first  prototype of  a  liquid food  supplement packaged in  a flexible pouch for use  by  encapsulated military personnel in a toxic  environment was developed, and  several  subsistance pack› aging materials were  evaluated for vulnerability to  toxic  agent penetration . The  concept  for  a food  service  unit  with  a low identi› fying  signature, that was  toxic  rain protected, diesel operated,

and truck mounted and could be  operated by  personnel not trained in  food  service  was  developed to  provide this  necessary support for  ground-launched cruise  missile  flights. In  addition, planning began  on  systems  that  could  be  used  at Air  Force  bases under chemical warfare attack.

## Clothing and Personal Equipment

The  temperate camouflage battle dress  uniform (BDU)  was introduced as the  Army's  field  and  garrison uniform on  1 Octo› ber 1981.  The BDU  has  a  woodland-colored pattern, infrared reflection, and reinforced elbows, knees, and seat  in  a  50-50 cotton-nylon fabric.  It includes coat,  hat,  and  trousers and  repre› sents  the  second  stage  of  a  multiphased transition to  an  individ› ual  clothing and  equipment system  that  is  totally  camouflaged. The temperate BDU  is  part of  the Army's  battle dress system (BDS), which  includes four  camouflage subsystems  allowing  the Army to operate in temperate, desert, tropical, and arctic environments.

Work  continued on  a  camouflage overgarment to supple› ment  the  new  battle dress uniform system.  This overgarment, which  incorporates the  battle  dress  (fatigue) uniform's 6.8-ounce nylon  and  cotton fabric  as  the  outer layer, passed  development and  operational tests  and  was approved for  limited  procurement by the  U.S.  Army  Support Activity  in  Philadelphia.

The  memorandum of  understanding (MOU)  on  the  transfer of the  operation and  management of the  Army  Military  Clothing Sales Stores  (AMCSS)  to the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange Ser› vice  (AAFES)  was  signed  on  10 July 1981  and  became  effective for  all  AMCSS  in  the  first  quarter of  fiscal  year 1982.

A contract study, sponsored by  ODCSLOG and  initiated in May 1981, examined the  existing  personal, optional, and  organi› zational  clothing and .  individual equipment management process of  the  Army  and  recommended a more  economical and  respon› sive system.  The  following  elements of  study  were  approved for implementation effective 1 October 1982:  a  simplified require› ments  document; a  statement of  need-clothing and  individual equipment (SN-CIE); a  MACOM-level clothing advisory  group (CAG);  a  commodity management office (CMO)  within HQ, DARCOM;  an  Army  clothing and equipment board (ACEB), cochaired by  the  DCSPER  (for  personal and  optional clothing) and the DCSLOG  (for  organizational clothing and individual equipment items); and an  Army  staff proponent office  within ODCSLOG.

The  Army  Chief  of Staff  approved several  recommendations of  the  Army  Uniform Board (AUB).  These included adopting the  AG-344 trooper cap  for  optional purchase and  wear  by male and  female  soldiers  when  the  Army  green  uniform is worn  with the  black  all-weather coat, green overcoat, or green raincoat; accepting a  100-percent texturized polyester fabric for use  in optional-purchase, washable Army  green trousers, skirts, and slacks;  adopting the  camouflage maternity work  uniform as or› ganizational clothing (basis  of  issue  will be  two  uniforms, either the  camouflage maternity work  uniform or  the  white  maternity uniform, as determined by the  commander); implementing new optional-purchase blue  and  white  mess  uniforms for  female  en› listed  and  officer personnel; and  discontinuing the  issue  of  the white  scarf  to female  enlisted  soldiers  (  only  the  black  scarf  will be authorized for optional purchase and wear  with  the  black  all› weather coat  by  all  soldiers, male  and  female).  The prohibition against male soldiers carrying an  umbrella while  in  uniform continued.

## Pay,  Leave,  and  Travel

During  the  period  January-April 1982, the  Army  participated in  a joint services  study  group set  up  to  determine a  definitive mechanism  for  military  pay adjustment. OSD initiated  the  study, and  the  Navy directed it. A professional, administrative, technical, and clerical (PA  TC) survey had been used to  determine pay increases for  both  federal civilian  and  military  personnel. How› ever,  the  study  group felt  that  the  survey  was not  representative of the  mix of  military  skill specialties,  and  during the  assessment of various  surveys  and  indices,  they  placed  primary emphasis  on identifying the most  representative military skills. The study group recommended that  the  military pay  mechanism be  sepa› rated from the General Schedule - PA TC  system  and that the annual wage  change in  the  Wage  and  Salary  Series  of  the  Em› ployment  Cost Index  (ECI)  be used  instead,  since  the  ECI  repre› sented more improved skill  correlation (65-70 percent as  op› posed  to  12-18  percent).

The  General Accounting Office  (GAO)  evaluated these  rec› ommendations and  stated  in a report to the  Secretary of Defense on  28  September 1982  that  there were  advantages to  using the ECI  over  other  available  indices.  However, they  noted  some  fac› tors which  deserved consideration. There was  a  need for an alternative pay  plan  option. Presidents needed such  authority to deal  with  unusual economic  situations, but  it should  be  no  easier

nor  more  difficult  for  Congress to  override than  similar  alterna› tive  plans affecting federal civilian employees. Any  proposed legislation to switch to the ECI should include a  catch-up provision. The possibility of  reducing the six-month time  lag between  the  date  of  the  index  and  the  date  of  the  effective pay adjustment was also  considered.

The  final  report of  the  President's Military  Manpower Task Force  (MMTF)  was  released on  18 October 1982.  The MMTF agreed  that  the  ECI  would  be a more  appropriate base  point  for military  pay  adjustments, and  concluded that  the  President must have  some  flexibility  in  varying the  pay  adjustment through an alternative plan  when  conditions demanded.

Since  1967,  annual military pay  adjustments have  been  ap› proved on  a  "matching increase" principle based  on  approved adjustments in  federal civilian  pay,  which  are  subject  to changes in  the  PA  TC.  The  connection between  federal civilian  and  mili› tary  pay  adjustments was specifically  suspended by  Congress in fiscal years  1981 and  1982. Federal  civilian pay comparisons with the  growth of  wages  in  the  private sector showed  that  the  pay caps  imposed on  annual adjustments during the  previous four years  had  caused a  decrease of  18.47  percent in  comparability. Although President Reagan acknowledged this  loss,  he  submit› ted  an  alternative pay  plan  calling for a  4-percent increase in support of his national economic  recovery  plan.  The  comparison of  military pay  with  wage  growth in  the  private sector  revealed that significant increases in  the past two  years have  regained rough pay  comparability. Even  though wage  growth in  the  pri› vate  sector  over  the  past  year  ranged between  8 and  9.5  percent, depending on the index examined (PA TC growth was  9. 5 percent), a 4-percent annual pay  raise  was approved for  federal civilian  and military personnel. As  a  result, federal civilian  pay lagged behind the private sector by  14.5  percent and military pay  lagged  by  5.5  percent.

In  September 1982,  staff  members of  the  General Account› ing  Office stated that the military bonus system  was  not  cost effective. Although Congress had instituted cash  awards as  a highly  selective  means  of  obtaining and  retaining qualified per› sonnel in  hard-to-fill specialties, approximately one-half of  all jobs  qualified for  reenlistment bonuses. The  Department of  De› fense  countered by stating that, as a  result of  the  bonus system, recruitment and retention rates had  increased, while  turnover and  training expenses had  decreased.

Changes  in military  retirement pay  were  made  in  the  Omni› bus  Budget Reconciliation Act of  1982  (PL-253), which  affected

all  military retirees. One  provision limited the  annual cost-of› living  adjustments to  one-half of  the  increase in  the  Consumer Price  Index (CPI)  for  retirees under sixty-two  years  of  age  for the  next three years. If  the  actual CPI  increase is  greater than projected, the  cost-of-living adjustment is  the total  of  one-half the projected increase plus  the full amount of  the difference between  the  actual  and  projected CPI  increases. Another provi› sion  delayed  the  annual adjustments by thirteen months  instead of  twelve  for  the  next three years.  Since  there was  no  catch -up clause,  retired pay  was  permanently reduced. Military  retirees subsequently employed by the  federal government would  offset cost-of-living  increases in  military retired pay  against  federal ci› vilian  pay  for  the  next three years.  Military  personnel first  em› ployed  as federal civilians  on  or  after ·  1 October 1982  must  buy into  civil service  retirement by  paying in  an  amount equal  to  7 percent of  all  basic  pay  received on  or  after 1 January 1957. These  provisions  did  not  apply  to disability  retirements resulting from injury or  disease received in  the  line  of  duty as  a  direct result  of  war  or  armed conflict.

Travel and transportation policies  in  the 1970s  resulted in soldiers  absorbing significant out-of-pocket costs  while  traveling on official  business.  This  situation adversely  affected morale  and retention. The Uniformed Services Pay  Act  of 1981  changed these  policies  to reduce the  soldiers' out-of-pocket expenses  and to improve  their  quality  of life.  A mileage  allowance  was granted for  one-way  travel while  transporting a  vehicle to  the port of embarkation and from the  port of  debarkation in  conjunction with a PCS (permanent change  of station).  Enlisted  service  mem› bers  on  TDY  (temporary duty)  were  authorized to  receive  either their basic  allowance for subsistence or the per diem  amount allowed for food, whichever was  greater. Previously, enlisted personnel were  given  subsistence in  kind.  During 1981,  interest in quality-of-life issues  intensified, and  the  policy begun  in  1980, whereby  service members  shipped  their  personal  household  goods to Germany,  was reviewed  to determine its cost effectiveness and impact  on  the  soldiers and  their families.  Examination revealed that  the  weight  allowance  for  shipping full  household goods  was not  cost  effective and  adversely affected the  soldiers and  their dependents. The  Army  changed its position  in order to  support the  provision  of  government furniture in  Germany, thereby  sav› ing  the  Army  money  and  giving  better support to  the  troops.

Career sea  pay  was  approved for  qualified Army  personnel on  23 April  1982 with  entitlement retroactive to  1  January 1981. The  monthly  rates  depended on  pay  grade  and  cumulative years

of  sea  duty. Members who  received career sea  pay  and who served  thirty-six consecutive months of  sea  duty  were  also  enti› tled  to a premium of $100  a month for  the  thirty-seventh consec› utive  month and  each  subsequent consecutive month  of sea duty served.  Approximately 400  of  718  Army  personnel with  marine field  MOSs  began  receiving career sea  pay  in August 1982,  most of  whom  were  assigned to  Fort Eustis  in  Virginia, Hawaii,  and the  Azores.

As  noted in  last  year's report, Public Law  96-579 allowed service members  without  dependents to decline  government quar› ters  and elect  instead to  receive a  basic  allowance for  quarters (BAQ).  Initially the  Army  excluded from this  option members (E-7  or above) who were  married to other  members  but  otherwise without dependents. Subsequently, the Army  Judge Advocate ruled  that  the  law providing the  option included these  members; confirmation was given  in legal  opinions from  the  Army  General Counsel and  the  OSD  General Counsel. As  a  result, the  Army instructed the  major commands and  installations to  extend the BAQ  option accordingly .

## Education

During  fiscal year  1982 the  Army  began  redesigning its Basic Skills Education Program into a  progressive continuum of achievement using  the  latest  educational technology. The  objec› tives were  to  develop  a competency-based, military-related proto› type  of  basic  skills  instruction for soldiers and to provide an opportunity for  those  who  did  not  graduate high  school  to  earn a  diploma or  certificate. This  effort was  needed because  of  re› duced resources, increased numbers of  recruits who  required such  education, the smaller population from which  to  recruit, the growing complexity of  military weapons systems, and the current program's lack  of  both a  common curriculum and a coherent assessment process  to  determine if  functional require› ments  for  mastering basic skills were  met.  The  continuum will be tied  more closely  to  the  educational standards and  professional development necessary for  reenlistment and  promotion to  staff sergeant.

Although AR  621-5, "Army  Continuing Education System (ACES),"  was completely revised  in  October 1981,  another over› haul  was called  for  because  of  a shift  from  micro  to  macro  man› agement as well as some  shortcomings discovered in  the  regula› tion.  These shortcomings included limited  flexibility  for  manag› ers of major  commands and  install ations,  lack of clear  definitions

for developing management strategies, and confused delinea› tion  in  the  roles  and responsibilities of  commands, educational services  offices  (ESOs),  and  counselors. By the  end  of  fiscal year 1982,  basic  research and plans were  under way  to  restructure AR 621-5 as  a  policy  and goals  document, allowing the  major commands to  develop their own  management strategies.

Several  other steps  were taken during the  year to  improve ACES. A chapter of  the  ACES  Management Handbook, contain› ing  information on  methods for assessing basic  needs and on data  sources,  was published and  distributed. The  Department of the Army (DA)  requested that each major command select a pilot  installation, pool  all available  expertise, and  conduct a com› prehensive needs assessment. A  multiservice panel on  educa› tional  needs was  planned for  the  American Education Associa› tion  convention in  San  Antonio, Texas. The  Department of  the Army  also  planned to  require each  major  command to  identify target groups to  set  objectives for  each  ACES  subprogram.

Programs and services of  the Army  Continuing Education System  were  offered at 374  education centers and subcenters during fiscal year 1982 with  a staff  of  1,283  DA civilians,  includ› ing  491  full-time counselors.

The  education level  of  incoming soldiers rose  during fiscal year  1982  because  of  higher enlistment standards, increased re› cruiting support, and greater youth unemployment. Although participation in ACES  programs and services increased, 48.3 percent of  Army  enlisted accessions  without prior service  had  a reading level below  ninth grade, while  those  in  category IV  held at  19.2  percent.

Soldiers  earned 4,162  high  school  diplomas and  12,605  high school  equivalency certificates, 15,682  vocational or  technical certifcates, 2,088  associate  degrees, 1,057 baccalaureate degrees, and 1,553  masters degrees. The Army  College Fund was  ex› tended nationwide and  90-percent tuition assistance  was author› ized  for  enlisted members in  grade E-5  and  above  with  less than fourteen years  service.

The Preseparation Counseling Program was  launched with the  publication of AR 621-5, 15 October 1981, and  all commands developed a  program during the fiscal year. The Adjutant General,  coordinator of  all Army  separation activities,  established a  special project office to  analyze and operate the separation process.

The  Army  Education Information System  (AREIS),  an  inter› active  computerized system  and adjunct to  counseling, was  de› signed to off er a  common set of  data bases for use  by  both

counselor and  soldier; provide an  automated library  of extensive information about  educational and  vocational opportunities, the enlisted promotion system, planning, goal setting, and value clarification for  soldiers; display this  information in  an  interest› ing and relevant format; and personalize the information by making use  of  a  stored soldier record and monitoring system. AREIS  has  four  subsystems: subsystem I  will give  an  overview  of the  content and  capabilities of  AREIS,  all  ACES  programs, and services  of  the  education center; subsystem II  will  help soldiers identify or clarify work-related interests, aptitudes and skills, and values; subsystem III will  supply soldiers with  goals; and subsystem IV  will  aid  counselors and  administrators. An  initial test of part of the AREIS system, consisting of an "interest inventory" and  education center "information segments" at  Fort Sill,  Oklahoma, indicated a  high degree of  soldier interest and acceptance. Further field tests were to  be  completed by  mid› fiscal  year 1983.

## Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation

Public Law 97-35,  13 August 1981, authorized an open  season, starting 1 October 1981 and  ending 30  September 1982, which permitted eligible  retired members to  enroll or  increase partici› pation in  the Survivor Benefit Plan  (SBP).  An  eligible  member could either sign  up for the first time with  the plan, increase existing  participation to  a  higher level,  change current children› only  coverage to  include a spouse,  or  elect  coverage for  a natural person with  an  insurable interest if  the member had  no  spouse or  dependent child.  A  two-year waiting  period before the  desig› nated beneficiary could become eligible to  receive an  annuity was  included in the law.  As  of  5  October 1982,  some 35,163 retirees opted to  take advantage of  the open season, of  whom 28,877 were  newly enrolled  and  6,286 changed their  participation.

An appropriation of  $5 million  ($1.5  million  for  the  Army)  in the fiscal  year 1982  Defense budget legislation resulted from congressional interest in  the  Fami~y Advocacy  Program. The  leg› islation  stated that  funds would  be  used  only  "to  establish a pro› gram of  child advocacy and family  counseling services to  deal with  problems of  child and  spouse abuse." Funds were  used  at the installation level  for model family advocacy projects, con› tracts for services, curriculum and training materials, training, staff, and  an  automated data system  to  supply information on the  incidence of  child  abuse and  neglect, spouse  abuse,  and  ser› vices  provided.

The Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS)  is  a  Department of  Defense (DOD)  computer-based system,  mandated by  Congress, which  contains data  on  military active  duty and retired members and  eligible  dependents who are  entitled to  military health  care  benefits. The  system  has  over 9.5  million  eligible  beneficiaries from  the  seven  uniformed ser› vices  enrolled in its data base. DOD  has  not  yet  determined whether DEERS  enrollment will  be extended overseas .  The DEERS  Program Office, DOD,  began  to make  the  system's  data base  accessible  to  military personnel offices  (MILPOs)  and  sup› plied DEERS  cathode ray tube (CRT) terminals to personnel offices  at  thirteen Army  installations along  with  a new  personnel information screen.

The  Department of  Defense, because  of  congressional pres› sure  to  tighten control over  the  unauthorized issue  of  identifica› tion  cards,  designed a more  tamper-proof card  system.  It  would be  tested during the  second quarter of  fiscal  year 1983  at  Fort Lee,  Virginia. The  Real  Time  Automated Personnel Identifica› tion System  (RAPIDS) will  interface with  the Defense Enroll› ment Eligibility Reporting System  (DEERS).  Personnel offices will  be  on line  with DEERS  and  will  be  able  to  determine an individual's eligibility status more  accurately through RAPIDS. A  major feature of  RAPIDS will  be  a  new, machine-readable identification card of  durable plastic. The use  of  RAPIDS in conjunction with  DEERS  was designed to detect  easily an  invalid card  or unauthorized use at the  time  it was presented for  benefits.

The  Army  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation Review Commit› tee  (MWRRC)  meets  twice  each  year  to  review  MWR  programs and  consider new  initiatives to  strengthen management and  im› prove use of resources for its programs in support of unit cohesion, personnel readiness and  retention, and  the  needs of soldiers  and  their  families.  The  committee reached several  major decisions  in  1982.  A  minimum of  40  percent of  the  net  income from package store beverages would  be  distributed to  installa› tions  for  operating programs and  capital  expenditure beginning in fiscal year  1984.  Up  to 50 percent of  the  package  store  profits could  be  distributed to  local  clubs  for  authorized spending, such as loan  repayments , capital  expenditures, and  centrali zed adminis› trative  and  training expenses. Ten  percent of  the  package store earnings would be  distributed to the Army  Club  Fund to  in› crease  loans  available  to  finance major  construction and  renova› tion of  Army clubs. The committee approved funding of  the $4. 7-million  shortfall in  Army  Club  Fund  cash  flow in fiscal year 1983 with  a variable-rate bridge loan  from  the  nonappropriated

fund  (NAF)  investment program to be repaid  in fiscal year  1984. A revised  list of NAF  major  construction projects,  valued  at $60.8 million, was  approved for fiscal  year 1982  along with  design completion and contracting for construction of  all  fiscal  year 1982  projects. Fiscal  year 1983  projects, valued  at  $34  million, were  approved subject  to  documentation and  review.  The  com› mittee  also directed The  Adjutant General to prepare a study  of the  concept  of merging the  Army  Morale  Support Fund  and  the Army  Club  Fund  into  a  single  central fund, the  Army  Commu› nity  Life  Fund, to  be  used primarily to  finance MWR  capital expenditures.

Ongoing  major  construction projects that  were  near  comple› tion as  the fiscal  year ended were phase I  of  the Fort Hood Belton  Lake  project, Fort  Hunter Liggett  physical  fitness  center and  playing fields, Fort Hood Officer Club  (renovation), Fort Knox  Officer Club  (renovation), Carlisle  Barracks Officer Club (renovation), Redstone Arsenal  Officer Club,  Fort  Jackson Offi› cer  Club,  and  Fort  Lee  Enlisted  Club.  Projects  completed during the  year included the Fort Buchanan Community Club, Fort Bliss  swimming pool cover, Aberdeen Proving Ground NCO Club, Aliamanu outdoor fields, Camp Casey  outdoor fields, Hanau sports  complex, and  Fort  Meade  Officer Club.

Two  firsts  in  the  construction of  Army  outdoor recreation facilities  were  accomplished at  Fort  Campbell in  fiscal year  1982. A nature center built  with  funds from  the  Sikes Act  and  started in  fiscal  year 1981 was finished, and  the  search  for  a director to manage  it began.  Design  work  was completed for  the  first  newly constructed check-out  center for  outdoor recreation equipment, which  will also  be  located at  Fort Campbell. Nearly  all  installa› tions  operate this  type  of  facility,  but  they  are  located  in  existing structures that  were  designed for  other functions.

Army  club  earnings increased 12 percent to $26.2  million  on revenues of  $389.9  million  during fiscal  year 1982.  Ninety  per› cent  of  the  clubs  were  profitable, a  record year  for  the  system. Clubs  alone  had  a net  income  of  $20.83  million  on  revenues of $274.92 million, also  up 12  percent. Meanwhile, the package stores  operated by  the  club  system  gave  $6.87  million  of  their earnings to  fund morale  support activities,  a  2-percent increase from  the  year  before. In  the  United States  and Far  East,  clubs operate package stores to  generate money  for  morale support activities  at  installations and  to  fund club  construction and  cen› tralized  support expenses. USAREUR  Class VI agency-operated package  stores  earned $15.56  million  on  revenues of $40.26  mil› lion  for  distribution to  morale, welfare, and  recreation (MWR) activities  in  Europe.

The  Army  Morale  Support Fund received $55  million  from the Army  and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)  in  1982. Morale  Support Fund  (MSF) operating programs were  supported by  $23.98 million; $25.7 million was  allocated for capital pur› chases  and  minor construction (CPMC);  and  $20.5  million  went toward the nonappropriated fund (NAF)  major construction program. The major commands responded to  the  challenge of meeting increased operation requirements by  generating $104 million  locally,  compared with  $79  million  in  the  previous year. Package  store  beverage income  accounted for  an  additional $17 million.  Recurring operating costs,  however, continued to  drain efforts to  reduce the  backlog  on  facility  improvement, with  per› sonnel  costs  alone  absorbing 67  percent of  every  dollar spent  on MSF programs. The  Army  Club  Fund  was abolished on  1 Octo› ber because of  depleting resources, and the remaining assets were  consolidated into the Army Morale Support Fund. The consolidation of  accounts and  the  creation of  one  fund reflected the increasing integration of nonappropriated funds at the installation, major  command, and  DA  levels  for  greater flexibil› ity  in  allocation.

Approval was  granted to  place  more slot  machines in  Army clubs  and  Armed Forces  Recreation Centers overseas where no violation of status of forces or other host nation agreements occurred. The decision was  based on a  need to  improve the recreation facilities and  opportunities available  to soldiers,  particu› larly  in  the  face  of  continually rising  operating costs  and  deterio› rating facilities. The 250  slot  machines in  operation since  April 1981 serving  the  Frankfurt and  Kaiserslautern military commu› nities  earned $2.2  million through July 1982.  Such  results en› couraged similar  expansion to  other overseas  military  communi› ties  at  the  option of  the  commander.

The  Army  Library Management Office (ALMO)  contracted for a study on "Integration of New Technology in Army Libraries,"  which  assessed  the  feasibility  of  introducing new  auto› mation  techniques into  Army  library processing activities,  exam› ined  and  recommended appropriate systems  and  configurations for  such  automation, and  determined implementation costs.  Plans to carry  out  recommendations would  establish  technical process› ing centers at each Army installation using an integrated, minicomputer-based turnkey library automation system to  in› crease the efficiency of  technical processing functions and the exchange of  resources among Army  libraries.

During fiscal  year 1982,  158,313  books  were  purchased for 276 libraries throughout the Army. Paperbound book kits

(25,930)  were  bought and  distributed to  units  and  activities  not having access  to  a  library, as  well  as  to  the troops from Fort Bragg  and  Fort  Campbell who  served  in  the  U.S.  contingent of the  Multinational Force  and  Observers (MFO)  in  the  Sinai . Spe› cial  purchases were  made  in  the  areas  of  war  games,  children's books,  and physical  fitness and  in  support of  Defense Activity for  the  Nontraditional Educational Support (DANTES)  program. Forty-one libraries participated in  the  Federal Library Informa› tion  Network for  shared cataloging and  interlibrary loans,  with T AGO  funding fifteen libraries and adding two  more during the  year.  The remainder were  funded by  major commands or installations.

Army  service  members participated in  nineteen interservice sports  competitions for  both  men  and  women  during fiscal year 1982,  taking eight first places, four second places, and three third  places. Army  team  members  selected  for armed  forces  teams also  competed in  eighteen national sports  competitions, includ› ing  the  Conseil International du  Sport Militaire (CISM)  where they  placed  first  in  two  events  and  second  in  two others. Thirty› five  Army athletes participated in the Fourth Annual Sports Festival  sponsored by  the  U.S.  Olympic Committee in  Indiana› polis,  Indiana, on  22-29  July 1982.

During fiscal  year 1982,  106  performing units toured mili› tary  installations throughout the  world for DOD  or  combined DOD-USO  shows, performing before  approximately 445,000 per› sonnel  in  nearly  3,000  performances. Celebrities in  many  fields presented a  wide  range of  entertainment.

Although  Army  recruiting has  generally  gone  extremely  well, Army  bands were still  facing shortages in  certain instrument areas.  To  improve this  situation the  Army  Bands  Office  contiued to  develop initiatives with  the  U.S.  Army  Recruiting Command (USAREC). New endeavors  included  a poster,  "Rhapsody  in Dress Blues"; a  recruiting handout, "Start Your  Music  Career in  an Army  Band"; and USAREC  funding of  band personnel to  re› cruit at  music  conventions. A  new  display  to  aid  in  convention recruiting was under development.

## Commissary and  Subsistence Supplies

During  fiscal year  1982, Congress, the  Office  of the  Secretary of Defense,  the  Department of the  Army,  and  marketing organi› zations focused considerable attention on Army commissary operations. Assistance visits  to the field and various training programs improved operations at  all levels  as sales  reached $1.5

104

billion.  At the  end  of the  fiscal year,  70 domestic  (in 50 states  and Puerto  Rico) commissary  stores  and  9 annexes  were  in operation. Overseas, 70  foreign stores and 29  annexes were open for business. The Fort Dix  commissary was  transferred to  the Air Force  on  28 June 1982.  A  new  commissary was constructed at Fort  Belvoir; the  Fort McPherson store  was  downgraded to  an annex of  Fort Gillem; and new  annexes were  opened at  Fort Story, Virginia, Kirchgeons, Germany, and Al  Batin, Saudi Arabia. In July,  commissary privileges were  restored to  all  mili› tary personnel serving in Korea. In compliance with a  con› gressional mandate, the  Joint Service Commissary Committee recommended that  a 5-percent  surcharge be applied  and  collected at  the  point  of  sale.  The use  of  scanning equipment, installed in the  commissary at  Fort Lee,  Virginia, in  September 1981  with excellent results, was  expanded to the commissary at Fort Belvoir,  also in Virginia,  in July  1982. Installation in 63 additional stores  is contemplated.

In  accordance with  Office  Management and  Budget  Circular A-76, the  Army  began cost  studies in  the  commissaries at  Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri,  and  Yuma  Proving  Ground, Arizona, to see if operation by civilians  under contract would  save money. Conversion to  this  contract method would  be carried out  only  if the studies indicated a  savings to  the government equal to  at least  10 percent of  personnel-related costs.  The outcome  of  the study  would  have  no  effect  on  commissary food  prices.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) which  transferred the troop  issue subsistence  supply  mission  from  the  200th  Theater Army  Materiel Management Center (T  AMMC)  to  the  Defense Subsistence  Region-Europe (DSR-E),  a Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA)  activity,  became effective 1 October 1982  and  provided several  advantages: (1)  realignment of  peacetime and  wartime missions,  thereby ensuring smoother transition to  war;  (2) con› solidation of  all  personnel in the USAREUR  Wholesale Sub› sistence  Supply  under one  agency;  and  (3) improvement of  the peacetime management of  subsistence supply.

## Family Housing  and  Homeowners Assistance

On 1  February 1982,  a  revised AR  210- 50,  "Installations Family Housing  Management," was published. It included  several recommendations made by  the Army Housing Committee following  its  1981  review  of  Army  housing and  the  opening of family housing for diversion for unmarried chaplains. The regulation also  made special provisions for COHORT family members deploying to  Europe on  three-year tours.

The  family  housing management account had  been  under› funded for  several  years.  To  improve the  fiscal  management of the  program, Army  leadership sought  and  obtained the  transfer of  the  account  back  to the  Department of  the  Army  as the  Army Family Housing  Program,  with full management effective  in fiscal year 1983.  Two  new  construction projects for 486  units were awarded during the  year  at  an  estimated cost  of  $37,920,000232  units  at  Fort  Drum, New York,  and  254 units  at  Fort  Irwin, California.

The Family Housing Maintenance, Repair, and Improve› ment (MRI) program consisted of  the following: Line Item Improvement Program-4 projects, $8,046,000; Minor Con› struction Program-$2,500,000; Energy Conservation Invest› ment Program-$27,200,000; and Maintenance and Repair Programs-$305,507 ,900.

The Housing Operation Management System  (HOMES),  a computer-aided tool  to  assist  Army personnel in  the  day-to-day management of  family  housing, billeting (unaccompanied per› sonnel and transient housing), community housing, financing, furnishings, and  facility  management, was under development. The  Assistant  Secretary of  the  Army  approved the  HOMES  mis› sion element needs  statement and  the  project  manager's charter, and  various workshops were  held  to  define housing functional areas  and  computer specifications.

By congressional  direction,  the  domestic  Family Housing  Leas› ing  Program of  1,043  units  was being  phased out.  On  the  other hand, overseas  leasing  authority increased from 10,497  units  in fiscal year  1981 to  12,961  units  by the  end  of fiscal year  1982 and is expected to  increase to  18,500  units  in  fiscal  year 1983.  The majority  of  these  units  were  allocated to  European installations.

On 1  October 1981  revised Variable Housing Allowance (VHA)  rates  took  effect.  The  VHA  program was established for all uniformed service  members who  lived  in areas  of  the  United States  (excluding Alaska  and  Hawaii)  where  housing costs  were at  least 15 percent higher than the  basic  allowance  for  quarters (BAQ).  The  VHA  was also available  for  members assigned  over› seas whose  families  lived  in  the  United States  (excluding Alaska and  Hawaii).  Its  purpose was to  give  service  members who  were assigned to  high  cost  areas more  money  to  off set  the  increased cost  of  housing.

A major  change  was made  in the  way VHA  was paid . In  fiscal year  1981 a VHA  rate  applied  to "grade  grouping." For  example, one rate  was set to cover E-4s,  E-5s,  and  E-6s.  This  method  tended to  overpay some  members and  underpay others. The  VHA  for

fiscal year  1982 was paid  according to  individual grades,  includ› ing officers  with over  four  years'  enlisted  service  (0 lE,  0-2E,  and 0-3E), to  better reflect the  different housing costs  incurred by each  grade.

Variable  Housing Allowance  rates  were  set according to mili› tary  housing areas (MHAs).  A  thorough analysis  was  made in fiscal  year 1982  to  ensure that an  MHA  encompassed a  geo› graphical  area  where  members  both  lived and  worked,  and  hous› ing  costs  were  examined to  ensure consistency throughout the MHA.  This  resulted in several  changes  in military  housing  areas.

As  executive agent for all  military services,  the  Army paid $3.2  million  under the  Homeowners Assistance  Program to  436 applicants in  fiscal  year 1982  as  a  result of  base  closures and realignment actions. Mortgage assumptions on  thirty-two prop› erties  acquired during the  period totaled $335,771.

## Quality of Life

In response to  1981  family-life  policy  decisions  by  the  Chief of  Staff,  the  Army  established three new vehicles  for  overseeing communication and  policy on Army  family issues. First, the Family Liaison  Office  (FLO)  was created to coordinate, review,  and  initi› ate  policy,  research, and  studies  on  families.  It  reported directly to  the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Personnel. Reporting to  the FLO  (but  located  within  The  Adjutant General's Quality  of  Life Office)  were  the  Family  Life  Communication Line  (FLCL)  and "News  for  Army Families," a  quarterly newsletter distributed worldwide.  The  FLCL  offered Army  family  members  easy access to Army  Headquarters for  defining and  resolving  specific  family problems  via a toll-free  hotline  service.  Although located  in Army Headquarters, both the FLO  and  the  FLCL  actively  promoted emphasis on  quality of  family life at major commands and installations.

In  its  first  year,  the  FLO  compiled a list  of  the  various  agen› cies and  staffs  within  the  Army  that  have  conducted research or studies  on  Army  families  and  examined the  relevancy  of specific studies, research findings, and ongoing data bases. The FLO also  initiated research in  spouse  employment, family  stress,  and family  demographics.

Two  worldwide  symposia  on  Army  families,  the  second  (1981) and  third (1982)  Army  Family  Symposia,  were  held . These  sym› posia  offered unique experiences for  hundreds of  family  mem› bers  to  define and rank issues  and to  communicate their con› cerns to  key  policy makers. The FLO  supported the Army's

participation in  these pioneering events  and  served  as  the  focal point  for  developing an  action plan  in  response to  issues  raised at  the  symposia.

The  Army  expanded employment assistance  to  family  mem› bers of  military personnel and civilian employees. In  January 1982  HQDA told commanders to  expand family  employment assistance  within  currently available  resources. Some  installations broadened their efforts to  provide employment assistance to family members. This included increased efforts to publicize vacancies,  development of  working relationships with  local  state employment offices  regarding jobs in  the  private sector, estab› lishment  of  a single  point-of-contact on  post  where  family  mem› bers  could obtain employment information, and presentations given  at  meetings attended by  family members regarding em› ployment opportunities.

The Leadership Division sponsored a  major conference at the Army  War  College in March 1982,  which established the philosophy  and  direction for  leadership initiatives.  Several  subse› quent  conferences clarified  and  refined these  efforts.  Three long› range support objectives were  prepared to  improve command environment, leadership doctrine and  training, and  the  person› nel  system.  The Leadership Division  was  assigned proponency for  the  human goal  in  1982.  The  initial  effort was to develop  an expanded meaning and philosophy for  this  concept. Emphasis was placed  on  the  role  of  the  Army  in  society  and  its need  to  be more  people-oriented.

## Memorial Affairs

Numerous actions  were  taken  during fiscal  year 1982  to  cor› rect  problems noted in  the  Concepts Analysis  Agency  study  of the  Army's  ability to  handle personnel killed  in  combat,  described in last year's  report. Cemetery operations and  mass casualty  pro› cedures were added to the graves registration (GR)  specialist program of  instruction; FM  10-63,  "Handling of  Deceased Per› sons  in  Theaters of  Operations," was revised  to include nuclear, biological,  and  chemical (NBC)  operations; and  an  HHC,  Quar› termaster Battalion (GR), was added to  the  force  structure in the reserve  components, and  two additional graves  registration com› panies will be  added during fiscal  year 1983.  Procedures were again established requiring a  fingerprint card in the military personnel record  jacket, and  Army  staff  functional responsibility for  graves  registration was transferred from  the  Troop Support Agency  (TSA)  to the  Quartermaster School  (QMS). Furthermore,

OACSI  was  asked  to  study  GR  doctrine of  allied and  Warsaw Pact  nations; a  program to  allow  GR  specialists to  train with civilian  mortuaries was  in  the planning stage; and a  GR  field manual  for  soldiers  not  in  graves  registration was being  written. Guidance to  ensure that all  active  Army soldiers have  a  pano› graphic  dental  x-ray  was promulgated, and  a program to investi› gate  the  interest of  graduate morticians in joining the  Individual Ready  Reserve (IRR) was begun.

## Postal  Service

The  Military  Postal  Service  Agency (MPSA),  organized as  a field  operating agency  of The  Adjutant General  in  1980, was the single  manager for  DOD  military  postal  service  functions world› wide.  During the  first  year  of  MPSA  operations, mail  service  to remote  areas  like Korea  and  Diego  Garcia  posed  severe  problems. Transit times  were  excessive,  and  mail  arrived  irregularly . MPSA coordinated an  intensive effort to  review  each  factor affecting mail  delivery,  arranged an  extensive network of  back-up flights where  possible, and  had  the  postal  elements  of the  services stream› line  their mail  processing and  transportation operations as  well as  schedules. Transit times  of  letter mail  to  Diego  Garcia  were reduced by  two  days,  and over 80  percent of  the letters now arrived within  eight days  of  postmark .  In Korea, well  over  80 percent of  the letters were delivered within seven  days .  The success of these  efforts led  to a program of intensive  mail  service management for other remote locations experiencing similar problems. The program consisted of  special monitoring, close communications, step-by-step  analysis  of  mail  flow, and  measure› ment  of  transit times  where possible .

While  the  Military  Airlift  Command (MAC)  provided an  in› valuable  service  to  countries with  no  or  insufficient commercial airlift, such  as  Guantanamo Bay,  Greenland, Diego  Garcia,  and Turkey,  commercial  carriers  generally  gave reliable  and  frequent service  to more  accessible  areas.  The  law required the  use of U.S. commercial carriers wherever possible.  Back-up  resources to  be used  in  the  event of  strikes or  other factors affecting U.S. air carriers were  required. With  the  help  of  the  U.S.  Postal  Service (USPS),  negotiations with  foreign back-up  carriers such  as  Brit› ish  Air, Alitalia, and  Japan Airlines resulted in  agreements to carry mail  that exceeded the capacity of U.S.  carriers from CONUS  to many  overseas  points  at  the  domestic rate . This  was significantly lower  than the  universal postal  union rate usually charged by  most  foreign carriers.

Historically there has  been a  shortage of  U.S.  commercial airlift to  move  the  great volumes  of  mail  to  and from  overseas locations during the November-February period. In the past, space  available  mail  (SAM),  excess  to  what  the  U.S.  commercial air carriers could handle, was  diverted to the Military Airlift Command. In many  instances this  was  a  costly  and inefficient operation. For  the 1981  Christmas period, MPSA coordinated a program of selective  improvement of  mail  transportation priori› ties,  which resulted in U.S.  airlines adjusting their cargo con› tracts and  adding additional airlift so  that all  military mail  for Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy was  transported by commercial carriers. A  significant improvement in  service  was achieved, and  the  number of  times  mail  had  to  be  handled was significantly reduced. This  program will be  repeated during the 1982  Christmas mail  rush.

The  Comptroller General (GAO)  submitted a report in J  nu› a ary  1980  entitled "How  Military  Postal  Service  Operations Can Be  Improved." In  response, the  Military  Postal  Service  Agency, working  with  the  USPS,  developed a standard, uniform measure› ment  system  that  produced reliable performance data  with  mini› mum  administrative work.  This  system,  the  Transit Time  Infor› mation System Military Mail  (TTISMM), filled the need of managers throughout the  Military  Postal  Service  (MPS),  as well as commanders at  all levels,  to  know  how  long  it takes  letter-class mail to reach armed forces overseas from various points in CONUS. TTISMM is  the basis for developing mail  delivery standards, monitoring actual performance, and  identifying and resolving mail processing and transportation problems in a systematic, disciplined way.

Deployment of  the  Multinational Force  and  Observers (MFO) to  the  Sinai  presented MPSA  with  its  first  from-the-ground-up MPS  support requirement. The isolation and  autonomy of  the force  presented challenges far  beyond those  normally encoun› tered  in  establishing overseas  postal  service.  Extensive  diplomatic negotiations were required to  overcome concerns such  as  na› tional sovereignty over postal service, equity of  service to all elements of the MFO,  and problems of  contraband entering postal channels.  By the  time  the  MFO  arrived  in the  Sinai, MPSA's efforts had  met  with  partial successthe  U.S.  element was able to send  and  receive  correspondence and  official  material through the MPS.  Persistence and accommodation brought complete success;  full  postal  service  to  all  national elements was achieved three months after the  MFO  took  up  its  positions in  the  Sinai.

The distribution of  MPS  operating costs  was  not resolved during the negotiation of the 1980  USPS  and DOD  Postal Agreement. Because  of  incomplete data  on  the  costs,  USPS  and DOD  agreed to  conduct a  survey of  MPS  operating costs  and selected  revenues generated through the  MPS.  Conflicting per› spectives on revenue data and resource requirements caused delays,  but  agreement was reached in  May  1982  and  the  survey was begun  in July.  Results  of  the  one-year survey  will be  used  by MPSA in negotiations between  DOD  and  USPS and  for  develop› ing  the  long-range goals  of  the  agency. Interim data from the survey  will  enable one  long-standing goal  to  be  realized when legislation  is introduced during the  first  session  of  the  98th  Con› gress to  allow  postage-free movement of  personal correspon› dence  moving  solely  within  the  MPS.

The  U.S.  Postal  Service  and  DOD  had  discussed  for  years  the problem of  how  to  reduce the flow  of  narcotics, black  market items,  and other contraband through the U.S.  mail  to  military post  offices overseas. By  the fall  of 1981  the discussions had reached a  stalemate. At  that time  the  Secretary of  Defense dis› patched a letter to  Postmaster General William  F. Bolger  asking for  his  help. Postmaster General Bolger  set  up  a  series  of  meet› ings  between the  general counsels  of  each  organization. To  pre› pare  for  these  meetings, the  DOD  general counsel  held  a  series of  conferences with  legal  representatives from  each  service  and MPSA, who  represented the  DOD  postal  operators. Subsequent meetings between the general counsels produced a  proposed policy  on  search and  seizure by  DOD  of  mail  in  MPO  channels overseas. The  proposal was  published in  the  April 1982 Federal Register. After final comments were received and reviewed, a policy  agreement was reached and  signed  by both  the  Secretary of  Defense and the Postmaster General in  August 1982.  The final  policy  statement is  currently being processed for  publica› tion  in  the Federal  Register and  for  inclusion in  Change 1 of  the DOD  Postal  Manual.

## Reserve Forces

Throughout its history the  United States  has  depended upon the  citizen  soldier to  round out  the  regular force  during periods of  widespread mobilization and  major conflict. Standing peace› time  forces  in  all  periods have  necessarily been  scaled  at  reason› able  and affordable levels  which would help deter aggression, provide a  ready defense, and furnish the ability to  respond promptly to  an  active  emergency or  potential threat. Over  time, an  expansion in  America's global responsibility, together with technological advances and a  consequent loss  in  reaction time, placed  an  increasing premium on  the  readiness of  reserve forces to  back  up  the  existing regulars.

The National Defense Act  of  1920  established the  Army  of the  United States as  an  organization of  three components: the Regular Army,  the  civilian  National Guard, and  the  Organized Reserves (now  the  Army Reserve). Using  the  regular establish› ment  to train  the  reserve components fostered cooperation, pro› moted  uniformity in  procedures and  professional standards, and prepared the way  for an  orderly and effective integration of reserve elements into the  active  Army when  needed. The pro› cess was  successfully tested in  World War  II.

Army  reserve components today are closely  affiliated with the active forces in funding, organization, training, doctrine, tactics,  weapons, and  equipment. Terms like One Army and Total Army are  not  empty catchwords, but  rather phrases designed to remind one  and all  of  the relationship between members of  a team.  During the  year, Secretary of  the Army  John 0. Marsh, Jr., stressed that the  Total Army,  today  more  than  ever  before, must  appear formidable in  the  eyes  of  prospective enemies;  Gen› eral  Edward C.  Meyer, the  Army  Chief  of  Staff,  placed the  Na› tional Guard and the Army  Reserve at  the heart of  milestone evolutionary processes represented in  the  Army  86 and  Air Land Battle  2000  studies.

The Army budget provides funds for pay, subsistence, allowances, travel, and related expenses for soldiers of  the re› serve  components as well  as the  active  Army. In  fiscal  year 1982 the  Army  National Guard was allocated $1.3  billion  to  support a total  end  strength of  398,016;  the  Army  Reserve  received $973.1 million  to  support a  total  end strength of  251,849.  Both  budget

and strength figures surpassed those of 1981,  and during the year  a  further increase was  sought for 1983.

## Force Structure

The  magnitude of  reserve force  participation in  the  common defense is  illustrated by  the  organizational structure of  the re› serve  components and  the  missions  assigned them.

The Army National Guard (ARNG), whose units must be ready  to  go  to  war  upon call,  provides 46  percent of  the  combat forces  of  the  Total Army.  In  1982,  8 of  the  Army's 24 divisions were  National Guard organizations, and  4 of the  16 active  Army divisions  were  each  designated to  receive  one  of  the  Guard's 22 brigades  upon  mobilization. The  Guard  also contained 4 armored cavalry  regiments, 2  special  forces groups, an  arctic  infantry re› connaissance group, 132  separate support battalions, 786  sepa› rate companies and detachments, 18  hospitals, and 341  head› quarters of  various types. Numerous actions were  taken in  the force  structure during the  year  to enhance the  Guard's, and  thus the  Total Army's, capabilities .

The Army Reserve (USAR), whose units would provide combat, combat support, and combat service support for the Army  upon mobilization, would deploy 57  percent of  its  units within  30 to 60 days  of  mobilization, and  virtually  all units  within 90  days . The importance of  the  Army Reserve  is evident in  the fact  that  many  of  its units  are  unique in  the  Total  Army  structure. In 1982,  for example, the Army Reserve provided all  of the Army's training divisions, all of its  judge advocate general detachments, and all  of  its  railway transportation units. It  also had  nearly  all of  the  Army's  civil affairs  units,  most  of  its psycho› logical  operations and  petroleum and  terminal service  units,  and a sizable 62  percent of  the  Army's  postmobilization hospital  units. Force  structure actions were in progress during the  year  to  im› prove  Reserve capabilities across  the  board, and  thus  the  Total Army.

## Strength  and  Personnel Management

The assigned strength of  the Army  National Guard at  the close  of  fiscal  year 1982  was  409,238 soldiers. By midyear, paid and  assigned strength exceeded end-of-year budget ceilings,  but reprogramming of departmental funds  enabled the  Chief  of Staff to  approve an  adjusted end  strength of  410,000. The  successful growth was  the result of  aggressive recruiting and retention

efforts, more  attractive incentives, and flexible enlistment and training options. The state of  the economy and international tensions  also  played  a  part  in  the  favorable personnel situation.

ARNG  officer  strength responded to  active  recruitment and retention programs by  reaching 40,387-the highest level  ever recorded and  a  full  98. 7  percent of  authorization. The  contin› ued growth in  officer strength was  also  reflected in  minority strength. Black officers  and  warrant officers  totaled 1,744, or 4.4 percent of  all  officers. While state officer candidate schools remained the primary source of  career officers, the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)  emerged as  a  key  source of lieutenants. A total  of  1,101  new  lieutenants were  appointed in the  ARNG  from  ROTC during fiscal  year 1982.  Most  of  these were  commissioned under the Early Commissioning Program (ECP).  The  increase in  officer accessions  could  be  attributed to several  factors,  including assignment of  ARNG  officers  to ROTC detachments, greater use  of guaranteed reserve forces duty contracts, and  additional funding of  ROTC  scholarships for  the Selected Reserve. Under this program, fifty two-year scholar› ships  were  awarded to  ARNG  members in  fiscal  year 1982.

ARNG enlistments  in the  fiscal year  reached  95,618,  which was 99.6  percent of  the  programmed objective.  Both  non-prior and prior service  enlistments continued to  exceed objectives,  to  the point  where  enlistment controls and  state  strength ceilings  had to  be  imposed to  hold the  Guard to  its  adjusted authorization. Quality  recruits continued to  be  the  goal,  as  it  was  throughout the  Total Army.

Within  the  favorable aggregate Guard strengths, there were also  gains  at  minority levels.  Black  representation increased by about  3,200  during the  year,  while  female  participation expanded by more  than  2,800.

The  paid  drill  strength of  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  at the  close of the  fiscal year  was approximately 242,900-the highest  level in a  decade. As  was  the  case  with  the  National Guard, the  USAR was so successful in recruiting and  retention that,  midway through the  year,  steps  had  to be  taken  to restrain growth  in order to stay within  budget  and  strength limits.  The  moving  forces  behind  the favorable personnel situation were  the  same  as those  that  influ› enced the Guard's progress. Despite corresponding improve› ments in strength levels  of  the  Individual Ready  Reserve (IRR), shortages  continued in  that  pool  of  pretrained manpower. From a  1978  low  of  144,000,  the IRR reached 225,000  at  the  end  of fiscal year 1982,  roughly half  of  the  desired target strength.

The  Reserve  Officers' Training Corps  program continued to serve  as  a  key  source of USAR  officers. In recent times the

ROTC  program has  produced about 7,000 graduating cadets per  year, about 1,000  of  whom  enter the  Reserve Forces  Duty Program. By the  middle  of the  decade, annual production under the  program is  expected to  exceed 10,500  officers, with  some 3,000  entering active  duty.

As the  Army  Reserve  personnel strength improved, minority membership gradually increased. Black  representation reached 58,770-over 23  percent of  assigned strength-while 39,909 women  served  in  troop program units, which  was  16.4  percent of  unit  strength.

## Training  and Readiness

The  reserve  components played  important roles  in  l  982joint readiness exercises, overseas deployment training, and  training with  the  active  Army. At  home,  in  Europe, and  in  the  Far  East, Guard  and  Reserve  units  took  part  in  a variety  of  exercises  such as GALLANT  EAGLE,  LOGEX,  BOLD EAGLE,  WINTEX, REFORGER, TEAM S\_PIRIT,  and  YAMA  SAKURA.

A plan  for  reserve component participation in joint training exercises  had  been  devised  to ensure several  years  of lead  time  in which  to  schedule and  fund reserve unit  wartime training with active  Army units under the CAPSTONE program. Begun in 1980, this  program seeks  to align  units  of all components to meet wartime  requirements, establish  unit  associations,  focus  organiza› tional  formats  for  force  planning, and  define  equipment, training, stationing, deployment, and modernization requirements and capabilities.

In  the  National Guard, in  addition to  overseas and  stateside training, a  small  unit  exchange program with  allied  nations was continued, involving Norway, the United Kingdom, Barbados, and  the  Dominican  Republic.  Units  of  up  to company size partici› pated  in  this  activity,  enhancing relationships between  countries ~nd  broadening personal perspectives and operational exper› ience .

Key ARNG  unit  personnel trained with  active  Army  counter› part  units  during the  year.  About 2,000  commissioned and  non› commissioned officers from selected Guard divisions and bri› gades  participated in  this  training to  promote individual tactical skills  and improve unit readiness. ARNG  undergraduate pilot training  was increased substantially  during the  year,  tactical intelli› gence training was  instituted on  a  modest scale,  and training courses  to  promote equal  employment opportunity and  to  com› bat  sexual harassment were  conducted at  Defense and Guard locations for  ARNG  personnel.

To  streamline mobilization processes  and  prepare the  Guard to  execute corresponding actions expeditiously, mobilization documents were  revised  in  1982.  In  other steps,  ARNG  officers were  assigned to  six  active installations and to  all  nine Army readiness and  mobilization regions  in order to improve the  inter› action  between  the  National  Guard  and  the  active  Army.  Twenty› two  units participated in  an  evaluation of  mobilization deploy› ment  readiness.

In  the  Army  Reserve, overseas  deployment training was ex› panded in 1982. More than 160  USAR units or cells were involved-the majority in  Europe, 15 in  Korea,  and 1 in Japan. Experience indicated that  cell  participation was more  appropri› ate  than  using  whole  units.  As a part  of  the  overseas  training, 27 USAR units  participated in  REFORGER  82 and  deployed in exer› cise aircraft.

The United States  joined with  Belgium , Canada, Denmark, France,  Germany, Italy,  Norway,  the  Netherlands, and  the  United Kingdom  in the  military  competition of the  Interallied Confedera› tion  of  Reserve Officers held  at  Fort Meade, Maryland, in  Au› gust  1982.  Three-man U.S.  teams  placed 2d,  3d,  7th, 19th,  and 20th  in  the  37-team matches.

Competitive marksmanship continued to be a useful  training activity as the  USAR  Shooting Squad  maintained its position  as a dominant force  in the  field . USAR  marksmen, as individuals and as team  members, won  several  U.S.  shooting championships and placed seventeen individuals (35  percent of  team strength) on the  U.S. Shooting Team  that  will compete in the  World  Shooting Championships. In the 1981  Shooting Championships of  the Americas, USAR  members of the U.S .  team won  29  gold ,  8 silver,  and 12 bronze medals  in  the  fifty  events  that  made  up  the championships. The USAR  Service  Rifle  Team also  swept  the Interservice Rifle  Championships, winning  three  of  the  five team events.

Individual Ready  Reserve  aviator training continued during 1982.  Approximately 400  IRR  aviators participated in  the  pro› gram  to produce qualified copilots  who  would  fill open  spaces  in aviation units of  the active  components upon mobilization .  In the  medical  field,  a newly  established physicians' assistant  course for  qualified USAR  personnel was  in  its  first  cycle  at  the  Acad› emy  of  Health Sciences  during the  year.

More  that 160  USAR  officers  were  selected  to  participate in various fields of  professional education in 1982.  Seventy-nine were  designated for senior service  college  resident or  nonresi› dent instruction, sixty-eight for command and staff college

courses,  and  six for  the  Logistics  Executive  Development Course. In  the  command and  staff  area, the  Armed Forces  Staff  College was opened to  USAR  personnel for  the  first  time.

## Equipment,  Maintenance,  and Modernization

In fiscal  year 1982  the  National Guard's equipment status was upgraded as  a  result of  several favorable factors, including product improvement, new procurement, delivery  of late models, exchange within Army  channels, and dedicated congressional appropriations. The most  significant gain  was  the delivery of modern  equipment to ARNG  roundout units  at  the  same  time  as their active  Army host  units. Issue  of  late  model M60A3  tanks and improved TOW  vehicles to  the 48th Infantry Brigade› roundout unit  of  the  24th  Infantry Division  (Mechanized)-was in  keeping with  the  Department of  Defense goal  of  equipping units,  regardless of  component, in  a  way  that  would  ensure or› ganizational integrity, maintenance compatibility, battlefield interoperability, and single-generation supply support. As  the year  closed,  the  2d  Armored Division's  ARNG  roundout battal› ion  was preparing to receive  the  Abrams tank  and  Bradley  fight› ing  vehicle  as  part of  the  upgrade program. New  communica› tions  equipment was  being  issued, armored personnel carriers equipped with  TOW  missiles were  received  in exchange for  vehi› cles  without these missiles,  and  weapons like  the  self-propelled howitzer were  being converted to  more advanced capabilities. Aircraft were also being upgraded along with the ground equipment.

Organizational clothing and  equipment received its share of attention in  the  upgrading process.  Fiscal year  funding was allo› cated  to procure chemical  defense  equipment, cold weather  cloth› ing '  and equipment, camouflage screen systems,  tents, tool  sets, binoculars, and  medical items,  all  necessary to  prepare military forces  to  carry out  their mission. In  the  area of  command and control, the  Worldwide Military  Command and  Control System was fielded at  mobilization sites  operated by the  Army  National Guard.

The  Army  Reserve's  equipment status  also  improved during the  year.  The  budget contained $112  million  to  equip  units  ear› marked  for  the  Rapid  Deployment Joint Task  Force,  $12  million for  stock fund  equipment associated  with force  structure changes, and  $33 million to outfit  early  deploying  units.  As with  the ARNG, the  USAR  purchased chemical  and  cold  weather equipment, and began  outfitting unit  personnel with the  new battle  dress  uniform.

Trucks and  fork  lifts  were  added to  the  inventory, and  the  first USAR decentralized service  support system,  providing data  pro› cessing  to  combat service  units, was delivered in  March 1982.

Despite progress in  equipment acquisition, there were  seri› ous  shortages in  USAR  wartime requirements as the  year  closed. An  improved personnel picture also  drew attention to  equip› ment  levels  because of  expanded training needs.

Regarding mobilization and  wartime  requirements, the  Chief of  the  Army  Reserve  estimated early  in  the  year  that  the  USAR lacked  about 1,200  tanks,  2,100  five-ton  trucks, 210 aircraft, and 230  pieces  of artillery-which added  up,  along  with  other needs, to  shortages in  excess  of  $4  billion.

Although dedicated appropriations-money appropriated by Congress  for  specific  individual components-contributed to re› serve  force  readiness, Army  budget personnel found that  sepa› rate funding was  more difficult to  track than a  single Army procurement appropriation that was  administered for  the  total force  on  a  first-to-fight basis  regardless of  component. Separate funding made supervision of  the overall equipment program more  complicated for the Army  managers, and units did not receive  equipment in  order of  priority.

## Facilities and  Construction

Like  their active Army  associates, the reserve components require  armories, warehouses, offices,  logistical centers,  and  train› ing  areas,  and  funds are  needed to purchase, construct, operate, and  maintain these  facilities.

In  fiscal  year 1982  the  Army  National Guard received $67.7 million in new obligational authority for facilities and con› struction, the  largest such  appropriation in  ARNG  history. De› spite  this  allocation, a construction backlog  of  an  estimated $800 million existed at year's end. Contracts were awarded for 57 major  projects totaling $36.5  million, 24  minor projects costing $2.3  million, $400,000 for energy conservation projects, and $700,000 for  security and  other type  projects.

The 1982  construction appropriation for  the  Army  Reserve totaled $65.2  million; coupled with  $13.5 million  in  funds car› ried  over  from  previous years,  this  left  $78. 7 million  available  for obligation, of  which  $50  million was  committed by  year's end. USAR estimated that  replacing obsolete  or  deteriorated facilities would  require $898  million-an increase of  some  $560  million over  the  backlog  of  a  decade before.

## Support  to Civil Authorities

Fiscal  year 1982  was  another active  period for  the  Army  Na› tional Guard as  it responded to emergencies throughout the United States and its  territories to  assist  in  the protection and preservation of  life  and property and  to  maintain order. From October 1981  through September 1982,  over 10,000 National Guardsmen responded to  316  call-ups in  all  of  the states and territories, which  made use  of  their organization and  discipline as  well  as \_their  training and expertise to  deal with  various civil emergenoes.

There were  six civil disturbance call-ups in  as  many  states  in 1982,  requiring 492  soldiers to  control antinuclear demonstra› tions against power plants and laboratories and to restore or maintain order in  prison disturbances and  strikes.

Natural disasters produced a hundred call-ups  involving for› est fires; snow, ice, and wind storms; tornadoes; and floods. There were  search and  rescue operations, medical evacuations, chemical spills, water hauls, power outages, structural fires, a train derailment, and three incidents involving explosive ord› nance  disposal to  challenge Guard capabilities across  the  board. All  of  the states and more than 8,500 troops were  involved in these  operations.

The  Guard's widespread role  in  emergency situations and  its active  participation in  public service  activities at  the  community level  enhanced its  standing with the American public and in› creased citizen understanding of  ARNG's place  in  the national defense picture.

Given the realities of state government-the common de› fense must take its  place among other constituents of  national life  and military forces must share in  finite resources-the re› serve  components fared reasonably well in  fiscal  year 1982.  The Army  National Guard and the Army Reserve ended the year with  improved readiness and with the prospect of increasing their preparedness through measured annual appropriations in the  coming years.

## Organization and  Management

Organization

John 0. Marsh,  Jr., was appointed Secretary of  the  Army  on 30 January 1981.  Secretary Marsh, a  man with  distinguished military  and  political  credentials, and  his  principal deputies had initiated several  actions  which,  by  October 1981,  had  begun to improve  the  morale  and  organization of  the  Army  staff.  Author› ity  was  decentralized as  far as  practicable, and action officers were  encouraged to  come up  with  innovative concepts and to participate fully  in  the  decision-making process.  The  Army's  top leaders  indicated clearly  their  own  priorities and  provided timely guidelines and  directives . These  actions  facilitated progress. For many  young action officers a  Pentagon assignment became a rewarding ,  if  exacting, experience; they  knew  they  would  have to live with  the  results  of  their  projects  when  they  were  transfer› red  to  the  field.

During fiscal  year 1982  several organizational changes oc› curred  within  the  Army  secretariat. Effective  22 November 1981, a new  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES) position  was established in the  Office , Assistant  Secretary of  the  Army  (Research, Develop› ment, and  Acquisition). This  new  position was  substantially an extention of  the  existing  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary of the  Army for  Research  and  Development. However,  the  position  now serves as a Principal Deputy  (Research, Development and  Acquisition). In  essence, the  incumbent Dr.  Amoretta M.  Hoeber wears  two hats . Still pending is a legislative  proposal by the  Department of Defense to  authorize another assistant secretary of  the Army position.

The  Army  Broadcasting Service  (ABS) was established 1  June 1980, under the  office  of  the  Chief  of  Public  Affairs,  in  response to  a  DOD  directive telling  the  secretaries of  the  military  depart› ments  to consolidate management and  control  of their  American Forces  Radio  and  Television Service  (AFRTS)  outlets. Effective 1  October 1982  the ABS  and all  Army AFRTS  outlets were combined  under  one  table  of distribution and  allowances  (TDA).

Th ere  were significant functional realignments within the Army  staff.  As  reported last  year, in  October 1980  the  Army established the Performance Management of  the Army  Staff

(PMAS) program under the  Director of  the  Army  Staff  to  assess the  progress of  the staff as  a  corporate body  in  accomplishing common  objectives.  Six common objectives  were  selected  for  the staff: manning the  total  force, training the  total  force, structur› ing  the total force, mobilizing and sustaining the total force, managing modernization, and  improving staff  procedure. Also last  year,  a  decision was announced in  May  1981  to  realign and integrate command,  control,  communications, and  computer (C4) management within  the  Army  staff.  Accordingly, in October 1981 the  Army  created the  Office  of  Assistant Deputy Chief  of  Staff for  Operations and  Plans  for  Command, Control, Communica› tions,  and  Computers (OADCSOPS-C4) headed by the  previous Assistant Chief of  Staff for Automation and Communications (ACSAC). The  Office  of the  Assistant  Chief  of Staff  for  Automa› tion and Communications (OACSAC) merged with  the Com› mand and Control Division of the ODCSOPS Requirements Directorate.

A  review  of  Army management duties in  the Management Directorate of  the  Office of  the Chief  of  Staff  led  to  a  realign› ment  of  functions between  the  Management Directorate and  the Office  of  the  Comptroller of  the  Army  (OCA).  The transferred functions highlight the role that OCA  plays in improving efficiency-primarily in  the  areas  of  review  and  analysis,  manage› ment  analysis, installation  management, and  special resource  man› agement analyses,  including commercial activities.  The Manage› ment  Directorate retained responsibility for  overall  management doctrine; base  reduction, realignment, and  closure actions; and field  operating agency  management. Realignment began  in April 1982 and  was completed in August 1982,  resulting in dissolution of  the  Army Management Division  and  its  replacement by  the Resource Management Directorate, OCA.

During  the  current fiscal year  thirteen base  realignment stud› ies or  actions  were  at  varying  degrees of completion. These  stud› ies  fell  into three groups :  studies in  progress, studies complete with  decisions  pending, and  realignments already implemented.

Five studies  are  almost  done  that  determine whether routine support functions for two  or  more installations could be  pro› vided  by a single  facility. These  studies  are  evaluating the  feasibil› ity  of  consolidating Anniston Army  Depot  and  Fort  McClellan, Alabama;  Fort  Bliss, Texas,  and  White  Sands,  New  Mexico;  Fort Monroe  and  Fort  Eustis,  Virginia; Fort  Ritchie  and  Fort  Detrick, Maryland; and  installations in  and  around Washington, D.C.

Studies have  been  completed and  decisions a\_re  pending re › garding the retention of  Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, and  Fort  Sheridan, Illinois.

Three decisions  were  announced which  resulted in  realign› ments  being  completed during this  period. The  operation of the Navajo  Army  Depot was  turned over  to  the  Arizona National Guard,  thus  releasing federal assets  to  meet  other requirements. Basic training  was terminated at Fort  Gordon, Georgia,  and  trans› ferred to  other Army training centers. Additionally, the 1st Battalion,  55th  Air  Defense  Artillery,  was moved  from  Fort  Bliss, Texas, to join its  parent division at  Fort Polk,  Louisiana. The realignment previously  announced at  Fort  MacArthur, California, was completed  on  1 October 1982, and  the  installation  was placed on  inactive  status.

The  Army  is reevaluating possible  locations  for  consolidating Headquarters, U.S.  Army  Intelligence and  Security Command. The  original decision to  consolidate at  Fort Meade, Maryland, was reversed.  Subsequently, the  Secretary  of the Army  announced his decision  to consolidate the  Intelligence Threat Analysis  Cen› ter  at  the  Washington Navy  Yard.

Implementation of  the  previously announced action  to move the  aircraft maintenance activity  from New  Cumberland Army Depot  to  Corpus Christi Army  Depot has  been delayed while questions raised by  the  House Appropriations Committee's Se› curity  and Investigation Team  are  being  studied.

No  further action has  been  taken by  the  Army  on  the  pro› posed  closure of  Fort Wadsworth, New  York.  Action  has  been deferred pending resolution of litigation  in  Federal  District  Court in Brooklyn over  disposal of  the  property.

The  Director  of the  Army  Staff  ordered that  the  Army  Force Modernization Coordination Office  (AFMCO)  be placed  tempo› rarily  under the  operational control  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff for  Operations and  Plans  (DCSOPS),  effective 16 October 1981. The chief, AFMCO, was  designated special assistant to  the DCSOPS  for  Modernization, although he  was  still  assigned to OCSA.

No AFMCO  spaces  have  been  allocated  to the  new  ODCSOPS directorate pending a  review of  recommendations made  by  a special  inspector general task  force  on  modernization, discussed elsewhere.

The  Armored Combat  Vehicle  Technology (ACVT)  System Management Office  was dissolved  as a part  of Office  of the  Chief of Staff,  Army  (OCSA),  on  30 March  1982.  Headquarters, Mate› riel Development and Readiness Command (HQ  DARCOM), and the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ODCSRDA)  assumed manage› ment  and  oversight of  the  program.

There were  several  significant changes and  realignments of functions within  ODCSPER. In  order to  reduce fragmentation of the  training and  development function and  place  it under the supervision of  a  member of the Senior Executive Service, to reduce overhead, and to accommodate reduced manpower authorizations, the  Training and  Development Office  was closed. Its  policy  functions are  being integrated with  related duties in the Staffing and Career Management Office .  Functions of  a nonpolicy  nature will be  assigned to the  U.S.  Army  Civilian  Per› sonnel  Center to  incorporate them  with  other operational train› ing  and  development duties. In  addition, the  Staffing and  Ca› reer Management Office  was  redesignated the  Staffing, Career Management, and  Training Office.

After  six recommendations were  proposed by the  Family  Ac› tion  Committee to  the  Chief  of  Staff,  the  Family  Liaison  Office (FLO)  was established in January 1982  as  part of  the  Office  of the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel (ODCSPER).  Its  main tasks  are to  advise the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Personnel (DCSPER)  on  military family  matters; to  coordinate programs and  develop  policy  for  improving the  quality  of  family  life in  the Army;  to provide  for  communications with  the  Army  in the  field and  a  forum for  conferences, symposia,  and  colloquia  to  stimu› late new  policy  considerations; and to  collect and maintain a central repository of  information, data, research, and demo› graphic projections related to Army family life. Under this charter, the  FLO  serves  as  a  link  between Army  families  in  the field  and  Headquarters, Department of the  Army.  Further infor› mation  can  be  found on  page 106.

The Inspector General's agency  and  office  underwent sev› eral  significant structural changes  during fiscal year  1982. These resulted from a  mission analysis which  led  to  a  fundamental change  in  operating philosophy. During the  period September to December 1981, a study  was conducted on  the  effectiveness of the  flow of information inside  and  outside  the  Inspector General (IG)  system.  Concurrently, an  IG  team studied Army  systems and force modernization and their relationship to  operations. The  findings  of both  studies  revealed a lack of coordination and synthesis  as  well  as  little  analysis.

As  reported last year The Inspector General determined that  a new inspection philosophy was necessary  to achieve  mean› ingful  improvement in  Army  and  IG  operations . The stress  on inspections  was moved  more  completely  away from  monitoring a unit'.s compliance with  policies  toward a  total  systems  approach aimed  at resolving  problems which  may be discovered  first  at the

unit level. Unit deficiencies may  actually be  manifestations of policy defects  at far  higher levels.  Inspections should  reveal  such defects  and  follow  through the  entire Army  system  to  find  solu› tions  (the  systemic  approach).

Team findings, combined with the change in operating concepts, caused The Inspector General to direct internal restructuring. Additionally, he  called  a moratorium on  DA level inspections while  DAIG  members studied Army  systems  in order to  conduct effective systemic  inspections.

To  make  better use  of  information available in  the DAIG system,  the  Information Management and  Analysis  Division  was created.  This  division  provides  automation support to the  agency. It  is also  the  focal  point for  analyzing DAIG  acquired informa› tion and developing DAIG's major issues concerning Army activities.  In  conjunction with  the  Audit  and  Inspection Followup Division,  it monitors data  for  trends and  recurring problems and makes  recommendations for proper action to  The Inspector General. A similar  program was begun  in the  Assistance  Division regarding the  analysis  of  complaint data.

Another new element  created as a result  of the  mission  analy› sis  was  the Force Modernization Division. Based on  the team which  analyzed Armywide systems, it  is  the primary point for training agency  personnel in  system  relationships and  their ef› fects  and for  identifying and  demonstrating their dependency. Beginning with FORSCOM in September 1981, at its com› mander's request, the division conducted systemic inspections worldwide to  define the  effect  of  diverse systems  on  each  other and  to demonstrate the  need  for  their  coordination. Additionally, it developed techniques of inspection to be  used  by all inspectors general. As fiscal  year 1982  closed,  the  division  was  designing a training program for  inspectors to be given  before  a series  of test inspections.

The  systemic concept  was also expanded to the  Training Man› agement Inspection Division.  Based  on  priorities established by the  Chief  of Staff,  the  division  conducted inspections in the  areas of  mobilization and  training standardization. Regarding mobili› zation, emphasis was  placed oh  the expansion of  the training base  and  the  effect  this  would  have  on  facilities  and  scheduling.

The  Technical Inspections Division  acquired more  responsi› bilities  with  the  addition of chemical  security  evaluations. In  No› vember  1981,  the  Vice Chief  of  Staff  directed DCSOPS  and  The Inspector General to  monitor more  closely  management of  the chemical  security programs of  the  major  commands. To  accom› plish  this, DAIG  would monitor and evaluate inspections and

their  results.  The  agency  would  also evaluate  the  management of all organizations with chemical  security  or support responsibilities. DCSOPS  would  have  overall  management responsibility for  the Chemical  Security  Program and  would  establish  standards.

In  summary,  during fiscal year  1982, The  Inspector General's office  and  agency  underwent a  fundamental change in  inspec› tion  philosophy, completing the move  from  a  compliance to  a systemic  approach. This  change resulted from  studies  of  IG  in› formation flow and  of the  effect  of Army  systems  on  each  other. Additionally, two  new  divisions were  created to  accommodate the  change,  and  the  systemic  approach was adapted to the  opera› tions  of  all  other DAIG  divisions.

## Management  Information  Systems

VIABLE (Vertical Installation Automation Baseline), is  an Armywide  effort  to obtain  modern and  efficient  automated data processing (ADP)  equipment to  replace existing 1960s  technol› ogy  based  on  obsolete IBM 360s.  It  will significantly reduce the time  needed to  process forty or  more functional management information systems of common base support operations (BASOPs).

Col. Clinton  H.  Black, the  U.S. Army  Computer Systems Com› mand Project Manager for VIABLE, announced on 19  April 1982 that  the  Electronics Data  Systems  Corporation (EDSc) had been  awarded the  contract for  designing, developing, and  oper› ating  Project  VIABLE under the  supervision of  his  office.

EDSc received  $16.6  million  for  the  first  year  of  a projected ten-year, $600  million  contract that  will revolutionize the  Army's automated data  processing capabilities. Initially  it will modernize information processing at  forty-seven installations in  CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Panama with  an  option for twenty-three more  during the  ten-year life  of  the  contract.

Colonel  Black  called  the  project "probably the  largest, most complex automatic data processing program the government has  taken  on." It will give  the  Army  the  same  kind  of  advanced computer technology found in  private industry today  and  will carry  the  Army  into  the  next  decade  technologically. "VIABLE," he said, "is desperately needed  by the  Army  because  data  process› ing  systems  that  now  perform base  support functions are  over› loaded  and  unreliable. We  have  technology that  was  old  in  the late  1960s. It gets  balky  and  is hard to  maintain. We have  diffi› culty  keeping up  with  data processing demands in  peacetime, and  lack  the  technology to  support the  Army  adequate ly during mobilization."

"Project VIABLE will  eliminate not only  the problems we face  today,  but  also  those  in  the  foreseeable future," he  said. "It will  give  the Army  ah  up-to-date, modern system to  process supply,  finance, and  personnel information." This  sophisticated network of computers talking to computers will  replace the Army's  antiquated stand-alone data processing methods. VIA› BLE will enable  any  computer in  the  network to  access  informa› tion  in  any other computer in the network, transferring vital data  immediately wherever it  may  be  needed .

The VIABLE contract represents five  years of  planning, developing , and  testing  begun  under Col.James E. Love-Colonel Black's  predecessor as  project manager-who worked on the program for  four and  a  half  years.  Over  one  hundred top  mili› tary  and  computer experts from  the  U.S.  Army  Computer Sys› tems  Command-where the  VIABLE project management of› fice  is  located-the Army  staff,  and the  major field  commands teamed  up  to  evaluate industry proposals.

In  the  first  phase of  the  evaluation, the  Army  team  reviewed each  proposal to  ensure that it  met the  Army's formally stated needs. This was  phase I, which  began in February 1981  and ended in  June 1981  with  the selection of  two  corporations to proceed to  the  next evaluation phase.

Phase II was  a  live  test in  which the two  computer firms assembled their equipment and demonstrated their ability to meet  or  exceed the  Army's needs.

Last  December 1981,  the  competing firms made their last technical proposals to  the  Army.  This  was  followed  two  months later by  their best and final cost  bids. The Army team used computers to  select  the best  computer system: a  life-cycle  cost model  helped to  determine the  initial  cost  to  buy  as  well  as  the cost  to  operate each system over a  ten- year period, before it selected  EDSC.

Electronics  Data  Systems  Corporation will establish  and  op er› ate  five  government-owned, contractor-operated regional data centers (RDC).  Two  of  these  large-scale processing centers are already in  operation, at  Newington, Virginia, near Fort  Belvoir and  at Nor cross,  Georgia , near  Fort  McPherson . The  other  three will be  located  at  Central State  College,  Killen,  Texas, near  Fort Hood; Radcliff, Kentucky, ne ar  Fort Knox; and Monterey, California, near Fort Ord. The regional centers will  support forty-four distributed processing centers operated by the  Army. Each  system  user  will  have  access  to  large-scale computer soft› ware  packages and  to  data sets  from the  regional centers.

The hardware equipment that will  be  installed under this contract will  come from various manufacturers. Each  regional

data  center will have  powerful computer capabilities multilple Amdahl  470  central processing units, Storage Technology Cor› poration disk  drives and  printers, and  NCR  Comten front-end processors. This  hardware will communicate with  an  IBM  4331 central  processor at  the  local site.  Each  site will have  hundreds of Raytheon terminals supported by  the IBM 4331  computer.

The United States Army Computer Systems Command (USACSC),  the  Army's  central design agency  for  management information systems,  will receive the  first  new  computers. The first IBM 4331  will be delivered to their  computer center  in  Falls Church, Virginia, in  August. The second one, scheduled for September, will  go to their Support Group Lee  at  Fort Lee, Virginia.  These  computer centers will be supported by Regional Data  Center No.  1 at  Newington, Virginia. The  next  three IBM 4331 computers will  be installed at the U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort  McPherson, Georgia; U.S. Army  Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia; and U.S.  Army Health  Services  Command, Fort  Sam  Houston, Texas.  They  will be  supported by  Regional Data Center No. 2,  at Norcross, Georgia. All  five  regional centers and local  sites  will  be  com› pleted and  functioning by mid-1985.

By  the  end  of  fiscal  year 1982  the  VIABLE project was  on schedule, within  budget, and  running very  well.  EDSC  was  re› quired by  its  contr act  to  achieve a  system  reliability level  of  at least 98 percent for  a thirty-day period, but  the  company proved it  had  a  reliability leel  of  over  99  percent.

The  proliferation of  Management Information Systems (MIS) throughout the  Army in the  continental United  States  and  over› seas  has  created a  serious dilemma for action officers at DA Headquarters who  are responsible for the balanced develop› ment  of personnel and  materiel resources required by the  Army force modernization programs. This year the Force Manage› ment Impact Analysis  System  (FMIAS)  was  established, and a mission  element needs statement (MENS)  under the  terms of 0MB  Circular  A-I09andAR18 -l was approved on 25 February.

The  purpose of  FMIAS  is to  provide HQDA  action  officers with  rapid  access to required resource management information to  help  them  assess  the  impact  of  changes  in  the  Army's  person › nel and  equipm ent.  The  basic concept is to  consolidate selected data  elements from  existing  resource management systems  into a single  data  base . A  request for  proposal (RFP)  was released in August,  and  in  September a software  development contract was awarded to  Presearch, Inc.,  of  Arlington, Virginia; the  contract calls  for a  functional description (FD)  by  December 1982  and delivery  of  a  system  design  by  February 1983.

Since  October 1973,  the  Army  has  employed a system  called ELIM-COMPLIP (Enlisted  Loss Inventory Model-Computation of  Manpower Programs Using  Linear Programming) to  reflect the  current enlisted manpower status  of  the  active  Army  and  to project  enlisted manpower variables  seven  years  into  the  future. The  results  are  used  in  budgeting, planning, using  the  training base,  and setting recruitment objectives. Each  year the  Army makes  refinements to  ELIM-COMPLIP that improve enlisted loss  projections and enlisted force management. Although a highly  successful  tool,  ELIM-COMPLIP is limited  because  it actu› ally computes only  the  enlisted force  and  cannot  discriminate by grade  or  military  occupational specialty  (MOS). Officer  computa› tions are done externally and are manually entered into the ELIM-COMPLIP system  so that  they  are  available  for  the  vari› ous  reports the  system  produces. A  five-year project is  under way  to  develop a  more comprehensive system called FORE› CAST-a multilevel, modular, integrated information system which  will enable  projection of  active  Army  and  civilian  strength both  in aggregate terms  and  by grade,  skill, and  unit.  The  system will  provide an  integrated approach for improved planning, programming, and  budgeting and  will improve the  Army's  abil› ity  to  test the  effects of  alternative policies  on  the force .  The system  will  be  able  to  operate under conditions of  peacetime, partial mobilization, full  mobilization, and  demobilization. Dur› ing  fiscal  year 1983,  the  production version of  the MOS-level subsystem should be  completed and placed  in  operation. Con› tracts  will  be  let  next year  to  continue the  development of  the mobilization (enlisted) subsystem  and  the  officer  subsystem  and for  the  budget module  and  the  civilian  subsystem.  These  subsys› tems  are  scheduled to  be  operational between fiscal  years 1983 and 1987. When combined with the existing capabilities of FORECAST, they  will  enable the  Army  both  to  project peace› time  strengths and  to plan  for  and  project  strengths under mobi› lization  conditions.

Development of the  Manpower Evaluation  and  Tracking Sys› tem  (METS)  continued this  year  as  a  management initiative to improve  information available  to  support Army  resources man› agement  and  allocation.  METS  is a three-phase program to moni› tor  the  use  of  manpower resources. It  compares data  from  the Army  manpower, personnel, and  financial accounting systems. This  procedure will allow the  Army  to verify  that  manpower and related dollars are being spent according to  the purposes for which  they  were justified and  authorized. During  phase  I, which was completed in  fiscal  year 1980,  the  essential  system  structure

was established to  demonstrate both  the  feasibility  and  the  capa› bility  of  the  METS project. Part  of  phase II,  completed in  fiscal year 1982,  furnishes data to  manage the  manpower-related re› sources  of  the  total  Army's manned units, including data  for  the active military at the grade and skill  level. When phase II is completed in  fiscal  year 1983,  METS  will  also  provide civilian cost and  work  hour  data  at  the  management level.  During phase III, METS  will be  expanded to  give  automated, remote access  to the  system  by major  commands and  interested agencies. An  up› graded programming system for the United States Army  Re› serve (USAR) became fully operational in fiscal year 1982. This system, entitled ARMPRO, supplies manpower planning, budgeting, and  programming information for  USAR  troop  pro› gram  units  similar  to  that  provided by ELIM - COMPLIP for  the active  Army.

The  Army's  Force  Development Integrated Management Sys› tem  (FORDIMS) is scheduled to  be  fully  operational in  Decem› ber 1983,  while  its  authorization subsystem and  the  budget sys› tem  are  already in  operation.

Technical systems  designing and programming of  the Ver› tical Force Development Management Information System (VFDMIS),  created to  meet  Army  force  and  manpower manage› ment  needs  in  both  peacetime and  wartime, continued through› out  fiscal  year 1982. A three-day walk  through of  the  resources allocation increment was  conducted in June 1982  to  verify  and correct functional requirements documents for  this  addition to the VFDMIS  data base. One hundred personnel from Army staff  agencies  and  all major  commands (MACO Ms) participated. As a result  of  the  System  Development Review,  held  in  Septem› ber 1981,  the product manager was  trying to  solve  two  major problems . The first  one  was  to  find  a way to  provide user  access from  unclassified remote terminals to  a classified data  base  with assistance  from  Intelligence and  Security  Command (INSCOM). The  second  problem was to determine equipment requirements. USACSC  and  United States  Army Communications Command (USACC)  were  both  helping in  this  effort. In  July 1982,  an  in› depth review  of  the  VFDMIS  concept began  as well as an  evalua› tion  of  the  ability  of  the  Vertical Installation Automatic Baseline (VIABLE)  to support the  VFDMIS  requirement. By the  close  of the  reporting period, conclusions had  been  reached confirming the  VFDMIS  concept but  requiring further evaluation and  cost analysis  of  the  use  of  VIABLE by  VFDMIS.

The  VerticalThe Army  Authorization Documents System (VT AADS) and InstallationThe Army Authorization Docu-

men ts System  (IT AADS)  have  been  developed and  operated by USACSC  for  DCSOPS. VT AADS  provides a  management re› porting capability in  addition to  its primary function of  furnish› ing  documentation of  organizational structure and  unit  require› ments as  well  as  authorization for personnel and equipment. Approval and  control of  these  authorizations are  centralized at Headquarters, Department of  the  Army.

IT AADS  was extended to  the  following locations  during fis› cal year  1982:  Fort  Irwin,  California; U.S. Army  Southern Euro› pean  Task  Force,  Vicenza,  Italy;  USA  Depot,  New  Cumberland, Pennsylvania; USA  Depot, Tobyhannah, Pennsylvania; USA Depot,  Anniston, Alabama; USA Depot,  Red  River,  Texas;  USA Depot, Corpus Christi, Texas; and USA  Depot, Sacramento, California.

T AADS  is  currently operational at 17  major commands (VT AADS) and  65 installations (IT AADS),  totaling 82 data  pro› cessing  sites  worldwide. In  the  logistics  area  the  Standard Army Ammunition System Level 3 was successfully  verified  by MACOM representatives and  was installed in  Korea.  The Standard Army Intermediate Level Supply  System-Expanded (SAILS-ABX)  com› pleted its  last extension and was  fully operational at 54  sites Armywide. The Direct Support Level  Standard Supply System continued its  expansion at  the divisional level  and was  success› fully  verified for use  at  nondivisional direct support units on new  van-mounted mini  computers. Development continued on such  systems  as the  Standard Army  Maintenance System  and  the Standard Property Book  System,  which  are  scheduled for  exten› sion  in  the  mid-l  980s.  Major  efforts were  made  by  the  logistics design  centers  to adapt  existing  systems  to incorporate new source data  automation afforded by  bar-code scanning and  to  use  the new data  processing capabilities provided by the  extension of the VIABLE  computers. These computers will  replace out-of-date hardware at  the  major Army  installations.

Another important materiel information system  is the  Decen› tralized Automated Service Support System  (DAS3).  This is  a tactical transportable computer system intended to automate man› ual  operations or upgrade currently automated operations of active  and  reserve component units within the  Combat Service Support (CSS) community. Each  DAS3  will reflect  the  personal› ity of  its particular resident software. A large  variety  of  software applications will address CSS functions of  supply, maintenance, personnel, financial, ammunition, medical, transportation, and port  operation management.

The  first  contract for  the  DAS3  was  let  on  28  April 1979  to the  Management and  Technical Services  Company (MA  TSCO),

a  subsidiary of  General Electric Corporation. Initially fourteen prototypes were  built,  followed  by the  first  production deliveries in December 1980.  There are two  DAS3  configurations cur› rently planned: an A  model and a  B  model. Both include Honeywell  Level 6 Model  4  7 computers and  peripherals mounted in  a  single  35-foot-long semitrailer van.  The two  configurations differ  in the  mix of peripherals, the  amount of computer memory, and  the  inherent communications capability. The  A model,  cur› rently in  production at  a  rate of  six  per month, is intended for non  divisional  use  by direct support and  general support units  as well as by ammunition and  medical  units.  Current plans  call  for the  production of  211  A  models (including the 14 prototypes). The  B model, scheduled to  start deliveries in  October 1983  at  a rate of  four per month, is  intended for  divisions, separate bri› gades,  personnel units, and  Military  Traffic Management Com› mand ports. Four test sets  and 260  production sets  are to  be acquired.

There were  also  major developments in  management infor› mation  systems  of Army  medical  activities  and  installations, which attracted the  attention of  some  nonmedical property accountabil› ity  activities.

During fiscal  year 1981,  efforts were  made  to extend the  re › cently  developed system  change package (SCP)  05  to  the  Army Medical  Department Property Accounting System  (AMEDDPAS). This  package  represented a complete  redesign  of the  AMEDDPAS in order to take  advantage of  state-of-the-art changes  in software design,  to correct major  deficiencies in  the  previous AMEDDPAS programs, and  to  improve the  capabilities of  the  system.  SCP  05 offered a  complete property management package to  include property accounting, centralized visibility, equipment forecasting, automated inventory, and  maintenance management modules.

A total  of  sixty-six  medical  activities,  including both  hospitals and  research and  development activities,  were  transferred to  the AMEDDPAS  system  change package 05.  On-site training was conducted by  teams  from the  U.S.  Army  Health Services  Com› mand  and  the  Medical  Functional Requirements Group of  The Surgeon  General's  Office. In  addition, AMEDDPAS  was extended to  one  nonmedical activity  in  fiscal  year 1981.  In  May  1981  U.S. Army  Western Command (WESTCOM), Fort Shafter, Hawaii, requested implementation of  AMEDDP AS to automate its  prop› erty  management function. In July,  WESTCOM became  the  first nonmedical organization to  install  AMEDDPAS.

SCP  05  was extended to  the  remaining ten  medical  activities that  were  scheduled to  receive the  system . In  September 1982,

the  U.S.  Army  Community Hospital in  Seoul, Korea, changed from a  manual property book  to  the AMEDDPAS.  With  this conversion, all  Army fixed TDA  medical treatment facilities worldwide  were  operating under AMEDDPAS  programs except for the hospitals in  SHAPE, Belgium, and Livorno, Italy. All activities  of  the  Medical  Research and  Development Command had  also  incorporated the AMEDDP AS  to  automate property books.

Because of  its  successful use  at  WESTCOM in fiscal  year 1981,  the  automated inventory capability using bar-code tech› nology,  and the  lack  of  any  other readily available automated property system,  AMEDDP AS grew  in  popularity among  other major  Army  commands. During the  year,  the  system  was imple› mented for the  installation property books  at  Fort McClellan, Fort  Stewart,  and  Fort  Hood; for  the  facility  engineer, bachelor housing, and  family  housing property books  at  Fort  McClellan; and  for  the  U.S.  Army  Japan (USARJ),  the  Southeast Commis› sary  Region  at  Fort  Lee,  and  the  Army Communications Com› mand, Hawaii.  Based  on  the  success  of  the  system,  the  Troop Support Agency (TSA), Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), and USARJ  have  adopted the AMEDDPAS  as  a standard property management system  and  have  made  plans  for full implementation at all  subordinate TDA  activity  property books.

As mentioned above,  the  ability  to perform equipment inven› tories  using  the  kind  of  bar  codes  common in  supermarkets was incorporated in  AMEDDP AS.  The  use  of  bar  coding  to  inven› tory property assets had been first investigated by  OTSG in 1978,  and a  decision was  made to  integrate the  technology in AMEDDPAS  in the  next  major  systems  change  package.  Devel› opment  of this concept  was coordinated with  the  DO D's steering group for Logistics Applications of  Automated Marking and Reading  Symbols  (LOGMARS),  formed in  1976  to  identify and standardize bar-code  applications. The  idea  behind  an  automated inventory is  that each  item  of  equipment is  assigned a  unique control  number in  the  AMEDDPAS  data  base  and  affixed  with  a label  containing the  number in  bar-code configuration .  A  pro› grammable bar-code reading device  is used  to scan  and  store  the number on  each  piece  of  equipment within  a  given  area . The collected  data  is then  transferred to a computer over  a telephone .  line  where it is processed against  the  AMEDDP AS data  base  and a  listing  is  generated to  provide managers with  a  report of  the results.  This  bar-code application is used  not  only  in the  govern› ment but  in  the  commercial sector  as well.

A test  to  determine the  savings,  if any,  offered by the  inven› tory  of  property using  bar-code technology versus  conventional methods was  conducted at  the Fort Stewart, Georgia, Medical Department Activity in March  1981. The  results  of the  test showed an  average time reduction of  67  percent using the bar-code concept.  In  addition, data  collection  was more  accurate, and  per› sonnel  with  less  experience in  property management could  be used  to  conduct inventories.

Action  to extend  bar-code  inventory  to three  additional sites› the  Armed Forces  Institute of Pathology (AFIP),  the  Fort  Camp› bell  Medical Department Activity, and Brooke Army  Medical Center-was begun in  fiscal  year 1982.

Close  coordination continued with  the  LOGMARS  steering group. Equipment and ancillary supplies and services for all Department of  the  Army  bar-code applications were  procured through the DOD  Productivity Incentive Funds (PIF). As  an adjunct to  this,  centralized procurement was  recommended as the  best  way  to  obtain the  economies of  a  large purchase .  To support this  action, AMEDDPAS  requirements and  equipment specifications  were  prepared and  presented to  the  steering  group so the  procurement action  could  be started as close as possible  to the  release of  fiscal  year 1983  PIF  money.

A prototype system  for  electronically transmitting supply  or› ders from hospitals in Europe to  commercial suppliers in  the United  States was developed with  the  cooperation of the  Defense Logistics  Agency  and the  U.S.  Air  Force.  The system  relies  on electronic processing of  purchase requests through the  military worldwide  communication network  to a transfer site in the  United States.  At  this  site,  the  message is automatically switched  to  the commercial  teletype  network  and  sent  direct  to the  supplier. The supplier ships  the materiel directly to  the requesting overseas unit,  using  either  commercial transportation or  the  DOD  system, as appropriate . At  the  same  time,  the  supplier electronically ad› vises the  customer unit  of  the  action  taken on  its  supply order.

In  the  area  of  military  operations the  major  emphasis  was on the  Military  Computer Family  (MCF),  a project  to  develop  stan› dard  embedded automated data  processing equipment (ADPE). Development contracts were  awarded to  four contr actors:  Gen › eral  Electric-TRW, RCA, Raytheon, and  IBM.  The  IBM  Corpo› ration  experienced cost increases  and  project  delays, which caused its  contract to  be  terminated by  the  Army.  The  remaining con› tractors were  on  schedule and  within  budget allotments .

MCF was being  developed in  accordance with  DOD  Instruc› tion  5000.5X, Standard Set  Architecture for Embedded Com-

puters. A congressional review  raised  issues  about the  impact  of the  concepts  in the  policy:  (1) the  policy  could  lock DOD  into  the use  of  inferior technology, (2)  DOD  might not  be  able  to  take advantage of  industry's technological innovations, and (3)  the policy  would  restrict competition. The  Army  decided the  MCF could  continue  without  DOD  Instruction 5000.SX.  However,  Con› gress  requested OSD  to  conduct a study  during fiscal  year 1983 to  determine the  following: applicability of  commercial off-the› shelf  technology to  defense missions; available standardization alternatives and their cost  and impact on  software portability; potential for  functional standardization across  military services; and  plans  to  reduce computer proliferation.

The responsibilities of  the  Army Automation Security Pro› gram  (AASP) were  expanded in September by the  Defense  Intel› ligence  Agency  to  include reaccreditation of  contractor sites  op› erating highly  classified systems . This  process  gives  the  Army  a visibility at all of  these  sites,  which  the  Assistant  Chief  of Staff  for Intelligence (ACSI)  did  not  have  before. Accreditation of  Tele› communications Centers (TCC)  operated by the  Army  became  a reality with  the  accreditation in  April of  the TCC  in  Vicenza, Italy.  Both these  activities reflect continued growth and  accep› tance  of the  AASP,  thus  increasing confidence that  these  systems are  capable of  processing classified information as  designed.

OACSI  participated in  developing the  charter for  the  DOD Computer Security  Center. This  involvement is important since the  center will have  long-range impact  upon  the  Army 's security programs, especially in the critical area of  multilevel security and  development of  security standards.

OACSI  continued as  a  member of  the  Quadripartite Work› ing  Group on  Automation Interoperability of  the American, British, Canadian, and  Australian (ABCA)  armies.  Participation included writing a  Category III concept paper entitled "Impact of  Technology on  Security  Aspects  of  Automated Tactical  Com› mand  and  Control  Systems"  and  a Quadripartite Standing  Agree› ment  entitled "Principles and  Characteristics of  Interoperability Security." These documents formed the  foundation of  security for  ABCA  tactical  command and  control systems .

AASP resource  management improved  with a decision  in April by the  Army  Select  Committee to  establish a  Program Develop› ment  Increment Package (PDIP)  for  automation security func› tions.  This  action  will provide visibility  over  all resource require› ments  for  the  AASP.

The  replacement of  obsolete automated data  processing sys› tems  by  Project VIABLE  and  FORECAST was  followed  by  the

initiation of  a  similar program for revitalizing the  Worldwide Military  Command and  Control  System  (WWMCCS).  WWMCCS is  the composite of  command and control center facilities; se› lected  warning systems;  automated data  processing facilities;  in› terconnecting voice, record, and data communications; and procedures, displays, and people that provide the means for command of  military forces-from the  national command au› thorities  to the  military  commanders. The  WWMCCS automated data  processing (ADP) program involves  data  collection  and  pro› cessing  capabilities  within  the  Army's  WWMCCS  facilities.  These ADP systems  have  been  in place,  with  some  improvements, since the  early 1970s.  The first steps have  been taken to  develop a mission  element  needs  statement, or  the  equivalent definition, of the  overall  requirements to  replace this  equipment with  ADPE, based  on  today's  more  advanced and  sophisticated data  process› ing  technology.

## Financial  Management

Although Congress  is supposed to enact  appropriations legis› lation before a  fiscal  year begins, it  has  a  long history of  not doing  so. The Army's  fiscal  year 1982  appropriations were  no exception. The  fiscal  year  1982  Defense  Appropriation Act was not  passed  until 29  December 1981, almost  three months after fiscal  year 1982  officially  began (  1  October 1981  ).  During this time  a  continuing resolution authority (CRA)  served  as  an  in› terim  measure  until  fiscal year  1982 Defense  appropriations were passed . The  CRA  delayed  Army  spending by keeping  it at  fiscal 1981 levels and  by placing  a hold  on  hew  starts.  On  10 Septem› ber  1982, the  Military  and  Civilian  Pay Supplemental was passed, completing the  appropriation for  fiscal  year 1982.

Table  8 is expressed in terms  of current  authorized obligations, while the  Army's  actual  expenditures include  obligations  incurred in previous  fiscal years.  Overall  obligation  performance was good. The obligation shortfall occurred because a  portion of the planned program supplemental was not  received. Outlays  were within  the  acceptable range. The  total  variance  was attributed to either not  receiving the program supplemental or  receiving it too  late,  to  reprogramming actions  which  were  not  in the  budget, to  favorable foreign currency fluctuations, and  to  deobligations and  obligation shortfalls during much  of  the  year .

While  simultaneously closing  out  fiscal year  1982,  the  Direc› tor  of the  Army  Budget, Brig.  Gen.  Harold]. Davis,Jr., issued  a statement on  30  September explaining the  status  of  the  Army's

fiscal  year 1983 appropriations bill.  The Senate  Appropriations Committee reduced the Army budget request by  almost $4 billionfrom $58.5  billion  to  $54. 7  billion, or  by  6.5  percent. Despite  this  large  reduction, the  Senate's  approved funding level for  fiscal  year 1983 exceeds  the  current fiscal  year 1982 budget by  almost $3.5  billion, or 5.8  percent. Only  the Ammunition Procurement Appropriation showed  a decrease compared to fis› cal  year 1982  levels.  The appropriations showing the greatest percent reduction from  the  requested amount included Aircraft Procurement (-11.0 percent); Procurement of  Weapons and Tracked Combat  Vehicles  (  11.5 percent); Procurement of  Am› munition (-19.4 percent); and RDTE (-14.8 percent). The Authorization Joint Conference reductions of Cooperhead and  chemical  ammunition and  the  Senate  Appropriations Com› mittee decision not to fund the Viper were major factors in the severe 19.4  percent overall reduction in ammunition procurement.

In fiscal year 1982,  three new  accounts were established: an  Army  procurement appropriation for  National Guard  equip› ment; a  revolving fund, the Army  Conventional Ammunition Working Capital Fund, which  was created to  finance the  manu› facture and  sale  of  conventional ammunition; and  an  allocation received  from  DOD  for  research into  infectious disease  in  India. These three funds increased the  number of  accounts managed by  the  Army  to  forty-four.

Effective with  fiscal  year 1982  the Operations and Mainte› nance  accounts were  subject to  review  and  approval by  the  re-

spective  armed services  committee (authorization process)  in ad› dition to  the House and  Senate appropriation committees.

Execution performance data was  added to the Planning, Programming, and  Budgeting System  (PPBS).  The  amended pro› cess is retitled the  Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and  Exe› cution  System  (PPBES).  The  initiation of quarterly reviews,  called the  Program Performance and  Budget Execution Review  System (PPERS),  enabled the  Army  staff  to  make  better functional assess› ments  of  program and  budget execution data.

A Special  Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF)  was  established by  DOD. Foreign Military Sales (FMS)  proceeds for one-time costs  (for  example, non-recurring costs  and asset  use  charges), formerly turned over  to the  U.S.  Treasury, are  now  being  depos› ited  into  the  SDAF  and  will be  used  to  begin  procurement action in  anticipation of  FMS  customer requirements.

In support of the President's program to  eliminate waste throughout the  entire federal government, the  Army  established and  implemented the  Economies, Efficiencies, and  Management Improvement (EEMI)  program as well as the  Debt  Management Plan. The EEMI  aim  is  to  capture bona fide auditable savings from actions taken to streamline operations thereby reducing costs. Money saved can then be  used to finance priority, un› funded requirements Armywide. The Debt Management Plan called for an  aggressive attempt to  identify all  monies owed  to the  Army  and  to  improve the  rate of  collections. The Office of Management and Budget (0MB) directed that the Army im› prove  this  rate by  $12.5 million, which  the  Army has  done.

The  Army's  major  commands have  been  developing plans  to carry  out  the  EEMI  program. For  example, TRADOC  has estab› lished Project SPIRIT (Systematic Productivity Improvements Review  in  TRADOC), which consolidates the management of many  current activities in  such areas as  manpower and equip› ment  surveys;  waste,  fraud, and  abuse;  energy conservation; and capital  investment. DARCOM's  Resource Self-Help and  Afford› ability Planning Effort (RESHAPE) is  aimed at  increasing the productivity of  the  work force by  using initiatives such  as  care› fully  monitored overtime and  overhire, capital investment, and profit sharing. FORSCOM  has  been  advancing the  Army's  Sum› mary  Level  Standards Program and  plans  to complete standards for  all  functions of  the  Directorate of  Industrial Operations by the  end of  calendar year 1982.

A  new  data base, Force Modernization Reporting System (FORMS),  is in  use  at  major Army  commands accumulating and reporting operation and support costs  by  weapons systems  for the  Army's Force  Modernization Program.

In  fiscal  year 1982,  25  percent of  the  profits from  the  sale  of lumber and  timber products on  military installations was turned over  to the  states  by theArmy. Beginning in  fiscal  year 1983,  the Army  will be DO D's executive  agent  for  the  Lumber and  Timber Products Program.

The  Army  Procurement Appropriation module of  the Pro› gram  Budgeting Accounting System  (PBAS) became  operational in  fiscal  year 1982.  This first of  fourteen PBAS  modules was  a major step toward increasing the  ability  of  the Comptroller of the  Army  to  respond to  Army  staff  requests for  financial data.

In response to  Secretary of Defense Weinberger's call  for substantial reductions, the  Army in February 1981 identified the following  as areas  in which  significant savings  could  be achieved: procurement; consolidation and  realignment of  functions; distri› bution and  use  of  manpower training; statutory and  regulatory reform to  permit, for  example, multiyear contracting; manage› ment in  such areas as  transportation and logistics; and capital investments that improve productivity.

A framework for  the  identification, integration, and  improve› ment  of  cost  savings  activities  was  announced in  an  HQDA ac› tion  plan  issued in  December 1981.  In  approving the  plan, the Chief  of  Staff  encouraged the  entire Army  community-active, National Guard, Army  Reserve, civilian  employees, and  family members-to develop a  positive cost-saving attitude. The plan makes  the  Comptroller of  the Army  responsible for managing the  documentation and integration of  savings data into Army planning, programming, budgeting, and  execution processes.

The Army  is  expanding its  proven Capital Investment and Value  Engineering programs. Returns on  investment of between ten  to one  and  fifteen  to one  have  been  realized  in these  programs. Pursuant to DOD guidance, the Army  is  planning to  conduct efficiency reviews  of  all  in-house activities that are not  studied under the  Commercial Activities  (CA) program. This  will involve on-site  evaluations of  processes, procedures, organization struc› tures, missions, functions, resources, facilities, and equipment to identify means to improve operations, performance, and efficiency.

ITur1ng  fiscal  year 1982,  the Capital Investment programs have  continued to  serve  as major  pillars  in  the  Army's  Economies, Efficiencies, and Management Improvement program. Invest› ments  of  $33  million  approved under the  Quick  Return on  In› vestment Program (QRIP) and OSD  Productivity Investment Funding (PIF) are expected to  result in savings and benefits exceeding $330  million during the  economic life  of  the equip-

ment.  Many  administrative accomplishments have  also been  made regarding new  policies  and procedures for  decentralized fund› ing  and transferral of  project approval authority to  the com› mand  level, which  will become  effective  in fiscal year  1983.  Fiscal year 1982  also  marked the first year  in  which  total  integration of  the Capital Investment programs into the Planning, Pro› gramming, and  Budgeting System  (PPBS)  was achieved through the  Command Operating Budget (COB)  and  Program Analysis Resources Review  (PARR).

Value  Engineering (VF.) savings  increased from  $391  million in  fiscal  year 1981  to  $457 million in  fiscal  year 1982.  Savings from  the  approval of  1,311  in-house VE  proposals produced an estimated one-year net  savings  or  cost  avoidance of  $396  million, and the approval of  426  contractor VE  change proposals re› sulted  in savings  of  $61.5  million.  The  overall  return investment from VE  actions in  fiscal  year 1982  was  thirty dollars for  each dollar invested. A  proposal was  developed and  approved to  im› plement VE  Armywide.

The implementation of  Office of  Management and Budget (0MB) Circular A-76 continued during the year. During the second quarter, 0MB revised this circular to  allow  the use  of simplified costing  procedures. This  alternative method helps  re› duce  the  time  it takes  to complete cost studies. 0MB has  started a total  revision  of Circular A-76,  which  is expected to be published during fiscal  year 1983.

At the  current rate  of  progress, the  Army  cannot  complete all required cost  studies by the  end  of  fiscal  year  1985,  the  deadline set by 0MB.  Several  factors  slowed  the  execution of this  program. These included congressional concerns and legislative actions, overly protective policies with respect to  commercial activities and  small business  program interfaces, not  enough people  trained in A-76  and  Army  acquisition procedures, rapid turnover of  key personnel, and  too  many  cost  studies  undertaken simultaneously. These  issues  and  others are  being  addressed by the  Commercial Activities Division  as organizational objectives  for  fiscal year  1983.

The  Deputy Secretary of  Defense issued three directives on how  to  structure CA  packages for cost  study. On 15  October 1981,  guidance indicated that  these  activities  should be  set  up  to take  full  advantage of  the  potential to  contract them  out  under the  A-76 program and to  pursue aggressively strategies to  im› prove contracting, consolidation, and productivity. The Army responded by consolidating commercial activities  whenever logi› cal  and practical to  meet the requirements of  the installations concerned. Where consolidations were  made, prospective con-

tractors were  required to submit  subcontracting plans  along  with their  proposals to ensure that  small  business  received  a fair  share of  contract dollars spent. On  17 April 1982,  the  Deputy Secre› tary  of  Defense stated  that  his use  of  the  word consolidation in  his 15 October 1981 memorandum did  not  mean  that  he  endorsed total  base-services  contracts to the  extent that  small  and  disadvan› taged businesses were precluded from competition as  prime contractors. This  clarification allowed  the  Army  to proceed with its  strategy of  using a  balanced program. On  1 June 1982,  the Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  directed the  armed services  to pack› age  future solicitations so as not  to  preclude small  and  disadvan› taged  concerns as  prime contractors. This  major  change in  pol› icy caused the  Army to  restructure its  cost  studies planned for fiscal  year 1984 and  to  request that  OSD  restore the  manpower spaces  previously programmed as anticipated savings  from  com› mercial activities cost  studies .  An ad  hoc  committee has  been established by  the Assistant Secretary of  the Army  for  Instal› lations, Logistics, and Financial Management (IL&amp;FM)  to  de› velop  a  policy  which  will enable the  Army  to  accomplish all  CA effectively and efficiently and still accommodate the goals  of both  the  commercial activities  and small  business programs.

The  fiscal year 1983 Defense  Authorization Act,  PL  97-252, made  certain changes to  the  commercial activities  program. Sec› tion  305 placed  a six-month limited  moratorium on  the  initiation of  new  cost  studies (those  which  had  not  been  announced to  the Congress before 1 October 1982).  Section 1111  set  a  one-year prohibition against entering into new  contracts for  firefighters and security guards during fiscal  year 1983.  Section 1112  re› moved  cost study  notification requirements for  commercial  activi› ties  with  ten or  fewer DOD  civilian  employees and eliminated these  requirements entirely during mobilization.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  completed 70 cost  studies of in-house  activities:  39 of  these  studies  showed  in-house perfor› mance  to be the  most  advantageous method,  and  31 studies  found contracting to  be  most  cost  effective for  the government. As  a result of  these decisions, 1,070  civilian  spaces  and 188  military spaces  were released for other Army  requirements. These ac› tions  will also  result in  estimated savings  to  the  government of approximately $37.2  million  over  the  next  three years.

In  April 1980  the  Logistics  Division,  Office  of  The Surgeon General,  began  action  to  protect  certain  active duty  enlisted  medi› cal  specialists from being reviewed under the CIT A  program. Studies indicated that even  if  all  such actions were protected, there would  still be  shortages in  certain medical  specialties. An-

other complication is that  all  medical TOEs  are  being  revised to increase the  amount and  sophistication of equipment assigned to field medical units. This will  result in  increasing the require› ments for specialists trained to maintain the equipment. The Assistant Secretary of  the  Army (IL&amp;FM)  has  already approved the  exemption of  medical logistics personnel from CITA cost› based  reviews.

The  Army  Audit  Agency  issued  several  reports covering  prob› lems  found at  various installations. Actions on  the  audit report recommendations should result in  improved management of  re› sources  at all levels  of command. The  agency  made  the  following observations:

- a. Maximum benefits were not being realized from opera› tional  tests  of  nonmajor materiel systems  because of  conflicting test  and acquisition responsibilities.
- b. New  organizational clothing and individual equipment items  were  being introduced into the  Army  supply system  that did  not  fully  meet  the  user's  requirements or  were  not  tailored to actual needs.
- c. Logistical planning for  postmobilization repair parts sup› port in Europe was  outdated and did not reflect changes in troop strengths or  equipment types  and  densities.
- d. Army  policy  concerning female  soldiers  in combat  did  not fully  recognize the  geographic extent expected in  modern war› fare  or  the  use  of  noncombat units in  combat areas.
- e. Army  finance and accounting offices were  not  following cash  management policies intended to  produce significant sav› ings in interest.
- f. Improvements were needed in planning for personnel, training, product improvement, and logistics support for the Improved Hawk  missile  system.
- g. Significant  savings  were  possible  by consolidating and  elimi› nating mail  transportation routes in  Europe.
- h. Acquisition of  medical care support equipment for new facilities  was  not justified on  the  basis  of  historical workload and the  population to  be  served.
- i. Improvements in  real  property management were  needed to reduce the  backlog  of  maintenance and  repair and  to  improve the  soldiers' living,  working, and  training conditions.
- j. Enlisted replacement personnel arriving in  Europe were not assigned to  the subordinate commands that needed them most.

The  Army  Audit  Agency  issued  advisory  reports to  field  com› manders concerning civilian  pay,  medical management, reserve

component operations, club  systems,  and  installation  contracting. The  common  problems discussed  in these  advisory  reports were within  the  means  of  installation commanders to correct or  avoid through intensive management.

The  Army  Audit Agency  also  reviewed ninety-six commer› cial  activity  cost  comparisons. The reviews  identified the  need for  extensive  adjustments to initial  estimates  of government costs used to  decide whether to  perform activities in  house or by contracts.  These  reports helped  ensure that  decisions  were  based on  realistic  cost  estimates.

The  Army  Audit  Agency,  together with  other investigation, inspection, and  audit groups, examined the  potential for  fraud in  the Army  and Air Force Exchange Service. Their reviews resulted in indictments and  convictions  of Exchange Service  offi› cials  and vendors. Procurement prices  were  analyzed to  gather audit  evidence  for  fraud detection.  When  significant  unexplained price  fluctuations were  found, audit  results  were  passed  to inves› tigative  agencies.

## Records and Publications  Management

Closely  related to  Project VIABLE  is another ADPS  project under The  Adjutant General, announced by  the  ASA  (IL&amp;FM) in  September, called  the  Installation Integrated Administrative Support System  (IIADSS).  A product manager office  will direct the  development, standardization, and  management of automated administrative systems at Army  installations and will  prepare standard documentation of  several labor-saving software pack› ages  already  in use,  including post  locator,  separation and  trans› fer  paperwork, military personnel office  support, and  publica› tions  management.

The  Adjutant General along  with  the  Soldier  Support Center has  sponsored a  project this  year  called  Personnel and  Adminis› tration Concept  Evolution (PACE)  to automate selected  adminis› trative functions at Fort Lewis,  Washington, through use of microcomputers, telecommunications, and  an  administrative sup› port  computer. The purpose of  PACE  is to  develop the  use  of automated support systems  in  Army  divisions.

This year the Administrative Management Directorate of T AGO  sponsored a  project to  upgrade the  administrative sup› port systems  of  Army Civilian  Personnel Offices (CPOs).  The survey  included a detailed requirements analysis  of  Army  CPOs in  the  Washington area,  a comprehensive study  of  the  U.S. Army Civilian  Personnel Center, and  the  design  of model  offices  in the

field. Requirements for data processing, micrographics, word processing, and  communications equipment were  established in a nine-volume report. By the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  most  of  the equipment had  been  installed in  the  Washington offices,  and a project  team  was designated for  worldwide implementation. The Army  requested $22 .5 million  in fiscal year  1984 funds  for  7,000 items  of  equipment through Productivity Improvement Funds, discussed earlier. Savings  and  benefits will be  almost  $100  mil› lion  in  time,  paper, and  postage.

The  Adjutant General in December 1981 briefed the  Reserve Components Coordination Council  on  the  status  of  the  effort to reduce the  administrative workload. At  the  1981  Division  Com› manders Conference, attending division  commanders requested that  the  Reduction of  Administrative Workload Program be  ex› tended to  the  active  Army.  Their request was approved by The Adjutant General, and  surveys  were  conducted in  1982 to deter› mine  the  extent to which  administrative publications, forms,  and reports were interfering with the efforts of  active Army  and reserve component unit commanders to  train personnel and maintain equipment. Based  on  the  findings of  these and  other published surveys, a  concept paper outlining The Adjutant General's plan  to institute a program to control the  proliferation of administrative requirements on  company-,  battery-,  and  troop› level commanders was presented first  to  the  Personnel Program Review  Committee (PPRC)  and  then to  the  Army  staff  agencies and  major  Army  commands for  review  and  concurrence.

In July  and  September 1982,  briefings that  elaborated on  the concept were  conducted at  most stateside and overseas major Army  commands. A  baseline report study on  the number of Department of  the Army  publications distributed to  unit-level commanders was prepared, published, and  furnished to the Army Reserve  Forces  Policy  Committee. This  baseline report will also be  presented to  the  Reserve Components Coordination Council in  December 1982.  Proliferation of  administrative publications will be  monitored, and  decreases will be  determined annually by comparing future inventories with  the  baseline report. Evalua› tions of these findings will  be furnished to the individuals concerned .

In June 1982 a student study  at the  Army  War  College  evalu› ated the manpower impact, procurement cost, and practical (publishing) considerations of the Department of the Army's system  for  issuing printed regulatory guidance to  small  units. The study found that the publications system  resulted in  slow communications for  Army  policy  makers  and  a heavy  manpower

burden on  small  units. It  included persuasive evidence that us› ing  alternative publishing techniques would speed up printed communications and  would  sharply  cut  red  tape  without exceed› ing  existing cost  levels.

In  lieu  of the  Army's  standard page  replacement or  pen-and› ink  change processes, the  study  endorsed adoption of  informa› tion  service  techniques used  in  industry. These techniques build on  electronic typesetting to  assimilate changes directly into an established body  of  text.  Updated text  is then furnished to  sub› scribers periodically as  throw-away publications. This method requires no  processing by the  user  to  make  the  new  information understandable.

Having participated as  adviser for the War  College paper, the  Director of  Army  Publications invited the  study's  author, Lt. Col.  R. F. Milwee, Jr.,  an  Army  reservist, to  work  with  the  Publi› cations  Directorate in  developing an  information service  publica› tion  demonstration using  the  strategy  recommended in  the  paper. Actual  work  began on  28 June 1982.

Sixteen  personnel regulations published by the  Reserve  Com› ponent Personnel and Administration Center were  selected to make  ·up a  test volume. Arrangements were made to  use an electronic text-editing demonstration for  electronically creating updated copy.  With  the  close  cooperation and  assistance of  the Government Printing Office's Superintendent of  Procurement, printing specifications were developed for a  product that will compare in  every  way to current sophisticated commercial infor› mation service  publications-including their systemic  efficiency and the economy which their production characteristics make possible, together with  a  production schedule guaranteed by  a large  bond not  to  exceed five  days.

The  cover  date  for  the  first  volume has  been  set for  1 Decem› ber 1982.  Everything has  been digitized, a  dramatically more efficient copy  layout  has  been  developed, and  every  other mile› stone  has  been  successfully reached. Estimates from  the  Govern› ment  Printing Office  indicate that the  average page  cost  for  the prototype Update publications will be  less  than 25  percent of  the cost  the  Army now  pays  for  standard format publications. En› tered as  second-class mail, projected postal rates will  be  about one-third of  the  usual  mailing costs,  though faster handling will be  received. Composition tests  indicate that two  pages of  stan› dard format copy  will  fit  on a  single new-style page-without impairing  readability, according to scientifically  proven  indicators. If  this  savings  is verified when  the  text  of  all sixteen regulations has been  composed, the  potential for  more  savings  in composition, printing, and  postage costs  will be  demonstrated.

Considering the  needs  of Army  policy makers,  it is important to note  that  the  complete publishing and  production cycle of this prototype Udale publication is limited to  a  single  month. Initial data  base creation is not  included. Such  a turnaround would  save about  80 percent of  the  time  now  consumed in  the  processing of standard printed communications. In this light, the ultimate promise  offered by the  demonstration is to reestablish a printing option  for  routine handling of  urgent communications that  origi› nate  at  the  Department of  the  Army  level.

To  provide low-cost  written documents to  the  soldier in  the field,  T AGO  is  concentrating its  efforts on  making microfiche documents, which  will replace  bulky  paper documents and  pro› vide  additional space  for  storage of  other publications.

The  current DA Form  12-series  that  is used  to project  which publications the  units  in the  field  will need  to receive  is an  area  of major  concern to T AGO.  The  many  forms  that  need  to be  filled out  by  a  unit are  complex and require extraordinary effort to complete  and  maintain . The  project  to improve  the  12-series  was instituted to  streamline operations, to  make  the  process  for  ob› taining new  publications easier to  understand, and to  provide timely  service.  Once  improvements have  been  made,  they  will be fully  tested before being  released to  the  field.

The Publications Center at  Baltimore began a  multimillion dollar warehouse modernization program which  is expected to be completed in  fiscal  year 1986.  The  job  of  storing and  issuing test  materials and accountable blank forms was  transferred to the  St.  Louis  Publications Center, making it  the sole  source of supply  for  those  items.  In  response to  complaints from  employ› ees  at  the Baltimore Publications Center about poor working conditions in areas  where  packing  equipment and  storage  pallets were  involved, people and equipment were moved to  a  light industrial area within the  center's warehouse where there was better lighting and air  conditioning. At  a  cost  of  $250,000 the center's 1.  7-mile  conveyor system  was modernized. This  has  im› proved the center's packaging system, eliminated equipment maintenance problems, reduced complaints, and  provided addi› tional  storage space  within  the  warehouse.

Personnel at  the St.  Louis Publications Center have  devel› oped  a method of  providing faster  initial  distribution of publica› tions  through the  use  of  microcomputer technology .  They are obtaining a  robotlike machine controlled by  a  microcomputer which  would  determine the  kind  and  amount of  publications to be  sent  to  a customer . The robot  would  pick  up  the  customer's order, place  it  in  an  envelope, and send  it  through the  postal

system.  A  robotlike Bell  and Howell  machine coupled with  an Apple  microprocessor has  been selected, and  the  system  should be  fully  operational within a  year.

The  Adjutant General Center's Publications Directorate has completed the  first phase  of  its  micropublishing program. Dur› ing  this  phase, high standards and quality specifications were developed for  Department of  the  Army  microfiche publications and  procedures, and  means  for  producing them  efficiently were generated. During the  same  period, 735  publications were  pro› duced and distributed in microfiche, including regulations, circulars, pamphlets, supply  catalogs,  and  technical bulletins and manuals.  They  were  distributed at a cost of  $5.1  million.  It  would have  cost  $28.7 million to  print and  distribute them on  paper. These publications are more quickly and easily produced, updated, revised, and  mailed  than  their  paper counterparts. On the  average, distribution time  is cut  by  two-thirds.

The  Editorial Control Division  continued its  program to  im› prove  readability and  limit  the  size  of  new  Army  administrative publications while  reducing the  number of  existing publications. Efforts to  improve readability resulted in reducing the overall reading grade levels  of  publications from an  average of 18  to 11.4. Through editing, over  1,000  pages  were  deleted from  new publications issued  by HQDA; also,  sixty-seven  Armywide publi› cations  were  either consolidated with  other publications or  were eliminated entirely.

Installation of an  electronic printing system  was completed in January 1982. Thirteen standard photocomposition formats  were developed and tested for Army  administrative publications. A standard locator code  structure for  these  formats was created to minimize  coding  and  data  entry  and  to enable  the  data  base  to be moved  easily  from  one  vendor to  another or  to  the  Government Printing Office  if  required. In  addition, documentation was de› veloped  to help  new  users  understand the  system.  Formal  opera› tor  training courses  were  conducted for  the  employees. Adminis› trative  procedures and  records for  processing manuscripts under the  new  system  were  also developed and  documented. The  devel› opment phase of  the project was  completed on  20  September 1982,  and  the  production phase of  the  test,  which  will take  two years  to  complete, was  begun.

## Logistics

In  September 1977,  when  Secretary of  the  Army  Clifford L. Alexander, Jr., and  Chief  of  Staff  Bernard W.  Rogers  first  pre› pared the  statement "Total  Army  Goals,"  they  defined the  mate› riel goal  as  "developing, fielding, and maintaining a  balanced warfighting and  sustaining capability."  In  the  context  of  the  times, with  the  Army  aware  of  the  need to  modernize the  force struc› ture but  with  the  new  generation of  weapons and  support sys› tems  still  largely on  the  drawing boards and  even  the  most  ad› vanced ones not yet  in  the tactical units, the emphasis of  the materiel goal  on just obtaining equipment was  understandable. By  December 1981  when the Secretary of  the Army,  John 0. Marsh,  Jr., and the Chief of  Staff, General Edward C.  Meyer, issued  the  current statement "Total Army  Goals,"  much  of  the new  equipment had  begun to  arrive in  the  field.  Consequently, the  emphasis of  the  materiel goal  shifted from  obtaining equip› ment  to using  it. The  reworked goal  simply  said:  "A Total  Army equipped and  sustained to  win  any  land  battle."

At  the  end  of  the 1982  fiscal  year  General Meyer  noted  that the  Army  still faced  serious problems in  the  logistics  area. Some units  lacked the  equipment called for  in  their tables  of  organi› zation.  The  introduction of new  systems  had  only begun  in  198,2. Eventually  the  Army  would  have  to  field  583  new  systems,  a task "guaranteed to  tax  the  imagination, innovation, and  patience of the  entire Army." Finally, he  noted that, while  the  Army had made  great strides in  the  past  few  years,  maintenance manage› ment  remained a problem. Army  maintenance was, he  observed, a  "laborious, paper-intensive system." In 1982  the  Army  found no  final  solutions to  these problems or  related ones, but  it  did make  considerable progress toward achieving the  materiel goal as  set  forth by  Secretary Marsh  and  General Meyer.

## Management  and Planning

The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (ODCSLOG)  last  published DA  Pamphlet 701-1, "Direction of Army  Logistics  (DIALOG)," in January 1981. Early  in  fiscal year 1982 the  office  discontinued it.  Lt.  Gen.  Richard H.  Thompson, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (DCSLOG), provided

broad  direction for  Army  logistics, previously  found  in DIALOG, in  an  ODCSLOG white  paper entitled "Logistics  Directions for the  l 980's."  Published in  April 1982,  it identified and  discussed nine logistics  objectives that supported the seven  Total Army goals  outlined by  the Secretary of  the Army  and  the  Chief  of Staff on 7  December 1981.  General Thompson incorporated specific  projects  and  actions,  called  thrust items,  previously iden› tified for  the  ODCSLOG staff  in  DIALOG into  an  ODCSLOG Performance Management Program based  on  the  nine  DCSLOG objectives.  As of the  end  of the  fiscal year,  the  program consisted of  a  series  of  initiatives not  yet  codified into  a  single  document.

In  March 1982 the  Chief  of  Staff  appointed General  Thomp› son as co-lead  agent  with  the  Assistant  Secretary of the  Army  for Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management, Joel E. Bonner,.Jr., for  the  Total Army  materiel goal  under the  Perfor› mance Management, Army, program. They were responsible for  identifying objectives, determining tasks, and setting mile› stones to support the goal. At  the end of fiscal year 1982, ODCSLOG  was in  the  process  of  specifying the  tasks  necessary to ensure achievement of  the  materiel goal  and  assigning offices to  accomplish them.

The ODCSLOG program of  studies makes  analytical  exami› nations  to clarify  problems, provide  assessments,  prepare alterna› tive solutions, develop  conclusions, make  recommendations, and construct methodologies to measure performance in  the  general areas  of installations and  logistics.  In  short, the  program exists  to help  decision makers. First  developed in  the 1970s,  it  consisted of  twenty-two studies in  fiscal  year 1982,  with  thirty-three more planned for  the  following year.

On  1 April  1982 the  Army  redesignated the  Logistics  Studies Steering Group as  the Logistics Studies Steering Committee (LSSC).  Chaired by  the Director for Plans and Operations in ODCSLOG,  the  committee consists  of representatives from  eigh› teen staff agencies and commands. Its primary function is  to provide a  forum at  which the different agencies can  compare what  they  are  doing. They  can  eliminate studies  which  duplicate one  another or,  if the  overlap is less,  redefine or  combine them. The  committee  met  on  26 May  1982 and  reviewed  166 in-process or  planned Army  studies-primarily ODCSLOG,  DARCOM,  and TRADOC  studies-valued at more  than  $44  million.  ODCSLOG published and  distributed the  results  of  the  committee's delibera› tions  in July.

Recent  Army  interest in  reducing the  administrative burdens and streamlining the procedures associated with  property ac› countability dates  from  the  work  of  the  Property Accountability

148

Task  Force  in  1977  and 1978.  During 1982,  General Thompson reemphasized the subject. He  identified the management and accountability of  Army materiel as  a  high-priority issue. The Office of  the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Logistics initiated the Total Army Property Accountability Revitalization Program (TAP ARP)  to  improve this  function within the  Army.  The pro› gram  included the  review  and  revision  by ODCSLOG  of all Army regulations setting forth policy  and procedures to  account for government property. Other portions of  the  program included Proper Count II messages to  inform commanders of  ongoing property accountability initiatives, articles submitted to  various Army  publications, field  visits  by  Department of  the  Army  staff members, and  assessments of  the  status  of  the  property account› ability  program through the  Inspector General Management In› formation System  (IGMIS),  the  Army  Audit  Agency  (AAA),  and Command Logistic  Review  Team  Expanded (CLRTX).  Inherent in  the  revitalization program is the  belief  that  the  current prop› erty  accountability system  tends to  reduce readiness by  forcing the  unit  commander to  focus  time  and  attention on  administra› tion  that  would  be  better devoted to  training.

## Supply and Maintenance

During fiscal  year 1982  the  Total  Army  Equipment Distribu› tion  Program (TAEDP)  received  increased emphasis at all levels. T AEDP  is  a  computer program that uses  all  other automated data processing programs dealing with  major pieces of  Army equipment, that is,  Class VII end items. It is  a  mathematical model  which  encompasses requirements, assets, inputs, equip› ment undergoing repair and rebuilding at  depots, washouts, stocks,  and  the  planned force  and  which  uses  this  information to generate a  master distribution list for Class VII equipment throughout the  entire Army,  active  and  reserve.

The Office of  the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Logistics, the Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Research, Development, and Acquisition, the Depot Systems  Commands, and the U.S. Army Management Systems Support Agency (USAMSSA) worked on  various improvements to  the  program during 1982. The  most  important included strengthening the  analytical capa› bilities  of  TAEDP. These agencies  also  extended the  program to cover  the  five  Program Objective Memorandum (POM) years  as well  as  the current and budget years. During 1982,  TAEDP gained  the  ability  to note  the  substitution of  one  model  of  equip› ment  for  another, for  example,the Ml  main  battle  tank  for  the

M60A3.  In  1982 T AEDP  also received  the  capacity  to produce a number of  on-call reports, that is,  to respond to  special user requirements by reformatting the  data.  Finally,  in  1982 the  Army used  the  troop list  generated by  the  T AEDP  as the  standard by which unit requests for new  equipment were approved or rejected, a  change referred to  as  the  new  requisition validation process.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics  and  the U.S.  Army Materiel, Development, and Readiness Command initiated several  major improvements of  T AEDP  in  1982  which were  not  complete by  the  end  of  the  year.  Depot Systems  Com› mand (DESCOM)  concentrated on  creating a  major item  data base  that  would  consolidate T AEDP's  four  linked  data  bases  into one  on-line transactional data  base  located at  DESCOM.  A sec› ond improvement, displacement distribution planning, would trace  the  cascade  effect  created by the  introduction of  new equip› ment  in  the  Army.  The third major  enhancement begun  in  the fiscal  year  was called  support item  management. Support items are  needed to maintain Class VII  equipment in  the  field,  such  as tool  kits  for  Ml tankers. The  improved program will link  these items  with  the  equipment so  that the  Army  staff  can  determine how  many  pieces  of  major equipment are  actually operable at any  given  time.

The  ability  of  the  U .S. Army,  Europe, to sustain  itself  against a  conventional attack until resupply arrives continued to  be  a major  concern. Because  the  United States  does  not  have  all  the strategic airlift and  sealift  that  it  needs, the  Army  pre-positions supplies in  Europe and other potential theaters of  operations. During 1982 the  Ammunition Office  in the  Office  of the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics  began a  major study  of  the  call  for› ward  and retrograde programs for Europe according to  each type  of  ammunition during the period fiscal  year 1983-1988. This  study  was  associated with  a  more comprehensive one,  Re› source Constrained Procurement Objective for Munitions (RECPOM).  RECPOM  is a computer-assisted simulation  designed to  provide the  most  lethal mix  of  munitions, given  the  various constraints operating on  the  Army.

The  Army  continued to  build up  ammunition stocks  in  Eu› rope  at  a  reasonable rate  during 1982.  The  Ammunition Office still consider it possible  to  reach the  number -of-days  supply  tar› geted  by  the  Department of  Defense by  the  end of  the  funded delivery  period for  fiscal year  1987.  Due  to limited  funding from NA TO,  however,  a serious  storage  problem existed  in  1982. The Army  thought it  was  prudent to  wait  until the  study  on  the  call

forward and  retrograde programs was complete in  order to  de› termine future needs  for  warehouse space  more  accurately be› fore  opening negotiations with  NATO.

Funding levels  for secondary items  financed by  appropria› tions in fiscal year  1982 amounted to $1,099.4  million,  compared with  $856. 5 million  in  fiscal year  1981.  The  increase would  sup› port new  weapons systems fielded under the modernization program. During 1982,  the  Army  lacked  $139.7  million  worth  of initial and replacement parts for aircraft. The Department of the  Army  submitted a  reprogramming request of  $70.4  million to Congress  in order to  remove  the  deficit  at least  partially. Con› gress approved $22.0 million. The Department of the Army planned to  seek  funding for  the  remaining spare parts during fiscal  year 1983.

Because  of unusual delays  in Congress, the  Army  Stock Fund did  not  receive  final  funding of  the  midyear program until  very late,  and  execution fell short  of the  target  by approximately $135 million.  Late  receipt precluded obligation of  the  total  program. In  the  field,  this  situation caused  back  ordering for  parts, kept the  available  supply level  below  the  target figure of  85  percent, and  caused  the  Army  to  lower  its  safety  level  of  spare parts. At no  time,  however, did this  unfortunate situation result in  any unit  being  less than mission  ready. The  Army  Stock  Fund  sales program was virtually on  target at  $5.8  billion.

The  working  capita l of  the  Army  Industrial Fund, acquired initially  through congressional appropriation, is sustained on  an annual  basis by customer reimbursements for  goods  and  services furnished. Activities  financed with  the  fund  are  arsenals,  depots, laborat()ries, missile  facilities,  and port terminals. The  total  cost of  goods  and  services  produced in  fiscal  year 1982 was approxi › mately  $2.8  billion.  The  Army  Industrial Fund  prepared to  im› plement a new capitalization policy  in  1983 that  will allow activi› ties  to  purchase equipment with  Industrial Fund  money  rather than depending on  appropriated funds, which  is  the  current policy.

Depot  maintenance activities  provide for  the  overhaul, repair, conversion, and  renovation of  equipment. Backlog  is defined as that  portion of  the  total  workload which  the  Army  cannot  fund within  available  resources. In  1982 the  Army  took  steps to reduce the hardware backlog to  zero and keep it there. ODCSLOG expected to  receive $1,312 million out of  the $1,355 million needed for  maintenance, overhaul, and  repair during fiscal year 1983.  The addition of  new,  more sophisticated equipment in fiscal year  1984 and  after  will add  to the  total  depot  maintenance

requirement. ODCSLOG  expected  that  the  materiel  maintenance backlog  would  reach $450  million  in  1984.

This  problem not  withstanding, the  materiel  condition of  most Army  systems  and  equipment remained satisfactory  during 1982, although it was  difficult to keep some aging and low-density tactical and engineer equipment in  good repair. (Low  density means  that  there are  only  a  few  pieces  of  equipment within  the worldwide Army  inventory, often only  five  or  less.)  ODCSLOG expected improvement in  the mission-capable rate of  artillery over  the  next  few  years  as a result of  the  deployment of  the  new Ml98  155-mm.  towed  howitzer,  the  upgrading of the  Ml09-series 155-mm. self-propelled howitzer, the MllOA2 self-propelled 8-inch howitzer, and the overhaul of the Ml63Al 20-mm. Vulcan  air  defense gun. A  modernization program in  progress during 1982  for  the  M 113 armored personnel carrier family  of vehicles  will extend benefits beyond the  artillery.

Field  audits  and  inspection reports during the  late  1970s indi› cated a  need for improved maintenance practices. Under the leadership of  Lt.  Gen.  Eivind H. Johansen, the  Deputy Chief  of Staff  for  Logistics  from August 1977  through May  1979,  and  in conjunction with other  staff  agencies  and  major  Army  commands, ODCSLOG  developed the  Maintenance Management Improve› ment  Program (MMIP),  formalized in  Chief of  Staff  Memoran› dum  No.  79-5-4, 5 February 1970,  which  was  still  current in 1982. The  office  designed the  MMIP  to attack  the  root  causes  of maintenance shortfalls identified by various  audit  and  inspection reports. These causes  included lack  of  troop interest and  moti› vation, insufficient involvement by  leaders, lack  of  command attention and emphasis, poorly trained personnel fragmented quality  control, improper use  of  mechanics, and  outdated main› tenance practices.

Problems  that  developed at the  organizational level as a result of  these root causes included the improper use  of  equipment; failure  to detect, identify, report, and  document failures; unnec› essary replacement of  serviceable repair parts; and improper preventive maintenance. Problems at  the support maintenance level included low mechanic use  and  production, improper diag› nosis  of  equipment fault, inadequate unit training programs, and  excessive  evacuation to  higher maintenance levels.

ODCSLOG  developed five primary objectives  for  the  Mainte› nance Management Improvement Program, which General Rogers,  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  from  October 1976  until June 1979,  approved. The  objectives  served  to  provide a  frame› work  for  both  near-term and  sustained improvement action.  The

first  objective  was to  focus  command emphasis  and  attention on the  maintenance area.  Briefings for  general officers  and  various organizations and  activities  began in 1979  and  have  continued ever  since.  ODCSLOG developed a  how-to  maintenance guide for  leaders in  comic  book  style,  DA  PAM  750-1, "Maintenance: Commander's Guide  of  Preventive Maintenance Indicators," 20 August 1979,  which  replaced three publications cast  in  a  more traditional format-DA PAM  750-1,  "Preventive Maintenance: Commander's Guide  of  Preventive Maintenance Indicators," 12 January 1971;  DA  PAM  750-4, "Maintenance of  Supplies and Equipment: Commander's Maintenance Evaluation  Techniques, A Guide  for  Commanders," 19 April  1974; and  DA PAM 750-18, "Commander's Maintenance Guide," 12 March  1973.  The  new pamphlet provided guidance for leaders at  all  levels  on  topics such  as  maintenance management, equipment inspections, re› pair parts, and  motor pool  and maintenance shop  operations. During fiscal  year 1982,  the User Support Policy  Branch in ODCSLOG  revised and expanded DA  PAM  750-1, renamed "Organizational Maintenance Guide  For  Leaders ."  The branch anticipated that  the  Army  would  publish  the  revised  edition  dur› ing  the  first  quarter of  fiscal  year 1983.

The  second  primary objective  in  the  Maintenance Manage› ment  Improvement Program  was upgrading maintenance opera› tions.  The Directorate for  Plans  and  Operations in  ODCSLOG initiated  actions to simplify  procedures and  reduce  administration . The  directorate had  streamlined The  Army  Maintenance Man› agement  System  (TAMMS),  first  developed in the  early  1960s, in TM 38-750,  published in  1978. Other  reforms  included upgrad› ing  serviceability standards, developing standards for  the  trans› fer  of equipment between  units,  and  updating AR 750-1,  "Main› tenance  of Supplies  and  Equipment: Army  Materiel  Maintenance Concepts and Policies,"  which  was  published on  1 April 1978. The  regulation set the  standards for  determining whether a unit is fully mission  capable,  as well as standards for  preventive main› tenance and equipment serviceability. Modified in  both 1979 and 1981,  the  regulation was under review  during 1982  by  the Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics  in  preparation for  a  major  revision.

A  third objective was  to  strengthen maintenance training. The  U.S.  Army  Training and  Doctrine Command (TRADOC), beginning in  1979, reviewed  the  entire  spectrum of maintenance training, including course curriculum baselines for individual training (that  is,  the  core  curriculum common  to  the  supervisor and  leader training of  all  the  branch schools),  training devices,

and  materials. TRADOC initiated corrective actions  to  improve conditions at  the  service  schools  and  at  the  unit level.  The com› mand  has  had  supervisory leader and  precommand courses un› der development since 1979,  although during fiscal  year 1982 precommand courses received the  most  attention.

The fourth objective was  to  improve the management of people. The U.S.  Army Materiel, Development, and Readiness Command (DARCOM) expressed concern over the lack  of  a well-thought-out maintenance career. Under prompting from the  Office of  Deputy Chief of  Staff for  Logistics, the  Office of the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Personnel reviewed  personnel poli› cies  in the maintenance career fields and analyzed proposals intended to  improve conditions. Operating under the supervi› sion  of  ODCSPER and  ODCSLOG, TRADOC developed a  sys› tems  mechanic (master mechanic) career management field  and studied the  consolidation of  maintenance officer  specialties.  Pres› sure from the General Accounting Office of  the Army  Audit Agency  caused FORSCOM to  develop, on  a  test  basis,  a  main› tenance manpower utilization system, which FORSCOM and TRADOC  subsequently adopted for  all their direct support and general support units. ODCSPER, at the instigation of ODCSLOG,  also adopted several  reforms to improve the  acquisi› tion  and retention of  maintenance personnel, including the  es› tablishment of a minimum score  on  the  enlistment test  to get  into maintenance career fields  and  a  reenlistment bonus  for  mainte› nance  specialists.

The  final  objective  called  for  an  improvement in  publications, tools,  and  repair parts support. Beginning in  1979,  ODCSLOG, TRADOC,  and  DARCOM  updated maintenance publications to improve operations and  reduce tasks.  The U.S.  Army  Logistics Evaluation Agency  initiated Armywide implementation of  skill performance aids  which  combined technical documentation and associated  training materials  in one  complete package.  ODCSLOG expected these  aids  to  reach the  troops during the  first  quarter of  fiscal  year 1983.  Steps  to  improve authorized lists  of  combat stock, procedures for  returning repairable equipment, and  means for  the  direct exchange of  repair parts  between units,  sponsored by  ODCSLOG and  implemented by  DARCOM, began in 1979 and  have  continued to  the present.

The Maintenance Management Improvement Program in› cluded procedures for  getting information to  the  field  immedi› ately. Since 1979, numbered "Maintenance Improvement Flashers" have announced policy and procedure updates and changes to  the field, and "Maintenance Improvement Grams"

have  provided general information and  coordination. The Of› fice of the  Deputy Chief  of Staff  for  Logistics  has  held  in-process reviews  periodically since 1979  to  ensure that the program re› mains  viable.  The  most  recent in-process review  occurred in  Feb› ruary 1982.

The Standard Army Maintenance System  is  an  automated logistics  management system,  twelve  years  in  development, that will provide maintenance management from  the  direct support and  general support units  at retail  level  up  through DARCOM at the  Army  wholesale level.  When extended to  battalion and  divi› sion  maintenance companies, sometime during 1986,  the  system will improve the  use  of  resources in  the  Army  and  provide auto› mated maintenance support to combat service support units. The  Assistant Secretary of  the  Army  for  Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management had approved the combat service support modules for  automation on  the  division-level data  entry device, a  military minicomputer system designed for logistics applications. In  fiscal  year 1982  this  minicomputer program was terminated. Consequently, the  Army  started a replacement pro› gram  entitled The  Tactical  Army  Combat  Service  Support Com› puter System. During the fiscal  year, the Logistics Center and the  Computer Systems  Command worked toward adapting the combat  service  support applications of the  Standard Army  Main› tenance System  to  this  replacement computer.

Maintenance support activities include maintenance engi› neering, technical  assistance,  publication updates, and  new  equip› ment  training for  the  whole  Army. During 1982,  the  growth of requirements for  these  activities  outstripped available  resources. Fiscal  year 1983  promises no  relief  because the  increased fund› ing  for  maintenance support will  go  primarily for  new  systems scheduled for fielding. Funding of  maintenance support for equipment not being modernized will  actually decline because the  Army  has  decided to  provide full  funding for  maintenance support activities  for  the  new  equipment. Funding for 1983  will furnish only  $530  million  of  the  $734  million  needed for  mainte› nance  support.

The  Army  did  not  experience any  major  shortfalls in the  base operations line  of  the 1982  budget. Congressional support for the  fiscal  year 1982  budget amendment resulted in  the  creation of additional civilian  personnel spaces  to replace military  person› nel  who  had  been  temporarily borrowed from  units  to  perform critical base  operations missions .  During 1982  the  major com› mands  were  able  to  apply  funds to  existing shortfalls and  back› logs in bachelor housing furnishing, support for  morale, welfare

and  recreation activities,  maintenance work,  and  replenishment of  operating supply stocks.  The Army  applied the  funds made available  in  1982-due to  congressional action on  the  pay  and program supplementals-toward the  purchase of  furniture for bachelor housing in  Europe and  FORSCOM.

## Transportation

There were no  major new  initiatives in  the transportation area  in fiscal year  1982. Rather  the  Army  concentrated on  follow› ing  up  programs begun  in previous years.  Six programs received major  emphasis: the  "CONUS Mobility  Analysis,"  logistics  over the  shore, containerized shipping, the  nontactical vehicle  fleet, the  Department of  the  Army Movements Management System, and the Department of the Army Standard Port System› Enhanced.

Until  fiscal  year 1981,  deployment planning had  focused  on reinforcing theaters of  operation by aircraft until  the  first  ships started to arrive.  Because  of the  inadequate number of Air  Force C-5As  compared with  the  Army's  strategic airlift requirements, some  units  that  did  not  have  the  highest priority on  the  staging list would  arrive  more  quickly  in the  theater of operations if they deployed  by ship  rather than  by air.  Therefore, the  Office  of the Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics  planned to  integrate air  and sea  movements so  that seaborne units would  arrive at  the  time and  in  the  order desired by  the  theater commander. This  shift followed  a study  of  reinforcement rates  called  the  "CON US Mo› bility  Analysis."

During 1982, ODCSLOG and other concerned agencies worked  on  actions  designed to  correct deficiencies noted in  the study.  The Navy  purchased several  commerically built  sea-land container ships, designated as  SL-7s, which  were  converted to carry  roll-on,  roll-off  equipment such  as tanks,  armored person› nel  carriers, and  self-propelled artillery; the  ships  can  travel  at thirty-five knots  or  more.  They  provide a more  efficient method of  moving an  armored division overseas than the  C-5As. Pre› positioning of  unit  basic  load  permits, discussed at  length in  the fiscal year  1981 Historical Summary, continued during 1982. Dur› ing 1982,  work  was  completed on  the  port for  the U.S.  Army Military Traffic  Management Command  (MTMC)  at Sunny  Point, North  Carolina. Work  continued on  the  Navy's  port  at Earl,  New Jersey.

In 1980  ODCSLOG proposed and MTMC  sponsored the contingency response program. It  involved  preparing and  main-

taining an  inventory of  private trucking firms within specified geographic areas  which  would  be  able  to  move  Army  equipment in an  emergency. The  installation transportation capability  survey, begun  by ODCSLOG  and  run  by the  MTMC-specifically by its Transportation Engineering Agency-is an  ongoing program to assess receiving and  shipping capabilities at  military  installations. During 1982  the  survey  concentrated on  depots.

The "CONUS Mobility Analysis" and the actions resulting from it  affect planning for operations in  all  potential foreign theaters. The logistics  over the  shore (LOTS)  program focuses primarily on  operations by  the  Rapid Deployment Force  in  re› gions  of  the  world  without extensive port facilities.  During 1982 the  DCSLOG  led  the  move  to  have  over  one  billion  dollars in› cluded in  the Program Objective Memorandum for LOTS  for fiscal  years 1984-1988. The LOTS  program procures commer› cially available  landing craft, utility  (LCU),  and  logistics  support vessels (LSV)  as  well  as  other essential supporting craft and lighterage. In addition to the POM  initiative, funding of the second  company of  lighter air  cushion vehicles  (LACV)-30 was realized in  the  fiscal  year 1982  and 1983  budgets. LACV-30 is a medium amphibian, air  cushion vehicle  that  can  be  used on  70 percent of  the  world's beaches, compared with  only 17 percent now acceptable to conventional lighterage. The  LACV-30, which can  transport twenty-five to  thirty short tons  of  containerized or break-bulk cargo  at  a cruising speed  of  forty-six miles  per  hour, operates independently of  tides, reefs, mudflats, water depths, underwater obstacles, or  bottom gradients. DARCOM  signed  a contract for  construction of  the  twelve  craft  needed to  equip the new  company. Also  during 1982  the Army accepted the first production model  LACV-30 at  Fort  Story,  Virginia. At  the  end of  September 1982,  ODCSLOG expected the  last  of  the  twenty› four craft required for the two  companies to  be  delivered by fiscal  year 1985.

Containerized shipping is one  of  the  most  important innova› tions for  moving  supplies  and  equipment in the  last three  decades. In  1982  the  Army's  containerization program was dominated by actions  stemming from  the  general officer review  of June 1981. Following an  analysis of  the review's conclusions by  the Army staff  and  the  major  commands, the  Transportation Management Division  in  ODCSLOG consolidated all  the  material into  a  com› prehensive overview  of  the  Army's  efforts to  develop, field,  and sustain a  wartime container capacity. This overview was  pre› sented to  the  Army Staff  Council at  an  information briefing in July 1982.  The  office  spent the  rest  of  the  year  trying to  resolve

areas of  concern. General Thompson requested that the  J-4 (Logistics)  on  the  Joint Staff  study  long-range shipping capabili› ties to correct what  he  perceived to be  a deficiency in  long-range containerization planning. He  hoped that the  Joint Staff  study would  give the  services  a benchmark by which  to measure future development of  the program. TRADOC began reviewing the requirement for  a  unit storage and  deployment locker, an  item of  unit equipment, as  a  replacement for  the  CONEX, the  stan› dard container used for transporting unit equipment and for storage. A  test  of  containers conducted jointly by  the Military Airlift Command and the U.S.  Army Materiel, Development, and  Readiness Command in  early  April 1982  provided the  basis for  developing a  prototype container for  air  delivery. III Corps conducted a test  at  Fort Hood,  Texas,  also  in  April 1982,  of  the equipment and  doctrine for  a general support ammunition com› pany  to  receive,  store,  and  issue  containerized ammunition. The eight-by-six-foot containers proved satisfactory in  rough terrain under combat  conditions.

While  developments in  containerized shipping, logistics  over the  shore, and  the  "CONUS Mobility  Analysis"  were  promising, the  condition of  the Army's nontactical vehicle fleet remained bleak.  During fiscal  year 1982  the  fleet  continued to  deteriorate as  Congress adhered to  the policy  begun in 1977  of  not  ade› quately funding replacements. During the  year  the  number of vehicles  declined from approximately 70,000 to  about 68,000. As  of  30  September 1982,  38  percent of  all  vehicles required replacement, the  same  level  as  during fiscal  year 1981.  To  par› tially  offset its  deficiencies, the  Army  leased  over  2,000  vehicles during 1982.

The  Army  had  two  major  computer software systems  under development in the  transportation area  in  1982:  the  Department of  the Army  Movements Management System  (DAMMS)  and the  Department of  the  Army Standard Port System-Enhanced (DASPS-E).

DAMMS  consists  of  three major modules, the  cargo move› ments  module  (CMM), the  movements  planning  module  (MPM)› both  discussed in  some  detail in  the 1981 Historical Summary› and  the  MODE  management module (MMM).  The  MMM  pro› vides  information about  transportation assets  within  a theater as well as driver  availability  and  scheduled maintenance. In  Septem› ber 1982  the  Strategic Mobility  Division,  ODCSLOG, prepared and  submitted an  update of  the  DAMMS  functional description and  economic  analysis  to the  Assistant  Secretary of the  Army  for Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management for review.

In  the  same  month the  Logistics  Center distributed to  users  for their review  a  major systems  change package (SCP-05 - 08)  for DAMMS,  which  will  furnish a  data base  on  break-bulk cargo. Another systems  change package (SCP-04), sent  to  units  in  the field  in  May,  provides an  interface between the  Standard Army Intermediate Level  Supply System  (SAILS)  and DAMMS  that records and  controls requisitions in  transit. The  Strategic Mobil› ity Division expected  the  SAILS  portion  of the  interface  to become operational in  April 1983.  The Command, Control, Communi› cations,  and  Computer Division of the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief of  Staff  for  Operations and  Plans  completed the  replacement of the DAMMS  computers (IBM  4331s) with modern hardware (IBM  36B-40s) in  October 1981.  The new  equipment made  it possible to  redesign the movements management system  and replace  batch  processing with  interactive processing-that is, sub› stitute on-line processing, in  which  each  unit of  information is processed immediately at  the  time  of  presentation, for  a sequen› tial  procedure that  uses  an  accumulation of  information divided into  groups or  batches before processing.

The  development of  the  Department of  the  Army  Standard Port  System-Enhanced progressed satisfactorily  during 1982 and remained on  schedule for  initial  fielding in the  second  quarter of fiscal  year 1984.  A  system acceptance test (SAT)  training in› process review (IPR) at Fort Lee, Virginia, was  held in  June 1982.  In May  1982  the Assistant Secretary of  the Army  for Installations, Logistics,  and  Financial  Management approved the hardware (DAS3,  Model  B)  for  the  DASPS-E software accep› tance  tests,  and  subsequently approved the  remaining DASPS-E hardware needed to  implement the  full  fielding plan  in  the  re› quired operational capability (ROC)  paper of  September 1982. At the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  the  Logistics  Center and  Computer Systems  Command planned to  hold  the  software acceptance re› view for  DASPS-E in  March  and  April 1983.

## Security Assistance

The  security  assistance  program supports U.S.  foreign policy by helping friendly and  allied  governments to achieve  and  main› tain  the ability  to  defend themselves. Army  security assistance programs for  fiscal  year 1982 consisted  of seven  different types: Military  Assistance  Programs (MAPs);  International Military  Ed› ucation  and  Training (IMET)  programs; Foreign Military  Sales (FMS)  programs; Foreign Military Construction Sales  (FMCS) programs; Foreign  Military  Sales financing programs; coproduc› tion  programs; and  commercial sales  programs.

During 1982,  security assistance received more  high-level at› tention than in  previous years. Two  factors contributed to  this situation. First,  senior  officials  and  officers in  the  Department of Defense  recognized the  need  to become  more  involved  in revital› izing and  improving the  program. In  this  regard, the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  decided to  play  a  more prominent role  in justifying the program before Congress and the public. Second, the depart› ment  needed to  obtain revised legislation as a statutory basis  for the  new  conventional arms transfer policy  promulgated by  the Reagan administration in  July 1981, discussed in  that year's Historical  Summary.

Fiscal  year 1982  saw  an  extraordinary amount of  activity  in security  assistance legislation. At  the  beginning of  the  year,  Con› gress was  still  debating the authorization of  the International Security  and  Development Cooperation Act  of  1981  for  the  fis› cal  year.  Congress finally  passed compromise authorization and appropriations bills  in mid-December, and President Reagan signed  them  into  law on  29 December 1981.  The  legislation dou› bled  the  dollar ceilings  of  FMS sales  to $50  million  and  increased the  ceiling  to  $200  million for FMCS  sales  to  foreign countries that  require review  by  Congress; it  also  removed the  dollar ceil› ing on  commercial sales of arms  and  services  to foreign countries and  authorized the  Department of Defense  to lease arms  to them. The  act  expanded the  duties of  the  overseas security organiza› tions  (SAOs),  which  are  the  groups charged with  administering the  security assistance program in  country. The  old  law  limited the  SAOs  to  essentially administrative functions: logistical sup› port  management, transportation, fiscal  management, and  con› tract administration. The new  law  allowed officers in  SAOs  to help  host  governments evaluate their military  requirements and plan the military force needed to  meet them. The legislation authorized assistance  to Nicaragua, Argentina, Chile,  El Salvador, and  Pakistan under specific  conditions and  removed restrictions on  assistance to  Jordan and Panama. Finally, it  established the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF)  to  acquire defense articles in  anticipation of  their transfer to  other countries.

The  establishment of  the Special  Defense Acquisition Fund was especially gratifying to  the  Army. Since  1976,  both the  Of› fice of  the  Secretary of  Defense  and  the  Department of  the  Army had  tried  to obtain funds from  Congress for  defense articles  and services to  meet urgent requests from friendly governments. Money  for  the  Special Defense Acquisition Fund would come from  three sources: (1) receipts from  the  sale  of  defense articles which  the  services did not intend to  replace; (2)  receipts from

charges  and  recoupments from  nonrecurring research, develop› ment,  and  production costs;  and  (3) other funds  appropriated by Congress  for  this  account. The  International Security  and  Devel› opment Act  authorized $300  million  for  the  fund in  fiscal  year 1982  and $300 million for the following fiscal years, with a cumulative ceiling  of  $600  million. Congress appropriated $125 million  for the fund in  the fiscal  year 1982  supplement to  the Department of  Defense budget. The Director of  the Defense Security  Assistance  Agency  provides  day-to-day  management and operation of  the  fund.

In conjunction with  all  the  legislative activity in the  security assistance  area,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Opera› tions  and  Plans  conducted a review  of  all international programs; it  then proposed legislative and Department of  Defense policy changes. Maj.  Gen.  J.  W.  Seigel, the Director of  the Strategy, Plans,  and Policy  Directorate in  ODCSOPS, proposed standard pricing for  all  Foreign Military  Sales  training and  a comprehen› sive  exchange program, as  well  as  continued emphasis on  the "total  package approach" in  the  Foreign Military  Sales  process  as the  sales  program expanded with  new  and more sophisticated weapons  and  systems.  Under this  policy,  the  U.S.  Army  Materiel Development and  Readiness Command makes  customers aware of  support items  and services needed to  maintain and  operate the  equipment. In  the  area of  policy  development, the  Security Assistance  Division  in  ODCSOPS published revised  guidance on providing Army  tanks  for  security  assistance  and  on  transferring and  supporting Nike  Hercules air  defense systems.

New  orders in  the  Department of  Defense for  security assis› tance  for  fiscal year  1982  totaled $21.5  billion,  of which  the  share managed by  the Army  amounted to  $4.2  billion. New  security assistance  business  is generated from  amendments and  modifica› tions  to  prior-year cases  and  from  new  orders implemented dur› ing  the year. At  the end of  the fiscal  year, the Army  security assistance open  cases  amounted to  $42.4  billion. (Table 9)

The general upward trend in  equipment diversions contin› ued  during fiscal  year 1982.  President Reagan approved diver› sions  to support allies  and  friendly nations faced  with  ongoing or imminent threats and to  fulfill certain foreign policy  commit› ments. The principal recipients included El  Salvador, Pakistan, the  Sudan, and  Somalia. The  diversions involved 126  tanks, 32 helicopters, 75  howitzers, 623  machine guns, 15,602  rifles,  492 radios, and  4,517  TOW  missiles.  In  addition the  Army  diverted 198,559 rounds of  large-caliber ammunition during the fiscal year'. a 7  4 percent increase over  the  114,146  rounds diverted the prev10us  year.

aMost of the  $18.0  billion managed by the  Corps  of  Engineers is for  its substantial  construction program  in Saudi Arabi a.

Current high-demand items  are  pieces  of  Army  equipment and  munitions used  by  the  active  Army  and  by  foreign armies. The  list  below  contains the  most  important items  in  fiscal  year  1982.

| Current High-Demand Items                  | Current High-Demand Items      |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Armored personnel carrier (APC), Ml 13Al/2 | TOW, launcher                  |
| Howitzer, self-propelled, Ml 10A2, 8-inch  | TOW, missile                   |
| Howitzer, self-propelled, Ml09Al/2         | Improved (I) Hawk, missile     |
| Howitzer, towed, Ml 98, 155-mm.            | Improved (I) Hawk, battery set |
| Recovery veh icle, M88Al                   | Chaparral missle               |
| Tank, M60 series                           | Chaparral launcher             |
|                                            | Stinger weapons system         |

The  lead-time of  Foreign Military  Sales  for  most  of  these  items exceeded two  years. They were prime candidates for Special Defense  Acquisition  Fund  purchases in order to allay the  compe› tition  between the  U.S.  Army  and  foreign buyers and  to  mini› mize  the  need  for  future diversions from  Army  units.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers provided various  degrees of engineering and  construction man› agement support to  nine foreign governments-Saudi Arabia, Israel,  Jordan, Oman, Egypt, Nigeria, Sudan, Honduras, and the  Federal Republic  of  Germany-under the  Foreign Military Construction Sales program, formerly a part  of the  Foreign Mili› tary  Sales  program. The Corps  also  continued to  provide sup› port to the Saudi Arabian Army Ordnance Corps Program (SOCP).

Coproduction enables  a foreign  government, commercial  firm, or  international organization to  acquire the  technical know-how to  assemble  or  manufacture an  Army  weapons  system  in whole or  in  part. The  Army  initiated its  first coproduction program

with  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  in  1960 for  the Hawk  missile  system.  Since  then the  Army  has  partici› pated  in programs with  thirteen foreign  countries and  NATO.  A memorandum of  understanding requires the  foreign producers to purchase American components. The  total  dollar  value  for  all coproduction projects through fiscal  year 1982 was $6.3  billion, with  $2.4  billion  in  value  returned to  the  United States.

Concern  that  international coproduction was adversely  affect› ing  the  Army's  mobilization and  production base  led  DARCOM to develop  a method of evaluating  the  impact  of individual  copro› duction projects on  the production base. At  the same time Congress, concerned about the lay-off of skilled workers at defense-oriented manufacturing plants, passed legislation that prevented foreign governments from receiving technical data and  assistance from  government-owned and  -operated defense plants manufacturing large-caliber cannon. These issues,  cou› pled  with  foreign government requirements for  offsets-that is, the  U.S.  government or  a U.S. company would  have  to purchase products of  the coproducing country-affected several copro› duction projects  in  1982.  ODCSLOG expected these  constraints would  continue.

The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of  1981 authorized the  President to  furnish grant  aid  to  any friendly country or  international organization when  he  believes that the assistance will  strengthen the security of  the United States. President Reagan used this  provision to  send aid  to  El Salvador.  Other aid  fell  under the  International Military  Educa› tion  and  Training Program, which  provided instruction to  mili› tary and.  related civilian personnel of  friendly countries on  a grant basis.  The Army  conducted the training in  the United States, on  overseas U.S.  military facilities, or through mobile teams  in  the  foreign countries. Barbados, Honduras, Portugal, Spain,  Thailand, and  Tunisia received training aids  and  devices under the  IMET. During fiscal  year 1982,  the  IMET program consisted of  $19.1 million  for  seventy-one countries. The total ongoing undelivered grant aid  program for  all  years  included twenty-five participating countries  and  was valued  at $221 million.

A total  of 8,599  foreign students received  military  training in the  continental United  States  under U.S. Army  sponsorship dur› ing  fiscal year  1982-2 ,316 under the  IMET  program and  6,283 under the  Foreign Military  Sales program. Training funded un› der the former exceeded $4.5 million; under the latter, $34 million.  Participating countries financed the  International Fel› lows Program (IFP)  at  the  U.S.  Army  War  College  through FMS

or  IMET. During the 1982-1983 academic year,  Japan, Korea, Malaysia,  Pakistan, Sri  Lanka, France, West  Germany, China, Kuwait,  Spain,  Somalia,  Tunisia, Turkey, the  United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Canada participated. Eight of  these countries were  in  the  program for  the  first  time .

The Personnel Exchange Program (PEP)  expanded during fiscal year  1982 from  94  positions  with  sixteen  countries partici› pating to 102  positions with  nineteen countries. Expansion in› cluded  agreements with  Ecuador, Paraguay, and  Jordan and  an increase of positions with the United Kingdom, Venezuela, Australia, Canada , and  New  Zealand.  Exchanges  with  Australia, Canada, New  Zealand, and the  United Kingdom still  made up the bulk of the program in 1982-77 of the 102  approved positions. General Meyer,  Army  Chief  of  Staff,  decided to  shift the  priority of  effort toward expanding the  program with  non› English-speaking armies  in  1980.  In  line  with  this  policy,  at  the end of  the fiscal  year he  was  considering expanding PEP  to include  the  armies  of  Egypt,  Spain,  Paraguay, Greece,  Portugal, and  Turkey.

In  September 1982,  the Washington  Post broke  a  story  about Capt.  Jesse  A.  Garcia,  U.S.  Army,  serving with  the  Guatamalan Army  under PEP.  Some  congressmen confused PEP with  a mili› tary  adviser  program. Congressional prohibitions concerning re› ciprocal  arrangements for  formal training combined  with  a mis› understanding over  the  intent of  the  program and  its legal  basis threatened to  hamp er  PEP  greatly  in  the  future.

In  1982,  110 countries and  international organizations partici› pated  in  Army  security  assistance  programs. The  programs var› ied  greatly  in  size and  technical  sophistication. The  largest  Army country program, Saudi  Arabia, amounted to  over  $22  billion . Other  large  programs included  Israel,  $3 billion;  Egypt,  $2 billion; Jordan, $1  billion; Kor ea,  $1  billion; and West  Germany, $1 billion.  These six country programs made  up  over  75 percent of the  Army's  open  case  value.

NATO's  interest  in security  assistance  remained high  in fiscal year  1982  as  the  member armies  continued their efforts to  im› prove combat effectiveness significantl y  by  modernizing the armament. The  continuing expansion and  modernization of So› viet for ces provided ample  impetus  for  NATO  efforts.  Th e most notable  event  of the  year  was the  entry  of  Spain  into  the  alliance on 5 June 1982.  The United States  and  Spain  also  concluded a base rights  treaty  on  2 July 1982 after  approximately one  year  of negotiation.

Eight  countries in  the  Middle East  qualified for  either For› eign  Military  Sales credits, IMET,  or  economic  support funds  in 1982. Egypt  and  Israel  were  the  largest  FMS credit  clients,  while Egypt  and  Jordan were  the  largest IMET  recipients.

During  the  year  the  existing  security  assistance  programs for Saudi  Arabia  continued to expand. Ongoing programs included the mechanization of two  Army brigades, the Saudi Arabian National  Guard (SANG)  Modernization Program, and  the  Saudi Naval  Expansion Program. Work  also  continued on  the  Saudi Arabian National Guard Medical  Program. Toward the  end  of fiscal  year 1981,  the United States  and Saudi  Arabia signed a memorandum of  understanding covering the entire medical project.  The  Army  Medical  Department (AMEDD) put  together a  team of  officers to  develop a  comprehensive plan covering Saudi  Arabian National Guard health. The  plan  addressed six basic  areas: preventive medicine and public health, hospitals, clinics,  field  medical service,  the  office  of  the  director of  health services,  and support systems.  The section  on  support systems included medical logistics, patient administration, information systems,  communication, and training. After the plan  was  re› viewed by the  relevant  agencies  on  the  Army  staff,  the  DCSLOG, as the  focal  point  on  all security  assistance  matters for  the  Army, approved and  forwarded it to  the  director of  the  Defense  Secu› rity  Assistance  Agency  in  October 1982.

The Camp  David  Accords of 1979  committed the United States to replacing two  air bases, at Etam  and Etzion, which Israel  would  have  to  abandon when  it withdrew from  the  Sinai. The  new  bases  at  Ramon and  Ovda  were  completed this  year. Each  consists  of  two  10,000-foot runways, a  taxiway  of  similar length which  can  be  used as  a  runway in  an  emergency, har › dened  underground hangers, and  the  ancillary  facilities  needed to  operate military  air  bases.

Israel  continued to  maintain a  generally recognized margin of  military superiority over  any  possible  combination of  oppo› nents  in  the  region. During fiscal  year 1982,  the  United States used  Foreign Military  Sales financing to address Israel's  priority needs  for  air  defense, armored and tracked vehicles,  artillery, missiles,  and  ammunition. In  response to requests from  the  gov› ernment of  Lebanon, the  Army expedited delivery of  various communications items,  tactical  vehicles,  recoiless  rifles,  and  ma› chine  guns.

The  total  Foreign Military  Sales program for  Egypt,  through fiscal year  1983,  has  a planned value  of  $3.95  billion.  The  Army portion  is $2.3 billion. The  most significant  items were 439 M60A3

•

tanks, 220  of  which  were  purchased in 1982; 1,214  Mll3 ar› mored  personnel carriers; and  twelve  !Hawk  batteries. Techni› cal  Assistance Field  Teams (TAFTs) sent to  Egypt included a team  on  logistics  management, the armor project manager, a team  from  the  U.S.  Armor School,  and  CH-47 helicopter and !Hawk teams. The Corps of  Engineers assisted the U.S.  and Egyptian  Air  Forces  in  designing facilities  at  An  Shas  Air  Force Base  to  support F-16 fighter aircraft. A  total  of  221  Egyptian officers  received training under the  International Military  Edu› cation and Training program. In addition there were  twenty› eight  Defense Production Assistance  projects during 1982.  The objective  of  these  programs was to strengthen the  capabilities of the  Egyptian defense industry as well as the  Egyptian economy.

The U.S.  government continued to  emphasize the impor› tance  of  U.S.-Pakistani relations. The  two governments targeted security  assistance to  remedy deficiencies in  Pakistani defenses and  obsolescent equipment. Pakistan  was mainly  concerned with the  early  delivery  of F-16  aircraft. The  U.S. Army  also addressed armor, air  defense, and  other combat  capabilities. Pakistan  pur› chased  field  artillery, armored vehicles,  helicopter missiles,  and ammunition valued  at  $394.2 million.

Relations  with  India  remained cool because  of improving rela› tions  with  Pakistan. The BMY  Division  of  Harsco Corporation conducted the one major Foreign Military Sales  arrangement with India, an in-country test of the M 109A2  self-propelled 155-mm.  howitzer, which  American Army  officers attended as observers.

In  1982 the  Army  conducted Defense  Requirement Surveys, the  first  step  in  initiating or  expanding security assistance  rela› tionships, in  Liberia and  Botswana. Thirty states  in  sub-Sahara Africa qualified for either Foreign Military Sales (FMS)  or economic  support funds.  Sudan  and  Kenya  were  the  largest  FMS clients  as well as  the  largest IMET  recipients. There was also an increase  in  the  number of  mobile  training teams  (MTTs)  south of the Sahara. Most  of  the training teams were equipment› oriented. However, some  conducted nation-building projects.

The  guaranteed credit  program under Foreign  Military  Sales increased from $126.4 million in  fiscal  year 1981  to  approxi› mately  $24 7  .6  million in  fiscal  year 1982  for  fourteen African countries excluding Egypt.  Djibouti  and  Senegal  became  eligible for  FMS credits  in  1982.  Somalia,  in conflict  with  Ethiopia along their  border, received  expedited delivery  of vehicles, ammunition, small  arms,  and  antitank systems  in July 1982.  Tunisia and  the United  States  formally  agreed that  the  Army  would  provide  Tu-

nisia  with  !Chaparral and  M60A3  tanks  and  spare parts as  well as the  training required to operate and  repair them.  Morocco,  in conflict  with  the  Polisario, received expedited assistance to  train and  equip an  infantry brigade. Survey teams visited Botswana and  Liberia to  help in  future security assistance programs, and Congress lifted the Brooke Amendment restrictions for Zaire, which  permitted further extensions of  military assistance even though  the  government of President Mobutu  Sese Seko had  fallen behind on  its  payments for  equipment previously received.

The  security assistance programs for  the  Pacific  region dur› ing  fiscal  year 1982  continued to  be  affected by  several events: the instability in Southeast Asia  caused by  the occupation of Kampuchea by  the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam coupled with Thailand's tacit  allowance of  anti-Vietnamese elements operat› ing  inside Thailand; internal problems in  the Philippines; and the  potential for  conflict on  the  Korean peninsula. During fiscal year  1982,  follow-up U.S.  support continued for  defense equip› ment previously furnished to  Taiwan. Major Army end items delivered during fiscal  year 1982  included self-propelled 155mm.  howitzers, .SO-caliber  machine guns, and !Hawk missiles. Under the  fiscal  year 1982  Taiwan Foreign Military  Sales  train› ing program, seventy-five Taiwanese-forty-two officers and thirty-three enlisted men-received U.S. Army courses of instruction.

In  South Korea,  extensive coproduction and  coassembly pro› grams  continued to  operate effectively.  They  included small  arms munitions, Ml6  rifles,  Vulcan air  defense guns,  helicopters, and tank  munitions. During 1982,  the  Army  added ammunition val› ued  at  approximately $130  million  to  U.S.  war  reserve stocks  in Korea, which  are  designated for use  by  the  Republic of  Korea (ROK)  ground forces in  the  event of  war.  The U.S.  Army  pro› vided  instruction to  160  ROK  personnel in  various professional development and  technical  training courses  during the  fiscal year.

Japan continued to purchase military equipment, services, and  training of a defensive nature from  the  United States  during fiscal year 1982. Japan also  kept  up  its vigorous licensed produc› tion  program. This  program enhanced Japan's defense posture, expanded its  defense production industrial base, increased its capacity  for  wartime sustainability, and  promoted the  interoper› ability  of  Japanese and U.S.  forces. Coproduction agreements with  the  United States involved building systems  to  produce 8inch  howitzers and  Nike  and  !Hawk  missiles . Discussions  contin› ued for coproduction of additional systems including TOW, Copperhead, Stinger, Patriot, and  the  AH-lS helicopter. During

the  year,  25 Japanese Ground Self-Defense  Force  troops  received professional or  technical training in the  United States,  and 1,643 officers and  enlisted men  participated in  !Hawk and Nike  an› nual  service  practice at  Fort Bliss,  Texas.

The  threat of  incursions by the  Socialist  Republic  of Vietnam along  the  Thai-Kampuchea border continued to  stimulate Thai concerns and requests for security assistance. Air  defense and additional armor remained high  on  Thailand's priority list.  The Director J-4 (Logistics) on the Joint  Staff,  Lt. Gen. 0. E. DeHaven, began  bilateral logistics  planning with  the  Thai Supreme Com› mand  in  order to  provide Thailand with  the  expertise needed for  long-range planning.

Twenty  countries in  the  Western Hemisphere received secu› rity  assistance from the United States  during fiscal  year 1982. Security  assistance  in  FMS  guaranteed credit and  Military  Assis› tance Program (MAP)  grants increased from $56.3 million in fiscal  year 1981  to  approximately $151.9 million in  fiscal  year 1982.  The number of  countries in  the  region that  were  author› ized  MAP or  FMS credit  programs grew  from  seven  in fiscal year 1981  to  nineteen in fiscal year 1982, including Costa Rica, Colombia, Panama, and nine island nations of the eastern Caribbean. The  high  points  of the  security  assistance  program in 1982 came  when  President Reagan  used  Section  506, "Emergency Drawdown  Authority," of  the  Foreign Assistance  Act  to  provide El Salvador  with  $55  million,  and  Congress passed  Supplemental Fiscal  Year 1982,  Military Assistance Program, authorizations for  Honduras ($10 million)  and  Costa  Rica ($2 million).  TRADOC trained  a Salvadorian light  infantry battalion  at Fort  Bragg,  North Carolina, and an  officer candidate battalion at Fort Benning, Georgia. Honduras received a  total of  $30  million in  security assistance. The Department of  Defense directed the Corps of Engineers to  manage the design and construction of  two  air› fields  in  Honduras which  will be  able  to  support F-15 aircraft. The  Mobile  District  of  the  Corps  South  Atlantic  Division  started design  work  for  upgrading the  airfields, with  construction sched› uled  to start  on  one  site during fiscal year  1982. Central America received  the  bulk  of military  assistance  in the  area,  but  Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Paraguay participated in  substantial pro› grams. Colombia received howitzers, helicopters, and antitank missiles.  Ecuador became the first Foreign Military Sales  cus› tomer  to obtain  the  Ml98 155-mm.  towed  howitzer . Brazil  imple› mented Foreign Military Sales  cash  cases  for  ammunition, and Paraguay purchased UH-lB helicopters.

Military-to-military relations with  Latin  America suffered as a  result of  U.S.  support for  Great Britain during the  Falkland

Islands  war  between Argentina and  the  United Kingdom. As a result of  this  crisis,  western solidarity against insurgencies and subversion supported by  the  Soviet  Union and  Cuba  weakened considerably and thus dampened the effects of U.S.  security assistance  efforts in  the  region.

The  Security  Assistance  Affiliated Program consists  of  train› ing  U.S. Army  officers  in security  assistance  and  related policies. Lt. Gen.  W.R.  Richardson, the  Deputy  Chief  of Staff  for  Opera› tions  and  Plans,  directed the  Security  Assistance  Division  to  un› dertake a comprehensive study  of the  foreign officer  specialty  in July 1982 in order to  identify the  Army's  requirements for  offi› cers  in  the  Foreign  Area  Officer  Specialty  through the  year  2000, to  examine different options in  training foreign area officers and recommend the best  training strategy, and to  design the most  efficient management structure for  career progression in the  specialty.  General  Richardson forwarded the  comp leted  study to  Lt. Gen. M.  R.  Thurman, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, on  8  September 1982  for  approval and implemen› tation.  The  study  projected an  increase in the  number of foreign area  officers  from  the  current level of  1,138 positions  to  1,929 by calendar year  2000,  stated that the  Army  would need to  train approximately 209  specialists  each  year  to  meet  future require› ments  compared with  the  current level  of  100 officers  per  year, and  asserted  that  the  increased training requirement would  mean the  addition of  eighty-three more  in-country studies  per  year  at an  estimated cost  increase of  $3.6  million. Subsequent studies will determine how  best  to  train officers for  each  region within the  foreign area  officer specialty.

Beginning in  fiscal  year 1983,  U.S.  Army  foreign area  offi› cers  will  no  longer study Chinese at the Ministry of  Defense Chinese  Language School  (MODCLS)  in  Hong  Kong.  The  Brit› ish school  took  over  third-year foreign  area  officer  training when the United States  reduced its  presence in  Taiwan. The Army found the  school  to  be  very  structured with  no  flexibility and focused  exclusively  on  language training. The  Army  wanted  its foreign  area  officer  students to  have  third-year training designed to  meet  their  individual needs: a  mixture of  language training, area  studies, and  travel. The  British  would  not  agree. The  De› fense Language Institute will  provide third-year training in Chinese.

Significant  innovations in the  affiliated program also occurred at the  United  States  Army  Russian  Institute (USARI)  at Garmisch, West  Germany, and  the  U.S. Army  Institute for  Military  Assis› tance at Fort  Bragg.  The  Russian  institute  contracted with George-

town  University to provide a graduate degree in Russian  studies, which  Georgetown will conduct concurrently with  the  two-year institute program. A  one-year trial  will begin in  the  summer of 1983.  The Institute for Military Assistance started a  graduate degree  completion program with  several  North Carolina univer› sities.  The foreign area  officer course at  the  institute will count as six of  the  twenty-five hours of  credit needed for  a  master-of› arts  degree. The pilot program, a joint degree in  government with  Campbell University, began in  July 1982.  Eventually, the joint program will expand to  include area  studies, international relations, political  science,  economics, history,  anthropology, and sociology.  The Institute for  Military  Assistance planned to  inau› gurate one-year language training programs in Spanish and French in  January 1983.  The Institute for Military Assistance also  began a  visiting professors program in 1982.  Five  visiting professors drawn from  among  the  fields  involved  in  the  degree completion program will serve  on  a  oneor  two-year  basis.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

In  the  1970s,  following  the  Vietnam War,  the  Army  planned a  modernization program that  would  increase the  Army  inven› tory  by  more than 500  new  weapons and equipment systems. According  to General Donald  R. Keith,  the  commanding general of the  Army  Materiel  Development and  Readiness Command, it would  be  the  largest modernization program "in  the  history of the  Army."  During fiscal  year  1982,  this  program was beginning to pay  important dividends-thanks to budget increases in  1981 and 1982-as the M 1 Abrams tank, the Black Hawk  tactical helicopter, the  new  Stinger air  defense weapon,  and  the  Bradley fighting vehicle,  along  with  other items,  reached the  field.

The  purpose of this  program, as explained by Lt. Gen.James H. Merryman, General  Keith's  successor  as Deputy  Chief  of  Staff for  Research, Development, and  Acquisition, was  to  modernize an  army  that  had  fallen  increasingly further behind the  armies of  the  Warsaw  Pact  nations. This  situation had  developed in  the 1970s during which  the  Soviet  Union exceeded U.S.  production outlays for weapons and equipment by  about 75  percent and outspent the United States for research and development by more  than  50 percent. There was, however,  more  to the  modern› ization  program than  simply  bringing the  Army  up  to standards after  a period of  neglect; an  army  that  is to  maintain itself  in  the years  ahead must  press  forward with  a program of research and development today,  if it is to field  the  weapons and  equipment it will need tomorrow.

In  planning for  the  conduct of  future operations against  nu› merically  strong, well-equipped forces  such  as those  of  the  War› saw Pact  nations, the  Army  in  1981 developed the  concept  of the AirLand Battle. Under this  concept the  Army  described an  ex› tended battlefield in  which  there would  be  an  integrated use  of conventional, nuclear, chemical, and  electronic means  to  attack an  enemy  "to  the  full  depth of  his formations." Basing  its projec› tions  on  an  intelligence estimate of  the  nature of  Warsaw  Pact forces  to  the  year 2000  and  beyond, the  Army  sought to  ascer› tain  its  weapons and equipment needs for  the AirLand Battle 2000.  The  Army  set  out  to  meet  these  needs  in  its  research and

development program for  the  next  decade,  building on  the  work already under way.

The  Army's  operational and  technological projections were, of  course, simply  predictions and  not  revelations of  things cer› tain to  come, but they were  based on  experience and on  the Army's  best estimates  of what  contemporary developments meant for  the  near future.

As Eric  C. Ludrigsen noted  in a recent  issue of Army, a histori› cally interesting and  significant aspect  of the  modernization pro› gram  is that  it appeared at inception to be system  oriented rather than manpower oriented. That is,  it  seemed to  look  more and more  toward  substituting machines  for  manpower, in contrast to past  tradition in  which  the  Army,  composed largely  of  marching infantry,  was clearly labor  intensive.  In  the  years  ahead,  it seemed likely  that in  the  Army,  as  was always  the  case  in  the  Navy  and Air  Force,  machines would  be  paramount.

As might  be expected, the  Army's  modernization program is enormously expensive  and  takes  place  during a period  of several years  in which  the  Army's  share  of  the  defense budget has  been shrinking. When  Congress passed the 1983  defense authoriza› tion  in  the  summer of  1982,  it cut  the  Army's  procurement bud› get  request by 4.35  percent. In  spite  of  this,  procurement funds for  fiscal  year 1983  increased over  those  of  fiscal  year 1982.

In  common parlance, procurement is the  step  following  re› search  and  development (R&amp;D). Today's  Army,  however,  thinks in  terms  of  research, development, and  acquisition, a  term  that encompasses the  complex life  cycle of  Army  materiel from  con› ceptualization through validation, development, production, and deployment. Conceptualization grows  out  of  the  study  of  threat projections, technological forecasts,  and  determinations concern› ing  potential equipment or  materiel systems,  including complex weapons, that would be  useful to  the Army  under known  or projected circumstances. In  the  validation phase,  the  Army  veri› fies preliminary designs  and  engineering plans,  resolves  or  mini› mizes  identifiable logistical problems, and in  general validates the  concept  for  full-scale  development. During  the  development phase the Army  generates, engineers, fabricates, and tests  an item,  after  which  it decides  whether or  not  to accept  the  item  into the  inventory. Finally,  in  the  production and  deployment phase, the  Army  trains  the  operational units  to use  the  item,  procures it, and  then  distributes it to  the  field.  This  phase  is a long  process  of applied  science, manufacturing, and  distribution. At various  steps in  this process, several important official committees become involved.

## Research

The  Defense Science  Board (DSB),  the  senior advisory body in  the  Department of  Defense, consists  of  thirty-three members, including the  chairmen of  the  primary public  advisory commit› tees  of  the three military departments as  ex  officio members. The  thirty members-at-large are  appointed for  four-year terms and  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  their preeminence in  the  fields  of science  and  engineering, including management and  long-range planning. A group of  senior consultants, also  outstanding scien› tists  and engineers, assists  the  board in  its  deliberations. Under the  direction of  the  Undersecretary of Defense for  Research and Engineering (USDRE),  the  DSB  forms various task  forces com› posed  of  board members, senior consultants, and  other experts to study questions raised by  the Secretary of Defense, the Undersecretary, and  the  Chairman of  the  Joint Chiefs  of  Staff. When a  study is  completed, the task forces present a  formal briefing to  the board and to  appropriate DOD  officials. They also  submit a  written report to  the USDRE  for  approval and forwarding to  the Secretary of  Defense and Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of  Staff that contains findings, recommendations, and  a  suggested implementation plan. After final  approval, the report is  published and distributed to  concerned government agencies and other organizations. Durng fiscal year 1982  ap› proved recommendations focused on  the  responsiveness of  uni› versities to  defense research needs, very  high speed integrated circuits, forward area laser weapons, and structural hardening of  the  B-52.

At the  Army  level,  the  Army  Science  Board (ASB) advises  the Secretary of  the  Army  and  Chief  of  Staff  on  research and  devel› opment directions and programs, on  system  acquisition policies and procedures, and on  other matters affected by  science and engineering. During the  past  year,  ad  hoc  subgroups and  review panels  checked  on  the  status  of  the  Deputy Secretary of  Defense's Acquisition Improvement Program and  worked on  new  ways  to improve  the  Army's  acquisition process.  These groups also exam› ined  options for  using the  limited number of  Roland fire units and  missiles  that  will be  delivered to  the  Army  with  the  close-out of  the  U.S.  Roland program, and  assessed  the  potential of  artifi› cial intelligence and  robotics  technologies in  meeting Army  needs relative to battlefield technology, research and technology insertion, management of  research and  development personnel, and  plant  automation. They  also  focused on  means  to ensure the smooth  operation and  maintenance of  new,  more advanced sys-

terns  in  terms of  personnel qualifications, training, hardware, operational burdens on  weapon  systems,  and  systematic  changes pertinent to  the  overall process  of  research, development, and acquisition. The Army Science Board sponsored studies on terrorism, including the  problems of  hostages,  terrorist arsenals, terrorist incidents, the  plausibility  of  mass destruction terrorism, and  the  use  of  bacteriological and chemical warfare agents by terrorists. The  board  also examined past  and  present hyperveloc› ity technology  and  special  armor programs and  investigated gen› eral principles dealing with  the impact of  complex battlefield software systems.  Two  summer studies were  conducted in  Au› gust 1982.  The first took  up the  acquisition and retention of Army  scientists  and engineers, both military and civilian.  The second  reviewed the  Army's  Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Army  (RDT&amp;EA), programs on  chemical warfare and  biological  defense, including content, balance,  funding, sup› port  facilities,  and management.

The  Advanced  Concepts  and  Technology Committee (ACT), a high-level group of scientists, engineers, and professional Army  officers  representing ODCSRDA,  ODCSOPS,  ODCSPER, TRADOC,  DARCOM,  and  the  Army  Research Institute, is  re› sponsible  for  evaluating unsolicited proposals received  from  pri› vate  industry that  have  significant potential for  the  Army.  Dur› ing  fiscal year  1982,  ACT  funded twenty-nine different projects conducted by  firms  under contracts signed  with  the  Army's  de› velopment commands for a  total of  $5.9  million .  Areas under investigation  included an  advanced  tunable  laser,  a rocket-assisted kinetic  energy projectile, a synthetic  aperture radar, elimination of  tail  rotor on  helicopters, ceramic turbines, polymeric micro› electronics, nitramine propellant, and  a solid-state near  millime› ter  wavelength source.

The  Laser  Weapons  Technology program for  fiscal year  1982 continued to  emphasize early demonstration of  laser weapon concepts  and  advancement of  the  high-energy laser  technology base.  Primary  technology accomplishments were  the  initiation of ultraviolet preionization laser experiments, construction of  a propagation cell  for performing in-house experiments, assess› ment of  in-band laser damage, continuation of prime power development at  MICOM  (U.S.  Army  Missile Command) in  con› junction with  MERADCOM  (Mobility  Equipment Research and Development Command) and  ERADCOM  (Electronics  Research and  Development Command), and  the  conduct of joint Army› Navy hot  spot  tracking experiments.

Two contracters, Hughes  and  TRW,  continued with  the  com-

petitive preliminary design for the forward area laser  weapon, demonstrator (F  AL  W-D), but  Congress cut  the  funding for  the program, causing its  suspension.

A contract was  let  to  Westinghouse on  1 April 1982  for  the design and fabrication of  the Roadrunner, which  will  demon› strate the  close  combat laser  assault weapon (CCLA W) concept. The  preliminary design review  was held  in  September 1982.  On 29 July 1982  the House Armed Services  Committee blocked a request to  move  CCLA W  to  a  separate program and  added the funds to  the  laser  weapons technology program. The  authoriza› tion  bill  of  8  September 1982  affirmed this  action.

The U.S.  Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES)  carried out  a  successful program in  the area of  military engineering research and  development, military hydrology, and civil works  engineering research and  development during fiscal year  1982.  Among the  more  significant projects was the  demon› stration of a new  antiarmor obstacle  using  a developmental blast› ing  agent. It involved pumping a  slurry explosive into buried pipe, detonating it,  and creating a  ditch. In  the  demonstration neither an  armored personnel carrier nor an  M  48  tank could cross  the  blasted barrier. A  microprocessor-based procedure to forecast  tactical  streamflow was developed and  tested.  In  addition, two  initiatives were begun under the Dredging Operations Technical Support Program-one would  address the  long-term impact  of dredged material disposal,  while  the  other  would  evalu› ate disposal alternatives and would document existing proce› dures for  predicting the  effects of  contaminated dredged mate› rial  on  the  environment.

WES's  Aquatic Plant Research Program provides assistance to  Corps of  Engineer districts, to  state and local  agencies, and across  U.S.  borders to  the  governments of  Panama and  Canada. During fiscal year 1982,  an evaluation was  completed on the effectiveness of  introducing three insects and a  pathogen into Louisiana  waterways  to control the  growth  of the  water  hyacinth, which  was clogging  the  state's  rivers  and  lakes.  The  study  showed that, since  the project began in 1977,  the proliferation of  the water  hyacinth had  been  checked and  that  the  area  of  its infesta› tion  had  been  reduced from 1.75  million  acres  to  350,000 acres.

The Corps of  Engineer's Cold  Regions Research and  Engi› neering Laboratory (CRREL)  coordinated the  SNOW-ONE-A field experiment, which was  conducted at the Vermont Army Na› tional  Guard's Ethan  Allen  Training Center in Jericho, Vermont, from  30 November 1981  through 23 February 1982.  As with  the previous year's SNOW-ONE experiment, SNOW-ONE-A had  the

objective  of  addressing problems posed by  the  winter environ› ment  on  the  performance of electro-optical and  millimeter-wave systems. Specific goals of the experiment, which were met successfully, were  to  expand the  data base  for  electromagnetic energy propagation through falling  and  blowing  snow  that  had been initiated during SNOW-ONE, document the influence of snow cover  on  look-down  sensor  performance, conduct  a prelimi› nary  winter-battlefield dust  and debris subtest, and  carry  out  a helicopter-induced obscuration subtest.

Construction of  CRREL's Frost Effects Research Facility moved  forward during fiscal  year 1982,  and the  structure was expected to  be  ready for  use  in  the  winter of  1984-1985. The 29,000-square-foot building will house twelve  test  basins,  an  in› strumentation and  operation room, a  mechanical and  electrical equipment room, and a  storage and staging aisle.  The facility will permit seasonal  and  perennial (permafrost) frozen-soil con› ditions  to be created and  maintained artificially, and  will provide the  capability  to assess,  under controlled conditions, the  effect  of winter conditions on  the durability of  engineering structures, such  as  foundations, pavements, and  underground utility  lines. The  new  facility  will  substantially improve the  reliability of  test data  because research projects will no  longer be  dependent on the  vagaries  of weather; it will also increase research productivity since  the structures under examination can  be  subjected to  a number of  winter test  cycles  each  year.

## Ballistic  Missile  Defense

The  Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program gained  increased significance in 1982 when  the  Reagan  administration announced its  strategic modernization plan on  2  October 1981.  This plan would  terminate multiple protective shelter (MPS) basing  of  the Air  Force's MX intercontinental ballistic  missile  (ICBM); direct immediate deployment of  100  MXs  in  U.S.  Minuteman ICBM silos as a temporary means  of improving strategic  capability; and direct  further research and  development on  BMD and  two other potential basing  options, one  or  more  of  which  would  be  chosen in  1984 for  increasing long-term survivability of  the  missile.  The US. Congress  moved  up  the  decision  date  to July  1983, and  then to  December 1982.

The  BMD  program manager and  deputy program manager relocated from Huntsville, Alabama, to  the  BMD  Program Of› fice  in  Washington, D.C.  The purpose of  the move  was  to  im› prove efficiency in responding to increased management de-

mands from Washington. At  the same  time  as  the relocation, which  occurred in  September 1982,  command of  the  organiza› tion's  Ballistic  Missile  Defense Systems  Command (BMDSCOM) in Huntsville, a  dual function of  the program manager since 1976,  reverted to  a  separate position.

In 1982  the  BMD  organization was  authorized 106  military and  523 civilian spaces . Funding obligations  totaled  $596,948,233 and  included $125,473,224 for  the  Advanced Technology Pro› gram,  $333,061,981 for  the  Systems  Technology Program, and $138,413,028 for  the  Kwajalein Missile  Range.

Responding to  the  President's strategic modernization deci› sion,  BMD  management in  1982  reassessed and  reoriented the Systems  Technology and Advanced Technology programs. A balance  was sought  between two major  objectives:  first,  the  pres› ervation of  cost-effective defense options which  could  be  devel› oped  and  deployed rapidly  to meet  near-term objectives  with  low development risk;  and  second,  the  maturation of advanced tech› nology  systems  concepts which  could counter projected Soviet threat growth  and  still  be  cost  effective .

Attention was  focused on  two  major efforts within the  Sys› tems  Technology Program: (1)  the preprototype program in progress since  1979  to  demonstrate technology associated with an  endoatmospheric low-altitude defense (LoAD)  system  capa› ble  of  defending land-based ICBMs  deployed in  MPS  or  fixed silos; and  (2) the  homing overlay  experiment (HOE)  concerning technology for  a  nonnuclear exoatmospheric interceptor. Work also  continued on  other aspects  of  the  program: advanced sys› tems  analysis,  systems  definition studies, development of  threat and  weapon effects  data, evaluation of  BMD  in  relation to  cur› rent  proposals resulting from  strategic arms  limitation or  reduc› tion  talks,  and formulation of  options for  the  second of  the  re› views required every  five years  on  the  Antiballistic  Missile Treaty. The strategic evaluations supported systems  definition studies and  also  provided responses to  requests from  the  Army's  Office of the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations and  Plans,  Office  of the  Undersecretary of  Defense for  Research and  Engineering, Offic e of  Director of  Defense Program Analysis  and  Evaluation, and  the  Arms  Control and  Disarmament Agency .

Activity  was stepped up  for  the  LoAD  effort, which  was given the  name  Sentry  in April  1982 and  later  altered to Sentry-D. The Sentry  Project  Office  performed extensive  analyses  to determine BMD effectiveness  in defense  of the  MX in various  basing  modes, including closely  spaced basing (CSB).  The office also  partici› pated in  MX  basing studies with  the  Air  Force  Ballistic  Missile

Office-BMD Core  Group  and  with  the  Air  Force  staff  panels . On 14 June 1982,  the  Secretary of  Defense issued  formal directions reorienting the Sentry effort from support of  the MPS-based MX  to  the MX  in  a  CSB  mode. Management then redirected development of major  components, such  as the  interceptor, radar, and  data  processor, for  the  system  to address specific  issues  pecu› liar  to  CSB.  Testing progressed on  the  major  components, most of  which  were  based on  technology proven in  the Site  Defense and  other programs .  The accelerated and restructured Sentry effort  was designed to  support the  fiscal year  1983 decision  called for  in  the  President's plan  regarding a U.S.  strategic deployment option.

Development progressed rapidly  on  the  vehicles  for  the  sched› uled  HOE  flight  tests,  which  would  decide  technical  issues  associ› ated with  optical homing and nonnuclear kill  capability in  the exoatmosphere. Special  emphasis at  all  management levels  re› solved problems encountered during 1981  in  developing the long wavelength infrared homing sensor, and fabrication was completed on  several  sensors. Calibration of  the  flight-I homing sensor  was concluded in August  and  begun  on  the  flight-2  sensor, which  will also  be  used as  a  backup for  flight 1. Structural ele› ments  were  finished for  some HOE flight  vehicles.  Systems  tests were  completed for  the  first HOE  flight  vehicle  (FTV-01) and started on  the  second. Flight  preparations began  using  FTV-01, and  refinement of  launch operational procedures and  training of launch  crews  and  support personnel proceeded. Following  an in-process review to  determine its  readiness, the FTV-01 was shipped to  the Kwajalein Missile  Range.

In  systems  definition efforts to  provide U.S.  responses in  the event  of  unconstrained growth of  the  Soviet  threat, primary at› tention was given  to  pursuit of  an  endoatmospheric nonnuclear kill  (ENNK)  capability to  replace or  augment the  nuclear inter› ceptor in the Sentry system. Obvious advantages of  an ENNK system  include greater public acceptance, avoidance of  nuclear release requirements, more siting and handling flexibility, and the ability to  be  thoroughly tested. Art  intensive study of  the feasibility of  such  a  system  was  conducted from 13  November 1981  to  8  January 1982,  and the results were briefed to  the Undersecretary of  the  Army and  to  the  Office of  the  Secretary of Defense  (OSD).  Interest in  the  project led  to the  establishment of  an  ENNK task  force on  6 July 1982  to  determine top-level system performance parameters, to develop ENNK system concepts, and  to  formulate specific  technology requirements .

Also  under consideration as  a  cost-effective option of the

BMD  growth was  a  layered defense concept in  which an  exo› atmospheric defense system such as  HOE combined with an endoatmospheric underlay defense such  as  Sentry to  provide a two-tiered defense for fixed-base ICBMs  and  other high-value targets. In  the  BMD  study  initiated in  1981  to  define a  layered defense system  for  the  1990s,  three prime  contractors submitted separate concepts  for  such  a system.  In  March 1982, BMDSCOM extended the  study  of  these  proposals, which  were  (a) a concept for high-value target defense, (b)  a  concept for sea-launched ballistic missile (SLBM)  defense, and (c)  a  concept for ICBM defense.

InJune 1982,  in  response to  an  inquiry from  OSD,  the  BMD program manager established the  Spartan Defense  System  Task Force  to determine the  efficacy  of  the  Spartan missile  in  defense of  the  MX  ICBM  deployed in  a  CSB  mode. Using  Spartan for this  purpose was  appealing since  both the missile  and its  war› head  had  already been  developed and  thoroughly tested, and  a number of  both had  been  stockpiled when  the  Safeguard BMD system  was deactivated. Using  Spartan, however,  required defini› tion  of  a  system  to  perform those  functions previously done  by other components of  the Safeguard system.  The task  team  de› fined such  a  system  based on  existing hardware, and it  deter› mined Spartan's effectiveness in  defending the MX  in  a  CSB mode against a  number of plausible attack scenarios. Results were  given  to  OSD  in  September 1982.

The  Simple-Novel System  Working Group  was established in July 1982  to evaluate rapidly deployable concepts for  defense of CSB.  Analysis  of  two  concepts, conventional guns  and  environ› mental dust, was  completed before the  end  of  the  year.

In  August 1982,  the  Systems  Technology Project  Office  initi› ated  phase II  of  the  Airborne Optical  Adjunct Study  in  which  a versatile, multimission threat acquisition system would be  de› fined  and  a development program planned for  a  tactical  proto› type  demonstration.

In the Advanced Technology Program, conducted by  the BMD  Advanced Technology Center (BMDA TC),  management focused attention on  efforts offering substantial potential for improving BMD  capabilities. Major  technology efforts included the ENNK Technology Program, the  Designating Optical  Tracker Program, the  Forward Acquisition System  Program, the  Optical Aircraft Measurements Program, the Miniature Kill  Vehicle Program, the  Distributed Data  Processing Program, and  the  Co› bra  Judy program.

Operating under a  severely constrained budget, BMDA TC

limited its  F.NNK  efforts to  establishing key  technologies that were  critical to  the operation and effectiveness of  the system. Concept  definition studies  determined an  ENNK  capability. In› stallation  of  radar was completed at  the  Kwajalein  Missile Range for  use  in collecting  ENNK  data.  By direction of the  Undersecre› tary  of  the  Army, BMDA TC  began  planning for  an  expanded ENNK  development program to provide a  broad technology base  from which  lower-risk ENNK  systems  of  the  future could be  constructed.

A successful  flight  of BMDA TC's  Designating  Optical  Tracker Program was  concluded in  August 1982.  This flight, as  well  as previous  ones,  progressively demonstrated the  capability  of  long› wavelength infrared sensors to  perform more  complex, generic BMD functions under realistic engagement geometry and  envi› ronmental conditions. Additional flights  are  planned.

Significant progress was  made in  the Forward Acquisition System Program, designed to resolve  critical  system  and  technol› ogy issues  associated  with  the  BMD  forward acquisition function through comprehensive ground testing. Critical design reviews were  completed, and system,  subsystem, and interface perfor› mance  specifications  were  published. However,  this  program was terminated at  the  end  of  fiscal year  1982 to make  funds  available for  a  higher-priority program.

Several  milestones  were  achieved  in the  Optical  Aircraft Mea› surements Program in 1982.  In the aircraft platform area, a Boeing , 707b  aircraft was  purchased from American Airlines through an  Air Force contract and was  delivered to  Wright› Patterson Air  Force Base,  Ohio, in  March. In  June 1982,  the 60-percent design review  of  the  aircraft hangar was  conducted satisfactorily.  Separate contracts  were  awarded for  the  focal plane array  development and  the  sensor  integration effort.  The  prelimi› nary  design  review  of  the  focal  plane  array  was done  in  Septem› ber  1982.  In  August 1982,  the  Army  and  the  Air  Force  signed  a memorandum of  agreement outlining their respective responsi› bilities  and roles  in  the  program.

In  the Miniature Kill  Vehicle Program, BMDA TC  success› fully  tested lightweight motors and  designed a  more advanced optical  sensor. Management identified the  most  expensive items in the  technology  areas  in order to cut  potential production costs.

Cobra  Judy, a  shipborne S-band phased array signature in› strumentation radar system, underwent rigorous testing and evaluation before becoming fully operational in 1982. The system's  performance was outstanding. In  fiscal year  1983, it will be  transferred to  the  U.S.  Air  Force  Eastern Space  and  Missile

Center. Specifications have  been finished for adding a  single› beam  X-band  radar to  the  system.  Unlike  the  basic  system  which was jointly funded, the  modification is to  be  completely funded by  BMD,  and  then all  funds for  operating the  modified system are  to  be  provided by  the  Air  Force.

A number of  projects completed in  1982 improved Kwajalein Missile Range (KMR) capabilities.  A high-speed digital  data  trans› mission  link  set  up  between Lexington, Massachusetts, and  the missile  range provided almost  immediate delivery of  mission in› formation to  Lexington for data reduction operations. Crypto equipment, incorporated at  the terminals of  the  link, ensured secure  communications. A multistatic measurements system,  de› veloped  under  joint BMDA TC  and  KMR  sponsorship, improved calculation of  the pierce point of a  reentry vehicle as  well  as flight diagnostics. This system uses multiple remote sites for tristatic reception of  TRADEX L-band radar echoes as  well  as bistatic  echoes  of  the  Advanced Research Projects  Agency's  long› range tracking and  instrumentation radar (ALT AIR)  UHF  sig› nals  for  signature analysis  and netted defense technology tests. Modifications to  the  ALT AIR  made  it a fully  operational contri› buting sensor of  the  Air  Force Detection and  Tracking System. Also completed was installation of  a millimeter-wave instrumen› tation radar. When this system, a  BMDATC project begun in 1981, is fully  calibrated, it will collect  data  on  reentry targets and satellites.

In 1982,  the missile  range successfully completed develop› ment of the C-7  A  Terminal Area Support Aircraft and the Kwajalein-Broad Ocean Area Tugboat projects in  support of MX testing.  In  engineering tests  using  two targets  of opportunity, the  aircraft and  tugboat demonstrated terminal area  scoring  with the  Sonobuoy Missile  Impact Location System  (SMILS),  teleme› try  with  a  wide-angle luneberg lens,  and optics  with  streak and motion picture cameras. A  Department of Energy vessel  was leased  to  reference the  SMILS  array geodetically. The  availabil› ity  of  land reference in  the  Marshall Islands allows  the  MX  im› pact  area to  be  extremely accurate for  reentry vehicle  scores.

In 1982,  negotiations regarding present and future use  of the  KMR  continued between the U.S.  and the Republic of  the Marshall  Islands (RMI),  one  of  the  self-governing entities which make  up  the  Trust Territory of  the  Pacific  Islands. On  30  May 1982,  U.S.  and RMI  officials signed an  agreement to  end the 35-year  U.S.  trusteeship. When  ratified by the  United States  and the Marshall Islands, this Compact of  Free Association would recognize  the  islands'  autonomy but  would  give the  United States

extensive access  to  K  wajalein and other Marshall Islands over the  next  fifty  years  in  exchange for  $1.5  billion  in  economic aid and  rent.  An  interim agreement provided continued U.S.  access pending ratification of the compact. On 18 June 1982, the Kwajalein  Atoll  Corporation, an  association of  Kwajalein  land› owners, began an  organized occupation on  two  major KMR installations, primarily to  protest the  terms  of the  compact.  Since the  demonstration was illegal according  to the  interim  agreement, the  U.S.  waited  for  RMI  and  the  landowners to  settle  the  matter themselves. However, when  the  issue  remained unsettled, the United  States  began  discussions  with  the  RMI  and  the  landown› ers  on  2 September 1982 in an  attempt to determine what  issues needed to  be  resolved to  end the  demonstration. These discus› sions  set  the  stage  for  further negotiations in  Washington, D.C., in  October 1982.

## Command, Control, and  Surveillance

During  fiscal year  1982,  the  Army  continued its participation in  the Joint Tactical  Communications Program, known  as TRI › T AC,  and achieved another major milestone in  the successful completion  of the  production decision  process  and  contract  award for  the  Family  of  Digital  Group Multiplexer Program. The  start of  production for  this  major  element of  TRI-TAC, in  conjunc› tion  with  the  ongoing Army  manufacture of  the AN/TYC - 39 and  AN/TTC - 39  switches,  will provide our  tactical  forces  with secure, reliable transmission of  tactical command and control data,  voice,  and  message  traffic  communications. The  Army  also received  and  accepted  its first production quantities  of the  C-6709 basic net radio  interface  device and  successfully fielded  the  C-6709 in Europe . Progress  continued on  the  de velopment of other  ma› jor elements  of  TRI-TAC. Specificall y, the  Army  Communica› tions  Development Laboratories fabricated an  improved version of  the  existing AN/TSC - 58,  now  called  the  Improved Message Facility  (IMF).  The IMF  was  tested and received favorable re› views in a live-exercise  scenario. The  IMF  will now  be  fielded  in lieu  of  developing a longer and  more  expensive alternative , will result in savings  of  hundreds of millions of  dollars, and will provide an earlier capability to our fighting forces. Other Army  TRI-TAC programs, such  as  the  Single  Subscriber Ter› minal,  will enter operational testing and  will soon  be  ready  for production.

In  November 1981, Congress  terminated development of the Standoff  Target Acquisition System  (SOT AS) because  of its high

cost. Congress  agreed, however,  that  a SOT AS-like  capacity-the ability  to  see  what an  enemy or  potential enemy  was  doing  be› hind  its borders or  frontlines-was needed; it directed the  Army to seek a  less expensive system to provide this "see-deep" capability. The  Army  examined various alternatives to  SOT AS, concluded that less  costly alternatives were available, and de› signed a  program to  develop them. Meanwhile, the Air  Force was  pursuing a  program of  its  own,  Pave  Mover, which  would possess,  among other features, radar-guided weapons delivery. On  19 May  1982,  the  Undersecretary of  Defense for  Research and Engineering (USDRE)  directed the Army and Air Force development programs to merge in order to provide a  basic radar that  could  be  expanded to  satisfy  each  service's  wide-angle surveillance  and  weapons guidance requirements, thereby reduc› ing  the duplication that would  be  inevitable with  two  separate programs.

The resultant program, the  Joint Surveillance and Target Attack  Radar  System  Qoint  STARS),  was financed by funds  pro› grammed for the two  parent programs-Battlefield Data  Sys› tems  and Pave  Mover .  The Air  Force appointed the program manager, and  the  Army  named the  deputy program manager. A Joint Program Office QPO),  staffed with  Army  and  Air  Force personnel along with appropriate technicians and administra› tors from the civilian sector, was  established at Hanscom Air Force Base  in  Massachusetts, with  a  subelement at Fort Mon› mouth, New  Jersey. Since  the  JPO began work  in  June 1982, four  radar contractors have  been  directed to examine  the  feasibil› ity  of  designing a  single radar to  be  carried on  the  TR-1 and OV-lD platforms (these  studies  were  completed and  reviewed  by the JPO  on  3 Setember 1982).  Furthermore, the  JPO has  begun to  prepare general specifications for  the Joint STARS  radar and system; the Motornla ground station, designed in  the SOT AS program and  practically  completed, has  been  evaluated for  appli› cability  as the Joint STARS  ground station; and  preparation has started on  the  Program Management Plan,  which  would  include acquisition  strategy  and  concomitant cost  and  schedule estimates.

Tactical  Satellite (T ACSA T)  Communications Terminals are being developed to  support Army and Marine Corps mobile ground forces by  providing reliable communications between widely  dispersed and  rapidly moving  forces.  Each  system  uses  a communications satellite  as a  relay  station  between two  terminals, thereby eliminating the need for a  line of sight between the terminals. In the initial phase of  the  TACSATCOM program, two single-channel and  one  multichannel system  will be  fielded.

The single-channel systems will  operate in the ultrahigh fre› quency (UHF)  range, while  the  multichannel system  will func› tion  in  the  super high  frequency range. The  single-channel Spe› cial Communications system (AN/MSC- 64) is in full-scale production and will provide secure command and control communications from  the  National  Command Authority to vari› ous  special  units  worldwide. The  single-channel manpack (AN/ PSC-3)  will support ranger and  special  forces  units. A produc› tion  contract for  the  AN/PSC-3 has  been  awarded. The  Multi› channel Initial System  (MCIS),  or  AN/TSC - 85A  and  93A,  pro› vides  super high frequency communications down  to  brigade level.  Low-rate multiplexers and  antijam modules  will be  added to  fielded systems  following  procurement in  1985.  In  the  objec› tive  phase,  one  single-channel and  one  multichannel system  will be  fielded .  The Single Channel Objective Tactical Terminal (SCOTT), currently in  advanced development, is an  extremely high  frequency (EHF)  system,  and  fielding  depends on  the  avail› ability  of  an  EHF  satellite. The Multichannel Objective System (MCOS),  also  an  EHF  system,  is  still  in  the  concept validation stage.

Fiscal  year 1982  began with  the Single Channel Ground › Airborne Radio  Subsystem  (SINCGARS)  still in advanced devel› opment with  three competitors: Rockwell-Collins, Cincinnati Electronics,  and  ITT. The  Army  dropped Rockwell-Collins  after the  Electromagnetic Environmental Test  Facility, a subactivity  of the  Test  and Evaluation Command, determined that the  Army did  not  need the  technology being  developed in  the  Rockwell› Collins  system . DARCOM  and  the  Army  staff  investigated ways to increase  the  production rate  anticipated for  SINCGARS.  Possi› ble  options ranged from dual-source producers for maximum rates  starting in  the  first program year  to  accepting the  single› source,  slow rate  of  production previously approved. After  four months of  effort, the Army  decided that the option it  could afford for  SINCGARS  during this  fiscal  year  was to increase the production rate, although not  as  significantly as desired, and  to begin  dual-source production later .

As  a  separate action, the  Army decided in  the summer of 1982  to  delete the aircraft radio version from SINCGARS development. This  action  followed  DARCOM's  and  TRADOC's proposal that  the  Army  modify  the  existing  AN/ARC-186 to  be compatible with  SINCGARS. DARCOM  has  assigned develop › ment  of the  modified  AN/ ARC- 186 to the Aviation  Research  and Development Activity  (A  VRADA) .

The Army, with Marine Corps participation, conducted a

successful  operational test  II  on  the  Position  Location Reporting System (PLRS) during the  period October to  December 1981. The  Marine  Corps  performed additional testing  for  amphibious forces  at  Camp  Lejeune, North Carolina, in January 1982.  De› spite  the  successful tests,  Congress denied production funding for  fiscal year  1982 because  of unresolved development problems. The Army  responded by  restructuring the PLRS program to prepare for  production in  fiscal  year 1983  and  to  correct defi› ciencies  in  reliability, availability,  and  maintainability noted  dur› ing development and  operational test II  (DT-OT II). Additionally, in  the  spring of  1982,  the  Army  deployed the  system  to  the  9th Infantry Division, High Technology Test Bed, Fort Lewis, Washington, for  innovative concept  testing.  A full-scale  develop› ment  contract for  the  PLRS  test  set  was awarded in June 1982.

PLRS  was  presented to  Marine and  Army  Systems  Acquisi› tion Review  Councils III (MSARC,  30  July 1982;  ASARC, 1 September 1982) for  a production decision.  The  Army  and  Ma› rine  Corps  endorsed the  acquisition  strategy  and  approved PLRS for production. At  the ASARC  III for PLRS,  the  acquisition strategy of  the Army Data Distribution System (ADDS)  was approved, subject  to future milestone  decision  reviews.  Based  on PLRS guidance from  the  ASARC  III,  the  production request  for proposal (REP)  was amended and  forwarded to  the  contractor.

The  development contract for phase one  of  the  Advanced Field Artillery  Tactical  Data  System  (AF  A  TDS)  program -a Com› munications Control System  (CCS)  that  will be  used  on  the  cur› rent field  artillery's Tactical Fire  Direction System  (T ACFIRE) and  subsequently for  AF  A  TDS--was awarded to  Singer Libra› scope  in  May  1982.  The CSS will greatly  upgrade the  protocol interface for  current digital  communications with  T ACFIRE  and will allow  both  T ACFIRE and  AF A  TDS  to  use  communication technology from  the  emerging current generation.

Regarding T ACFIRE,  Litton  received  the  final  procurement contract for  139 sets.  Fielding  of  the  system  continued on sched› ule  with  approximately 33  percent of  the  force  being  equipped with TAC FIRE.  Fielding  should  be complete  in the  third  quarter of  fiscal  year 1986.

The  third production contract for  the  ground laser  locater designator (GLLD)-for 225  units  with  an  option for  214  more in  fiscal year  1983-was awarded in July 1982.  Delivery  of  prior procurements continued, and  sixteen  GLLDs  were  fielded  to the 82d  Airborne Division. Hughes Aircraft Company received a contract for 125 laser  designator range -finder modification kits for  the  fire  suport team  vehicle  (FISTV).  Other provisions  of the

contract provided for  adapting the  GLLD  to  use  on  the  FISTV and  for  improving the  GLLD  design.

After completing force development test  and experimenta› tion  (FDTE)  at  Fort  Hood  during the  first  quarter of  fiscal year 1982, the  mortar  locating  radar,  AN/TPQ-36 (Firefinder), under› went configuration adjustments. Its conveyance  was changed  from the  M561  Gama  Goat  to  an  M35  21/2-ton truck. The antenna transceiver group was changed from  an  M116  3/4-ton  trailer to an  Ml03 11/2-ton  trailer .  The main  reason for  these  modifica› tions was the  inability  of  the  Gamma  Goat  and  the  3/4-ton  trailer to  handle the  weight  of  the  AN/TPQ - 36  and  its  antenna. The decision  was  also  made to  drop the lOKW turbine generator in favor  of a more  reliable  power  source.  The  interim  replacement, the  PU  304A  generator, is used  with  the  MPQ- 4 radar. The  new generator, which  should be  available by  fiscal  year 1985,  will consist of two MEP  112A lOKW  400 Mz diesel generators mounted on the Ml03  trailer.  First article testing  on the AN/TPQ-36 neared completion as  the  fiscal  year  ended, with  only  humidity testing left. Major  problem areas were  uncovered in  low-temperature performance, electromagnetic interference, and  water  fording. In  each  case,  corrective action was  taken and each  radar was screened  to ensure  full  operability. These  corrections resulted in improved reliability of  the  system's  hardware and  software. At year's  end, the  first set  of  radars that met  the  requirements of the  tactical  user  was  delivered to  the  field .

Regarding the  other version  of  Firefinder, the  artillery locat› ing  radar (AN/TPQ-37), six complete sets  were  shipped to  U.S. Army,  Europe (USAREUR) . Three USAREUR  divisions  under› went  new  equipment training, and  one  division  was  issued  the item.  Further issues  were  awaiting  the  receipt of  spare parts. A grid deck  failure during testing at Fort Hood led  to  a  major design  and  reengine ering  effort for  the  antenna assembly  and the subsequent replacement of all grid deck and associated hardware . To  achieve  greater durability, the  antenna transporter has  been  changed from  an  M-832 dolly  set  to  a  flatbed trailer. Contractor testing  of  the  trailer  has  been  completed, and  govern› ment  testing has  begun. Work  continued on  developing a  low› temperature quality  assurance procedure to incr ease the  reliabil› ity of  the  AN/ T PQ- 37  in  the  field.

Regarding night vision devices, production continued on man portable  common  thermal  night  sights (MCTNS):  AN/T AS-4 (TOW),  AN/T AS-5  (Dragon) , and  AN/T AS-6  (night  observation device,  long  range).  Production contracts were awarded  to Tex as Instruments to add  a missile-tracking capability to the AN/T AS-4,

using  hardware developed under a  Hughes Aircraft Company TOW 2  contract, and to convert the night sight to closed› cycle cooler  operation. Program management responsibility for MCTNS  shifted  to the  U.S. Army  Missile Command. Production of second  generation AN/PVS-5A night  vision goggles  continued in order to maintain a warm  production base  while  third genera› tion  devices  were  phased into  production. The  third generation, aviator's night  vision  imaging system  (ANVIS),  AN/AVS-6, was type  classified,  and  first  production contracts  were  awarded. The first  third-generation image  intensifier system has been  extremely well  received by  users from all  services. Engineering develop› ment  for  the  third-generation night vision  goggles,  AN/PVS-7, began, while  advanced development continued on  a  thermal viewer  (a  common module-based periscope) for drivers of  the M 1 tank  and  the  M2  and  M3  combat vehicles.

Full-scale  development of  the  remotely piloted  vehicle  (RPV) continued in  fiscal  year 1982.  The  first  series  of  RPV  flight  tests began  on  16 July 1982  at  Fort  Huachuca, Arizona. While  prob› lems  were  encountered in  two  of  the first three flights, these were  corrected, and the last  five  flights of  the eight that were conducted were  100-percent successful. Advanced development continued on  a  forward-looking infrared (FLIR) navigational system  to  enable the RPV  to  fly  at  night and under adverse weather conditions. Extended flight  testing  was conducted, with full-scale  development of  the FLIR system  expected during fis› cal  year 1984.  At  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year  the  Army Systems Acquisition  Review  Council  (ASARC)  validated  the RPV require› ment, completely funded RPV  full-scale  development, and  ap› proved  funds  for  additional sets  of  hardware for  early  user  tests and training and to  help in  the transition from research and development to  production.

The  Technical  Control  and  Analysis Center - Division (TCAC D) is designed to  manage, analyze,  and  report signal  intelligence (SIGINT) and  electronic warfare (EW)  information. It  will pro› vide  the  tactical  commander with  near  real-time information on enemy  movers,  shooters, and  electronic emitters. Each  TCAC-D system  contains three standard S-280  shelter modules mounted on  five-ton  trucks. In  each  of the  modules are  three analyst  work stations equ ipp ed with military microprocessors and the soft› ware  necessary  to support the  functions assigned  to the  particular work  station,  an  ADP  system  which  is linked  with  the  three  work stations,  a magnetic tape  unit,  a line  printer, and  a movin·g head disk.  This  modular design  enables  continuity of  operations dur› ing  a geographical move,  because  each  of the  modules can  func-

tion  either independently or  in  conjunction with  the  others. Al› though  the TCAC-D  system has experienced problems  in software development, most  have  been  resolved, and  government accep› tance  is near. Field  deployment of  the  system  is scheduled early next  year.

## Combat Support

The  ground  emplaced  mine  scattering  system (GEMSS), which is one  of  the  family  of  scatterable mines  (F  ASCAM),  continued in  development and procurement in  fiscal  year 1982.  A  com› petitive, single-year contract with fixed-price incentive was awarded to  the  AAI  corporation for  twenty-two  dispensers.

First  article  tests  on  the  extended trip  lines  for  the  M74  anti› personnel mine  were  successfully completed; first article tests were  also  successful on  the electronics assembly for the M75 antitank mine. Fiscal  year 1982  procurement contracts for  the M74  mines  were  also  awarded on  a  competitive basis.  This re› sulted in  Lockheed Corporation being selected as  a  third pro› ducer for scatterable mines in  addition to Honeywell, Incor› porated, and the  Aerojet-General Corporation. The Army  ex› pects  cost  reduction benefits from this  expansion of  the  mine production base.

Production deliveri es  of  the M712  Copperhead cannon› launched guided projectile began in  October 1981,  but early start -up  problems hampered production and  the  contractor did not  reach  the  limited  production rate  of  200  rounds per  month until  May  1982. Performance was also a problem.  During  an OSD reliability  demonstration, Copperhead achieved  a reliability  rate of  only  67  percent, well  below  the  SO-percent  rate  required by OSD for  authorization to  begin  the  economic  production rate  of 700 rounds per  month. The  Copperhead project manager took remedial action,  and  by  November 1982  the  projectile ' s reliabil› ity had  increased  to 84 percent. Production will continue through June 1984, with a three-year buy (fiscal years  1980-1982)  of 7,695 rounds compared with  the  originally planned contract quantity of  9,169.  The reduction reflected inaccurate estimates of  actual production costs and  changes  that  increased the  projectile's cost. Production equipment will be  stored.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  government of Japan signed  a production contract for  twenty-five  Copperhead projectiles  to be delivered for  testing  in June 1984.  In  addition, the  United  States and the United Kingdom began preparations for a  25-round Copperhead interoperability test  scheduled for  April 1983.

Several  actions  taken during the  past  year  helped move  the Army's  tactical  truck  program forward . Fiscal year  1982 was the second  year  of  five-year  contracts on  the  AM  General Corpora› tion five-ton and Oshkosh Truck Corporation ten-ton truck programs. Initial production testing on  both of  these vehicles began  during the  year  and  will be  completed in  early  fiscal year 1983  for  the  five-ton truck and  later on  for  the  ten-ton truck. Similar  testing  also began  on  the  AM General M915Al  line  haul tractor. Deliveries of Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nuernberg (MAN)  ten -ton  trucks to  support Pershing II and  the  ground› launched cruise  missile  (GLCM)  were  also  made .

On  13  July  1982, a competitive  four-year  contract  was awarded to General  Motors  Corporation for  53,000(  + ) commercial utility and  cargo  vehicles  (CUCV) 48,000 for  the  Army  and  the  re› mainder for  the  Air  Force  and  Marine  Corps.  The  CUCV  comes in three  basic body  styles:  utility  (resembling a Chevrolet Blazer), cargo  (pickup  truck),  and  ambulance. Vehicles  from  the  CUCV family  will replace all  of  the  M880 -series  trucks (Dodge  pickup) and those of the Ml51 1/4-ton truck fleet not replaced by the companion high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The  CUCV  program also  follows  congressional di› rection to  commercialize 20  percent of  the Ml51 1/4-ton  jeep fleet.

Additionally, there  were  significant acquisition programs for a variety  of  trailers as  well as  a  procurement of  134 lightweight trail bikes (motorcycles) for the 101st  Airborne Division (Air Assault),  the  82d  Airborne Division, and  the  6th  Cavalry  Brigade. The  request for proposal (RFP)  for  the  Swedish  BV206  small unit support vehicle  (SUSV)  was  released on  11 August 1982. The  SUSV is a fully  tracked, diesel  powered, articulated vehicle (10,500  pounds curb  weight,  3000  pounds payload)  designed to carry  platoon  materiel  and  to evacuate  wounded over  all terrains in  arctic  and  alpine locations.

The  high  mobility  multipurpose wheeled  vehicle  (HMMWV) program focused  on  development testing (DT)  and  operational testing (OT)  of  the  contractor vehicles  in  fiscal  year 1982.  As a result  of  the  development contracts signed  in July  of  1981 with AM General  Corporation, General  Dynamics  Land  Systems Divi› sion  (formerly Chrysler Defense, Incorporated), and  Teledyne Continental Motors,  eleven  prototype HMMWV s each  were  de› livered  in  April 1982  for  development testing, operational test› ing,  and  physical  teardown and  logistics  demonstration.

Development testing was conducted by  the  U.S.  Army  Test and  Evaluation Command at  Aberdeen Proving  Ground, Mary-

land,  and Yuma  Proving Ground, Arizona. Operational testing was conducted at  Hunter Liggett  Military  Reservation, California, by  the Combat Developments Experimentation Command un› der  the  auspices  of the  Operational Test  and  Evaluation Agency. Marine Corps operational testing was  conducted at  Coronado, California.  Other subtests  were  run  at  the  U .S. Army  Tank  Auto› motive Command, Warren, Michigan; Natick Laboratories, Natick,  Massachusetts; and  Fort  Bragg, North Carolina. Opera› tional testing was  completed in  September 1982,  with  develop› ment  testing extending into  October 1982.

A request for  proposal for  the  HMMWV  multiyear produc› tion  contract was released to  contractors on  22  September 1982. At  the  completion of  the  reporting period, all  three HMMWV contractors remained in the  program and  are  expected to  com› pete  for  the HMMWV five-year production contract.

Plans  to  award an  initial production contract for  the  M9  ar› mored combat earthmover during the year were delayed be› cause of a protest  filed  with  the  General  Accounting Office  (GAO) over  the  Army's intention to  continue with  the  developing con› tractor (PACCAR) during initial production, and over the decision, following  a comprehensive review  of  the  M9  program, to  reduce the planned initial production from eighty-seven in fiscal  years 1982  and 1983  to  fifteen in  fiscal  year 1982  and  to move  up  multiyear procurement from  fiscal  year 1985  to  1984. GAO  upheld the  Army's  position  on  obtaining an  initial  produc› tion  contract, and  negotiations with  PACCAR  were  resumed late in the  fiscal year . The  follow-up  multiyear procurement for  about 1,300  units  will be  awarded through competition .

The  Army  and  the  Department of  Energy (DOE)  continued production of  the  M753  improved 8-inch  nuclear projectile, but at  a slightly  slower  rate  as minor mechanical  redesigns were  made to  correct deficiencies that surfaced during testing. And  while the  prohibition on  deploying enhanced radiation warheads was in force  throughout the  year,  equipping Army  units  for  the  M753 mission  was completed in  Europe and  continued for  active  Army units  in  the  continental United States. A key  decision was  made to  equip all reserve units  for  the  M753  mission. Procurement of the  unit  equipment needed by the  reserve  components to  handle the  M7  53  will begin in  fiscal  year 1984.

Development of the improved 155-mm. nuclear projectile (XM785)  fell  behind by eleven  months because  of  congressional reductions in  the  fiscal  year 1982  budget requests for  DOE  capi› tal  equipment and  long  lead-time procurement. The  addition of eleven months to the development schedule had the positive

effect  of  eliminating the  need to  order hardware for  develop› ment  test  II  (DT  II)  and  operational test  II  (OT  II)  before com› pleting  the  engineering design  phase,  thereby  significantly  reduc› ing  the  chance for  program error. The  extra time  also  allowed the  Army  to  begin  developing an  integrated control unit  which combined several  functions and  saved  the  government $30  mil› lion  in  procurement costs.

The  Army  decided to  equip  all  reserve component units  for the  XM785  nuclear mission.  The NATO  FH70  cannon  in-bore environments were  characterized, and  verification  testing  to qual› ify the  155-mm . nuclear  projectile  for  NATO  cannons  was begun. Also,  the program to  demonstrate ballistic  similitude with  the M549  conventional projectile was started.

During  fiscal year  1982,  the  8-inch  binary  intermediate vola› tility  agent (IV A)  continued in  advanced development, which was also  begun on  a  medium altitude proximity (MAP)  fuse  to support  the 8-inch binary  program. Regarding  the multiple  launch rocket  system (MLRS) binary  program, which  also  continued in advanced  development, the  Vought Corporation received  a con› tract  for  the  integration, design,  development, and  testing  of the concept definition hardware. Furthermore, construction began in November 1981  on  the 155-mm .  projectile facility  at Pine Bluff,  Arkansas. Completion of  the  facility  is scheduled for  De› cember 1984.

## Missiles and Air  Defense

The  Hellfire modular missile  system (HMMS), an  evolution› ary  system  to accommodate a family  of  terminal homing  seekers placed  on  a common  airframe, was type  classified  as standard by the  Army  Systems  Acquisition Review  Council  (ASARC)  in  No› vember 1981.  Although Hellfire is a  major system,  the  Under› secretary of Defense waived review by  the Defense Systems Acquisition Review  Council  (DSARC),  and  authority for  a  pro› duction decision  was  returned to  the  Army.  The Vice  Chief  of Staff approved Hellfire for production, and contracts were awarded  to Martin  Marietta  Corporation for  Hellfire laser  seek› ers  and  to  Rockwell  International Corporation for  680  Hellfire missiles  and 135 launchers .

In  tests  of the  Hellfire conducted during the  year,  three  war› heads functioned normally at impact, but one missile  fell  far short  of  the  target, demonstrating that  the  fuse  had  remained in the  safe condition as required by the  actual  trajectory. The  struc › tural  feasibility  of  installing four Hellfire launchers and  sixteen

missiles on  the  Black Hawk  UH-60A helicopter  was demonstrated by Sikorsky  Aircraft with  support from  Rockwell  International Corporation and  the  Hellfire/GLD Project  Office.  The  feasibility of launching  from  the  Black  Hawk  was successfully demonstrated at  Redstone Arsenal. The  Environmental Storage Program was initiated in  August 1982  by  delivering six  missiles  in  containers and  four  launchers to  both  the  Tropic and  Arctic  Test  Centers. Two  ballistic  missiles  were successfully launched to  verify the redesigned latch  on  the  lightweight launcher, which  will be  the production launcher.

Hellfire's engineering development program, which  was con› cluded  in  August 1982,  was an  outstanding success  from  both  a technical  and  cost  standpoint. The HMMS met  or  exceeded ev› ery criteria  specified  in the  materiel  need  document except  weight (99.8 pounds actual  weight  was slightly  more  than  the  goal of  95 pounds). The  project manager and  TRADOC  agreed to  accept the  higher weight

Several  improvements to the  Hellfire  were  begun  during the year.  These included work  on  a  minimum smoke  motor,  a seal› able container, an  improved autopilot, a change  in  the  design  of the  wire  harnesses, and  several  design  advancements in  the  laser seeker.  The prime  contractor started developing AN/USM-410 software and adapters for the depot-level repair of Hellfire launchers. In  addition, efforts were  made  to improve the  design of  the  test  program sets  developed for  intermediate-level avia› tion  maintenance of  the  launcher. The High  Technology Test Bed  at  Fort  Lewis,  Washington, will test  two  prototype ground› launched Hellfire systems  early  in  fiscal  year 1983.

Substantial increases in  estimated production costs  for the Pershing II  missile-program acquisition unit  cost  rose  by  56.8 percent, and the  unit cost  for  procurement in  fiscal  year 1982 increased by  29.5  percent-did not  deter the  Army  from  push› ing  forward. In  June 1982  a  contract was  signed with  Martin Marietta for the production in  fiscal  year 1982  of  twenty-one missiles and  associated ground support equipment with  the  op› tion  of  purchasing an  additional ninety-one missiles  and  ground support equipment in  fiscal year  1983. On  22July 1982, the  first engineering development flight  of  the  Pershing II  failed  seven› teen  seconds  into  the  flight. The  cause  of  the  failure, a  leak  in the  forward dome  of  the  first-stage motor  case,  was a  relatively minor problem that did not require redesigning the case; however,  there  was a two-month delay  in the  flight  test  program while  corrections were made. By  the  end of  fiscal  year 1982, the  engineering development program was  about 75  percent

completed, and  close  to 95  percent of  the  qualification tests  were done.

Pending availability of  the Pershing II, work  progressed on Pershing Ia modifications to  extend the  missile's  operational life. Improvements to  the  erector-launcher, hoisting  beams,  and  pro› grammer test  station and  power station adaption kits,  begun in July 1981,  were  completed during the  past  year.  The increased reliability of  the  system  seen  in  fiscal  year 1981  continued, and the  operational readiness rate  of  the  Pershing Ia was the  highest of  any system managed by  the U.S.  Army Missile  Command (MICOM).  Maintaining high  readiness and  reliability  will require increased attention as  the availability of  spare parts becomes a critical problem during the remaining years of Pershing I deployment. The  aging  system  is outdated from  a technological standpoint, and  many  vendors no  longer  manufacture some  parts used  in  the  system's hardware.

Improvements to  the  basic  tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW)  system,  called  TOW 2,  will  enable this  sys› tem  to  defeat anticipated threats from enemy armor and also preserve the Army's large investment in its primary infantry heavy  assault weapon. Over 300,000 TOW  missiles  have  been produced for  the  Army, the  U.S.  Marine Corps, and  the  armed services  of  forty  foreign countries. The  development of  TOW  2 culminated in  October 1981  with  a decision to  begin production of  TOW  2  missiles  and modification kits  to  convert basic  TOW launchers to  the  TOW 2 configuration. Contracts were  awarded in  fiscal  year 1982  to  procure a  total  of  12,600  TOW 2  missiles and  2,852 launcher modification kits.  These items  are  in  pro› duction, .  nd a first deliveries are planned for early 1983.  The overall  TOW  improvement program is managed by  MICOM  at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Advances in  the warhead are di› rected by  the Army Research and Development Command's Picatinny  Arsenal. The  prime  contractor for  TOW  improvement is  Hughes Aircraft Company, and  the  primary subcontractor is Texas Instruments, Incorporated.

The Army initiated two  major product improvement pro› grams  (PIPs)  to  upgrade the  nonnuclear and  nuclear warheads for  the  Lance  missile.  The nonnuclear PIP  is an  exchange of  the old  submunition for a  much improved one, while  the nuclear PIP  upgrades the technology of  the warhead. Both improve› ments  should be  completed by  the  end  of  fiscal  year 1983.

Approximately ten years of  Dragon missile production at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, ended in  November 1981.  Before production was  phased out, it  was  determined that the  Dragon

met  the  criteria for  the  layaway  mobilization program and  plant equipment package assignment. All  Dragon equipment was  re› moved  from  the  Redstone Arsenal assembly  site  and  placed  in  a holding area. The Raytheon Company received a  layaway  con› tract  in  May  1982.

A relook  study  on  the  Infantry Manportable Assault  Weapon System  (IMAA WS),  completed in  April 1981,  proved inconclu› sive and  led  to a delay  in  starting development with  the  realloca› tion of  funds to other high-priority programs. A  subsequent TRADOC  study  defined the  infantry antiarmor requirements of a  more comprehensive review  entitled the  Close  Combat Light Mission  Area  Analysis  (CCLMAA).  The  larger  study,  which  was completed in March 1982,  addressed light infantry scenarios and, through war-gaming and analysis, clearly supported the need  for  Rattler-the new  name  given  to  IMAA WS in  Novem› ber  1981-in dismounted infantry units.  InJune 1982 the  Army leadership approved an  RDTE  program for  Rattler missiles  and launchers for light forces. On 1  September 1982  the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations and  Plans  formed a Rattler work› ing  group to  expedite planning and  to  respond to  concerns on the  need, affordability, and  technology of  Rattler.

During  fiscal year  1982,  the  third year  of  Patriot production, a contract  was awarded for  9 fire  units  and 176 missiles,  bringing the  total  to  19 fire  units  and  423  missiles  under contract out  of  a program goal  of  103 fire  units  and  6,217  missiles.  The first  pro› duction missiles  and  fire  units  from the  fiscal  year  1980  contract were  accepted by  the government and delivered to  Fort Bliss, Texas,  and  White  Sands  Missile  Range, New  Mexico,  for  train› ing  and  integration testing. The first Patriot battalion was  acti› vated  at  Fort  Bliss, and  all initial  training of  instructors and  key personnel was completed in preparation for  the  battalion to reach its operational capability in  the  continental United States  by  the spring of  1983.

The  third  of  four  series  of confirmation tests  was completed, as directed by  the  Defense Systems  Acquisition Review  Council to  demonstrate that problems with Patriot software maturity, electronic countermeasures, and  reliability had  been  corrected. The  results  were  reviewed  by OSD,  and  authorization was given for  the  Army  to  proceed with  the  fourth, and  last,  series  of  tests. Additionally, OSD  delegated responsibility fr the Patriot pro› gram's  management review  to  the  Army.

The  United States  continued to support a NATO  acquisition study  effort for  Patriot. Germany, the  Netherlands, and  Greece have  indicated an  interest in  pursuing bilateral programs with

the  United States. The Netherlands and Greece submitted re› quests  for  price and  availability, and  discussions with  Germany are  under way.  Under a  foreign Military  Sales  case,  the  govern› ment  of Japan began  a study  of Patriot  as a replacement for  their Nike  Hercules and  basic  Hawk  systems.  The  study  is scheduled for  completion in January 1983.

Following a  decision to  extend the  life  of  the Hawk  missile indefinitely, the  Army  formed an  evolution task  force to  study technologies, concepts, and improvements for the support of U.S.  air  defense through the year 2000. In  a  related develop› ment  the  U.S.  Army  Missile  Command prepared a  study  on  the evolution of  the Hawk  missile.  The report particularly empha› sized  changes that would  reduce manpower requirements, im› prove  strategic  transportability, and  increase  firepower. The  study would  serve  as  the basis  for future (phase IV)  Hawk product improvement programs. During the past year, the Army has continued to  concentrate on  improving Hawk  readiness, produc› ing  hardware for  phase II  improvements, and  refining require› ments and design concepts for phase III. Fielding of  phase I advancements was  completed, and deliveries of  phase II soft› ware  were  made.

Deliveries of  Stinger missiles  were  delayed during the  year because  of  problems with  grips tock  fabrication and  the  rejection of Lot  8 for  two "eject only"  malfunctions. An engineering change proposed by the  contractor and  approved by the  Army  resolved the  gripstock problem, and Lot  8  was  requalified. As  a  result, there were  only  short delays  in  Stinger deployment, which  was continued to  USAREUR and  which  was  begun to  the  82d  Air› borne Division. USAREUR units fired forty basic  Stinger mis› siles  during the first annual European service practice held at NAMFI Range on Crete. The gunners recorded thirty-seven successful  firings  during this  training exercise  for  new equipment. The  ten-round Stinger-Post contractor flight  test  program ended in  May  1982. Negotiations with  Germany continued on  the  memo of  understanding for  NATO coproduction of  the  Stinger. FMS sales of  the  Stinger to  the  Netherlands and  Japan got  under way during fiscal  year 1982.

Because  of  budgetary constraints, the  Army  halted produc› tion of  the Roland air defense missile  after procuring 27  fire units  and 595  missiles.  Also,  the  fire  unit will be  mounted on  a wheeled  vehicle  (M812  derivative) rather than  a tracked vehicle. The New  Mexico  Army  National Guard's 5th  Battalion, 200th Air  Defense  Artillery, will be  the  only  unit  in  the  Army  equipped with  the  Roland.

The  division  air  defense (DIVAD)  gun  continued under re› search  and  development through fiscal year  1982.  A two-month test  begun in January 1982  verified that the  system  performed satisfactorily. The  Defense Systems  Acquisition Review  Council met  on  4 - May  1982  and recommended that the  DIV AD  gun, which  was  renamed the  Sgt.  York  division  air  defense gun,  go into  production. The  recommendation was approved, and  Ford Aerospace  and  Communications Corporation received  an  initial production contract for fifty  units. Following  the  award of  the contract, several  measures were  taken  to ensure that  units  deliv› ered  to  the  Army  satisfied requirements completely. Durability and  mobility  testing  was conducted at Aberdeen Proving  Ground. The  contractor facility  worked on  integrated logistical  support, software  maturation, and  built-in test  capabilities.

## Ground  Combat Systems

The  M 1 Abrams  tank  went  into  full-scale  production in fiscal year  1982, and  by the  end  of  September a total  of  612  tanks  had been  accepted. Fielding  the  M  1 tank  to Europe began  in January 1982,  and  by  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  four Ml  Abrams  tank battalion sets  had  been issued  within USAREUR.  Three of  the Abrams-equipped battalions have  completed all maintenance and crew transition training at  the  Vilseck-Grafenwoehr training area. The  fourth  battalion  will complete  its training  in  November 1982. The three M 1 battalions that had finished transition training participated in the  REFORGER xercise  of  13-24  September e 1982. The  performance of  the  vehicles  and  units  was superb. Training and  fielding at  FORSCOM was  begun in  August 1982.  Three companies  of the  2d  Battalion, 5th  Cavalry,  1st Cavalry  Division, at  Fort Hood, Texas, have  their tanks; the  fourth company is expected to  have  tanks  in  October 1982.  Maintenance training was completed, and the  battalion was  well  into  crew  transition training.

Work  continued during the  year  ·to  correct two  of  the  thir› teen  requirements for  reliability,  maintainability, availability, and durability that had not been met  during DT-OT III testing. These  deficiencies involved  track  life and  power  train  durability. It had  been  determined that  track  life was limited  by state -of-the art  rubber technology, but  investigations were  under way to ex› tend track life. To  correct the power train durability perfor› mance  which  was 4 percent  short  of the  requirement, a follow-up durability test  was instituted to validate  corrections made  during production and  to raise  power  train  durability  to acceptable  levels.

First production delivery of  the 120-mm. tank gun, which will  replace the 105-mm. gun as  the main armament of  the Abrams  tank,  slipped from  August 1984 to the  fourth quarter of fiscal  year 1985  because of problems with the U .S.-produced 120-mm.  ammunition. The cartridge cases  posed special  prob› lems  with  regard to  field serviceability and survivability if  the ammunition compartments were penetrated. Tests for special shock and  isolating  techniques were  under way at Aberdeen Prov› ing  Ground to  resolve the  problems.

Production of  the M60A3  tank  in  fiscal  year 1982  reached 342 vehicles,  of which 122 were  for  the  U.S.  Army  and  222  were for  foreign customers. Of  the  U.S.  Army's new  production re› quirement of  1,666  M60A3s,  a total  of  1,542  had  been  produced by the  end  of  the  year.

Significant progress was  made  during the  year  in  converting the M60Al tanks in the Army's inventory to  the M60A3  tank thermal-sight configuration-made in  light  of  the  Vice  Chief  of Staffs decision of  October 1981  to  have  a  two-tank fleet (MI s and M60A3s)  by  the 1990s.  Anniston Army  Depot made 286 conversions, and  the  Mainz  Army  Depot  accomplished 161. Con› siderable cost savings, realized through a fiscal year 1982 multiyear contract on  fire  control solid-state computers and  laser range-finders, were applied to the conversion program, thus enabling the  M60  tank  program manager to  fund extra quanti› ties of  Al to A3 conversion kits and  increase the  annual out-year conversion rate from 360  to  460.  This will allow  Mainz  to  com› plete  its part of  the  conversion program by fiscal  year 1990,  and Anniston by  fiscal  year 1994.

During fiscal year 1982, deployments of M60A3s to USAREUR  continued from  both  Anniston and  Mainz.  CONUS deployments began  this  year,  with  the  first  increment of  M60A3 tanks converted at Anniston being fielded to  elements of  the 24th  Infantry Division  at  Fort  Stewart, Georgia. Furthermore, in July 1982,  a  historic first was  realized when eighteen M60A3 tanks  were  issued  to  the  48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of the  Georgia National Guard. This  event  marked the  first  time  in history  that  a National Guard  unit  received  a new weapon  system before active  Army  units  did.

Work  continued in  fiscal  year 1982  on  M60-series tank  prod› uct  improvements, which  were  being  developed on  the  basis  of two objectives.  The  primary objective  was to advance  tank  perfor› mance  in  the  areas  of  firepower, mobility,  reliability, availability, maintainability, and  deployment. The  secondary goal  was to  en› sure  commonality, or  interoperability, with  the  MI  Abrams tank

in  order to  standardize logistic support and increase training efficiency .  Design of  adaption hardware for the MS  chemical alarm  was finalized, testing of  hardware developed in  the  Clean Air  Program was initiated, and  development of an  automatic fire suppression system  continued.

On  their  own  initiative, some  contractors developed plans  to upgrade the  M60  tank  beyond the  M60A3  tank's  thermal-sight configuration. In  the fall  of 1981,  the  M60  program manager performed an  in-depth study  of  several  upgrade alternatives for the  M60A3  tank. Primary areas under consideration were  im› proved lethality, survivability, and  fire  control. Several  options were  addressed in  each area. Also,  the U.S.  Marine Corps re› viewed  alternative concepts to  upgrade its  M60Al tank  fleet.

The  FMC  Corporation received a  fiscal  year 1982  procure› ment  contract for  600  Bradley fighting vehicles.  Delivery  of  143 vehicles  during the  year represented the full  purchase of 100 vehicles  made  in fiscal year  1980 as well as 43 of  the  400  vehicles bought  under fiscal  year 1981 authorizations. The  vehicles  were furnished to  service  schools  and  to  DARCOM for  development of  logistics  support and  training . The Bradley fighting vehicles completed first  article  testing  in  August 1982.  Meanwhile, initial production testing  of seven  vehicles  had  begun  at Aberdeen Prov› ing  Ground in June 1982 and  was expected to continue until  the following  January .  In addition to  the  vehicle  program, the  25mm.  gun  and  the  5.56  firing port weapon were  in  production .

The  overhaul and  modification of  M 113A 1 armored person› nel  carriers of  the  Eighth Army  and  Western Command, in  or› der to  bring them to Ml  13A2  status (improved cooling and suspension), was being  accomplished at  the  rate  of  fourteen per month at  the DAEWOO  Industries plant, Chang Won,  Korea. The  limited  buying  of  180 new  Ml  13A2 carriers forced deliver› ies under contract to  be  stretched out  in  order to  keep  produc› tion  lines  open  until  fiscal year  1983  purchases were  made.  FMC Corporation invested its  own  resources and  began  building ap› proximately five  hundred Ml  13A2  carriers in  anticipation of foreign sales.

The  Improved TOW  Vehicle  (ITV)  is an  Ml  l 3A2  armored personnel  carrier modified  by the  addition of a two-tube  launcher head, mounted on  a  hydraulically driven cupola with  a  360degree traverse capability. It  provides armor protection for  the crew and  TOW  systems  components against  small  arms  and  indi› rect  artillery fire. Fielding of  the ITV  to  active  Army and se› lected  Army  National Guard units continued throughout fiscal year  1982.  A  production contract for  the  kits  needed to  modify

the  ITV  for  firing the  TOW 2  missile  was  awarded in January 1982. Deliveries  are  scheduled to commence in  November 1982, with  initial installation on  TRADOC training base  vehicles in January 1983  and  full  implementation of  the  retrofit program scheduled to  start with  the  upgrading of  TOW system  equip› ment  beginning in July 1983.

While  modernization of the  howitzer  system  remained a rela› tively  low  priority during fiscal  year 1982,  some  improvements were  made. In  the area of  towed artillery, 204  Ml98 155-mm. howitzers  were  procured for  units  of  the  Army  National Guard and  Army  Reserve. With  regard to  self-propelled artillery, the Army  neared completion of  an  investigation of  possible  improve› ment  of the  M 109  155-mm.  howitzer  that  would  maintain it as an effective system  through the 1990s.  And although upgrading the  M 109 was pref erred, the  Army  also considered developing a new  system  or  adapting a  foreign system  to  meet U.S.  defense needs.  Additionally, the  Army  was moving  forward  with the  How› itzer Extended Life Program (HELP).  Prototype  HELP  kits, which are  designed to improve reliability, maintainability, survivability, and  NBC  protection, should  be  ready  for  testing  in  the  next  two years.

The field artillery ammunition support vehicle (FAASV)  is an armored ammunition carrier built  on  a modified M 109 chassis. It  presently incorporates a  crane for  loading ammunition onto the  vehicle,  an X-.Y stacker for  moving ammunition inside the vehicle, and  a conveyor  for  moving  ammunition from  the  F  AASV into  the  howitzer. The  conveyor  can  also be used  to move  ammu› nition into the vehicle. Development testing was  begun on 16 November 1981  and was  completed on  21  April 1982.  Opera› tionaJ  testing  started on  11 January 1982 and  ended on  21 April 1982. The  development acceptance in-process review,  at which  a decision  will be  made on  the  F  AASV  type  classification, will be held  in  December 1982.  Contract award  for  initial  production is planned for  February 1983.

In  response to  a  solicitation to  thirty-nine firms  on  29 June 1981 requesting offers on  a  proposed five-year procurement of a  standardized 9-mm. personal defense weapon (PDW),  four acceptable proposals and  weapons samples  were  received from Beretta USA  Corporation; Smith  and  Wesson, Inc.; Maremont Corporation; and  Heckler and  Koch,  Inc.  The  sample  handguns were  subjected to  extensive tests  to  demonstrate the  characteris› tics of  each  weapon in  relation to  the  requirements set  forth in the  solicitation. The  results  of this  thorough evaluation and  anal› ysis showed  that  no  samples met  all  essential requirements. Pri-

mary  areas  of  failure were  reliability and  operation under ad› verse conditions (low  temperature, mud, and sand). On 19 February 1982,  the  Army  canceled the  solicitation.

On  30 June 1982,  the  Deputy Secretary of  Defense directed the  Army,  as  lead  service,  to  revise  the  joint service  operational requirement, acquisition plan,  and  test  plan  for  the  9-mm. PDW. A  contract award date was  set  for the fourth quarter of  fiscal year  1983 in order to  meet  an  urgent Coast  Guard requirement and  to  comply with  the  request of  the  chairman of  the House Appropriations Committee for  an  expedited procurement pro› cess.  Progress in  carrying out  this  instruction was  brought to  a halt by  language in the fiscal  year 1983  Authorized Bill  and Conference Report prohibiting the  Army  from  obligating or  ex› pending fiscal year  1983 funds  for  the  evaluation or  purchase of 9-mm.  handguns. The  bill  further advised that this  prohibition did  not  preclude the  Army  from purchasing 9-mm . handguns for  the  Department of Transportation law enforcement function.

## Aviation

Following  presentations to the  Army  Systems  Acquisition Re› view  Council (ASARC  III) on  9  November 1981,  the AH-64 Apache  advanced  attack  helicopter  was type  classified  as standard. The  Defense Systems  Acquisition Review  Council (DSARC  III) met  on  26 March 1982 and  approved production of the  AH-64; the Secretary of  Defense confirmed the decision on 15  April 1982. Production contracts  were  signed  with  Hughes Helicopters, General Electric,  and Martin Marietta; deliveries were  expected in  1984.

Throughout the  year,  tests  conducted on  various  components of  the  AH-64 proved successful. Flight  testing of  the  Apache's target acquisition designation system  (TADS)  at  Yuma  Proving Ground was also  accomplished. This  covered verification of  day and  night  detection and  recognition ranges, forward-looking in› frared direct view  optics  and day  television designations, auto› matic  and manual tracking performance, and automatic bore sight  verifications. The 500-hour endurance test  of  TADS  and the  pilots  night vision  sensor (PNVS)  ended successfully on  12 December 1981. T ADS-NVS  tower  testing  began  on  1  June 1982 and  was not  concluded by  the  close  of  fiscal  year 1982.

A reassessment of  the  Cobra program, entitled Cobra  2000, led to the termination of  engineering development for the forward-looking infrared augmented Cobra  TOW  sight (FACTS); in addition, improvements for  the  AH lS  Cobra/TOW were  lim-

ited  to night  capability,  a four-blade rotor system,  and  a mechani› cal  environmental control unit, among others. The limitations were  imposed by a series  of  general officer reviews  by the  Army staff,  which  acted  upon a list of  improvements recommended by TRADOC. The four-blade rotor system  was  later determined not  to  be  affordable, and development was  stopped. Work  on other advancements continued. During fiscal  year 1982, 129 AH-1  Gs were  converted to AH-1  S fully modernized Cobras,  and five  new  production AH-lSs were  received for the  Army Na› tional  Guard. Fielding of  the  fully  modernized Cobra  was com› pleted in  Korea and  continued in  Europe.

Full-scale development of  the Scout helicopter under the Army  helicopter improvement program (AHIP) began 1 Novem› ber 1981,  following successful negotiations with  Bell  Helicopter Textron over  production option ceiling  prices for  sixty  aircraft for  fiscal years  1984  and 1985.  Preliminary design  review  for  the AHIP Scout  was  completed in  March 1982,  after milestone II reviews  by  ASARC  and  DSARC.  The  design phase of  the pro› gram  was essentially  done  by the  end  of  the  fiscal year,  by which time Bell Helicopter Textron had finished modifying five OH-58A airframes to  the AHIP Scout  configuration. Limited engineering support testing on  "brassboard" hardware was con› ducted to  demonstrate the  feasibility  of  the  selected AHIP  Scout design  concepts.

In December 1981  the Secretary of  Defense approved the establishment of  the  joint advanced vertical lift aircraft (JVX) program, with  the  Army  as lead  service.  A joint technical assess› ment  group  met  on  4 February 1982 to examine  existing  technol› ogy  that  might  be  applicable in  developing the JVX. The  group evaluated the  high-speed conventional helicopter, the  compound helicopter, the  tilt  rotor concept, and  the  lift-cruise fan  concept. It  concluded that requirements could be  met  with  a  common airframe. The  joint technical assessment group worked in  con› junction with  the  joint service  operational requirements group, which  had  its  first  meeting on  8  February 1982.  Its  task  was  to document and  provide a detailed definition of  requirements for a  common aircraft. The service secretaries signed a  memoran› dum  of understanding on  4 June 1982 which  set program objec› tives for  the JVX. An implementing memorandum of agreement was being  staffed as  the  fiscal  year  ended.

A  multiyear (fiscal  years 1982-1984) procurement contract for  194 UH-60A Black  Hawks  was awarded to  Sikorsky  Aircraft on 12  April 1982.  The $950-million contract saved the Army $81.1  million  over  the  three-year period. The  Army  awarded a

triservice  multiyear contract for  fiscal years  1982-1983  to General Electric  for  T700-GE-700 engines to  support procurement of Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force  Black  Hawk  aircraft and  the  Army's Apache  helicopter for  fiscal years  1982-1984. In  May  1982 three Hellfire missiles  were successfully fired from the Black  Hawk during tests at Redstone Arsenal as  part of  a  congressionally mandated feasibility demonstration. Later the ESSS  (External Stores Support System) contract was  modified to require the developer to  perform, among  other  things,  justification tests  for increasing the Black  Hawk's maximum operating gross  weight from  20,250  pounds to  22,000 pounds.

The  CH-47 modernization program continued on  schedule as  it  entered its  second year  of  production. Following the  con› tract award to  Boeing Vertol in  December 1981,  nineteen air› craft were received at the factory for modernization into the much-improved CH-4  7D configuration. The  first  production de› livery was  on 20  May 1982, eleven days ahead of contract schedule. The  aircraft was sent  to  the  Patuxent River  Naval  Air Test  Center in  Maryland for  electromagnetic capability testing. The  second  production aircraft was  delivered on  16 July 1982, one  and  a  half  months ahead of  schedule. This  aircraft under› went  400  hours  of first  article  production testing  at  Fort  Rucker, Alabama.  Negotiations were  under way at the  end  of the  year  for the  third-year production contract and  for  potential three-year procurement (fiscal  years 1983-1985). This  multiyear procure› ment  was  not  approved by  the  Congress.

## International Cooperation

Since fiscal year  1979,  Belgium, France,  the  Federal Republic of  Germany, the  Netherlands, Norway,  and  the  United States› all members of  the  NATO Army  Armaments Group (NAAG)› have  been involved in  negotiations which  led  to  the approval of  a  memorandum of  understanding dealing with  the  compara› tive testing  and  evaluation of anti-infrared smoke  for  the  protec› tion  of  combat vehicles. The six  NATO countries successfully completed the  summer phase  of  the  tests  at  Bourges, France, in September 1982.  Eight  smokes  were  evaluated.

In  another N AAG  activity,  the  United States  hosted for  the first  time  the  biannual meeting of  NAAG's  Panel  X Interservice Group  on  Six Vehicles  for  Tactical  Air  Mobility.  The  discussions, which  were  held  at  the  Naval  Postgraduate School  in  Monterey, California, focused on  Soviet  bloc  capabilities, icing  problems, and  antiarmor helicopter systems. Fiscal  year 1982  activities  of

the  Antitank Guided Weapons (ATGW)  Working Group, com› posed  of  France, the  Federal Republic of  Germany, the  United Kingdom, and  the  United States, focused on  codevelopment of the  next  generation of ATGWs:  the  United  States  worked  on  the next  man portable replacement, the  Europeans on  a new vehicle› mounted weapon. Although the  memorandum of  understand› ing  authorizing cooperation in  this  area  expired in  March 1982, the working group met in  June to  discuss Rattler, formerly IMAAWS  (Infantry Manportable Assault Weapon System); a completed feasibility study; and  plans  for  the  next  phase  of  sys› tem  development. At  the  September meeting of  the  Senior Na› tional  Representatives held  in Bonn,  the  ATGW  Working Group advised that there was  no  basis  on  which a  program package could  be  recommended at  that time.

Language in  the  fiscal  year 1982 Department of  Defense  Ap› propriation Bill left  out  the  previous exception to  the  restriction on purchases of foreign-produced specialty metals-nickel, cobalt-base alloys, zirconium, zirconium-base alloys, titanium, and  titanium-base alloys-given to  buys  that furthered NA TO rationalization, standardization, and  interoperability or  that  were made  in compliance  with  offset  agreements. This  omission  threat› ened  the  purchase of  the  improved 81-mm.  mortar from  Great Britain, the  squad  automatic weapon (SAW) from  Belgium,  and the  Maschinenfabrik Au gs  berg  N  uernberg (MAN) truck  from  the Federal Republic of  Germany. Relief  came  with  the  passage of the Department of Defense Authorization Act  for fiscal  year 1983,  Title XI  of  which  restored the  exemption.

Over  the  years, the  Department of  Defense has  lent  equip› ment  to  allied  and  other friendly countries for  tests  and  evalua› tion  under the  heading of  international research, development, and  standardization. The Department of  Defense also  borrows equipment for  the  same  purpose. Before  31 December 1981,  the Army  had  authority to  approve equipment loans . On  that  date, Congress  amended the  Arms  Export Control Act of  1968 so that now  the United States must lease  equipment rather than loan it,  under agreements such  as  the  American, British, Canadian, Australian (ABCA) Program, the North Atlantic Treaty Or› ganization memoranda of understanding, and data exchange agreements. On 28 May  1982,  an  executive order delegated leas› ing  authority to  the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense. Leases for  the  purpose of  cooperative research and  development, elec› tronic  interface projects, and  military  exercises  or  for  equipment past  three-quarters of  service  life  may  be  made at  no  cost  to  the lessor-tantamount to  a loan.  However, many  requests for  equip-

ment  do  not  satisfy  these  criteria and  require certain rental pay› ments  although  they support standardization and  interoperability. The  International Office, ODCSRDA,  has  taken  action  to  seek legislative  relief  allowing  the  loan  or  no-cost  lease  of materiel for standardization and  interoperability purposes.

## Procurement

The  obligation  plan  of the  Army  procurement appropriation for  fiscal year  1982 amounted to $14.644  billion:  $12.622  billion for  direct Army  procurement, and  $2.022  billion  for  reimburs› able  customer sales.  The plan covered all  obligations in  fiscal year  1982  from  funds appropriated for  fiscal  years 1980-1982. Actual  obligations incurred during the  year  exceeded the  plan by  $131  million  ($139  million  over  the  plan  in  direct procure› ment  and  $8  million  under in  reimbursable sales).  Total  obliga› tions  of$14.775 billion  were  made  up  of $12.760  billion  in direct Army  procurement and  $2.015  billion  in reimbursable customer sales.  The lapse of  funding for the expiring fiscal  year 1980 program came  to  $189.3  million.

The  Army  procurement portion of  the  budget request for fiscal  year 1983  amounted to  $17 .829  billion-$3.2 billion  over the  fiscal  year 1982  appropriation. This  increase would  permit higher production for several weapon systems, including the Black  Hawk  utility helicopter, the advanced attack helicopter (AAH),  the  multiple  launch  rocket  system  (MLRS), the  Sgt. York division  air  defense (DIVAD)  gun  system,  Pershing II, Patriot air defense missile  system, and the precision guided and im› proved nuclear-conventional missile systems. Requests to  the weapons and tracked combat vehicles (WTCV)  appropriation included  initiatives  to improve  combat  power,  particularly in  sup› port of NATO. Funding requests for the procurement of ammunition included substantial increases in  the laser-guided Copperhead round and  the  initial  procurement of binary  chemi› cal round components. The  funding request for  items  under the "other procurement" appropriation included $2.339  billion  for communications and electronic equipment, $1.256 billion for tactical  and  support vehicles,  and  $971.8  million  for  other sup› port  equipment. Final  congressional action  on  the  Army  procure› ment  appropriation for  fiscal year  1983 had  not  been  completed by the  close  of  the  reporting period (30  September 1982).

## Construction,  Facilities,  Real  Property, and  Physical Security

An army  must  perform a whole  series  of mundane but  neces› sary  activities  far  removed from  the  realities  of  the  battlefield. It must, for example, take on  the roles of  real estate broker, landlord, and  policeman: to  buy  land for  training and  housing troops  and  sell it when  no  longer needed; to  build  structures in which  to  house troops and to  develop, test, repair, and store equipment; to  maintain the  land  and  the  structures; and  to  pro› tect  these assets  from vandalism and the people who  live  and work  there from crime. In 1982,  the  Army  found much  to  be optimistic about  concerning its  performance of  these  missions.

## Construction

In  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  requested $1,079,700,000 and received a  total obligational authority of  $943,701,000 from Congress.  During  the  year  the  Department of  Defense  construc› tion  fund transferred some  $7  million  to  the  Army, increasing the  obligation  authority to approximately $951  million.  Based  on this figure, the Military Construction Directorate of  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) predicted an  award of $826,071,000 under the 1982  Military Construction, Army, program. The field operating agencies of  the Corps of  Engi› neers made  an  exceptional effort and obligated $823,041,000 before the  end  of  the  fiscal  year. Congress allocated the  $951million  appropriation among  various  needs.  The  largest  portion, $328 million, was  invested in troop housing and medical, community, and  related facilities,  including an  $18-million bar› racks  in Korea; barracks modernization worth $19  million at Fort  Dix,  New  Jersey; an  $81-million hospital at  Fort Carson, Colorado; a  $7-million physical fitness center at Fort Lewis, Washington; and alterations to  an  administrative and support facility  at  Walter Reed  Army  Medical  Center, Washington, D.C. Operations and  training received $75  million  from  the  Military Construction, Army, budget. Major projects included a  $12million  tank  crew  qualification range  at  Grafenwoehr, Germany, and construction of  battalion headquarters and classrooms at

Fort  Drum,  New York;  Fort  Hood,  Texas;  Fort  Irwin,  California; and  Fort  Stewart,  Georgia.  Congress  authorized $157  million  for maintenance and  production facilities  to  equip the  field  forces. It provided $103  million to  facilities for supply, research and development, administration, and  utilities.  Some  $61  million  went for  conserving energy, $5 million  for  combating water  pollution, and  $7 million  for  cleaning the  air.  Congress gave  the  Army  $28 million  to acquire  land  at  Fort  Carson  and  $11  million  to correct Occupational Safety  and Health Act  deficiencies .  It appropri› ated  $128  million  for  general authorization planning and  design and  $12  million  for  management services  in support of construc› tion  projects funded by  foreign nations where  U.S. forces  were the  sole or  primary user. It allocated  $10  million  for  access roads. The 1982  appropriation provided $26  million in  new  obliga› tional  authority for  exigent  minor  construction projects  and  $6.  78 million  for  specified minor  construction projects. Exigent  minor construction projects are  those  costing $1  million  or  less which may demand the  immediate attention of  the  Corps  of  Engineers and  which  are  not  specifically  authorized by Congress. Instead it appropriates a lump  sum.  Specified  minor  construction projects are  those  costing $1  million  or  less  which  Congress specifically authorizes. By the  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  had  placed more  money  in  minor construction projects than ever  before, $32.2  million.

In  view  of  significant backlogs  in  military construction and the tightening of  budgetary constraints, the Army  placed in› creased emphasis on the more efficient use of installations. Accordingly, the  Office  of  the  Assistant Chief  of  Engineers initi› ated  a review  of  Military  Construction, Army,  projects  contained in  the installation's five-year defense plan, using the recently developed Directed Stationing System  (DSS). DSS is a computer progr am which provides  a bre akdown,  by building  category  codes, of  information on  the  ability  of  an  installation to  house a  given force  as  well  as  what  housing the  force requires. DSS indicates surpluses and shortages in  the unit under consideration and estimates  the  expense of  expanding facilities  to  house the  force properly. DSS obtains  data  on current assets of the  facilities  from reports given  by  the  installation in  th e  Integrated Facilities  Sys› tem  and  the  Real Prop erty  Inventory. For  comparison purposes, DSS generates data  on  facilities  requirements based on  the  force structure and  equipment information drawn  from  the  Personnel and  Logistics  Structure and  Composition Systems  which  is incor› porated into  the  Army  Stationing and  Ins tallation Plan.

The  Production Base  Support (PBS)  program provides the construction necessary to  develop, maintain, and  retain an  effi-

cient  industrial base.  Although the  funding for  construction of industrial facilities  came  from  five  procurement appropriations, the  Army  concentrated most  of its current work  on  the  ammuni› tion  and  tank  programs. During 1982,  these  programs received $64  million  and  $38  million,  respectively, of  the  $102  million  in the Production Base  Support program. Design continued on projects valued at  about $355  million.

In  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Corps  of  Engineers started ten Mili› tary  Construction, Army,  medical  projects, of which  five were in Europe, one  in  the  Pacific,  and four in  the  continental United States . At  the  same  time,  the  Corps completed fifteen projects, the  largest of  which  was  the  Col.  Florence A.  Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at  Fort  Campbell, Kentucky.  The  first  hos› pital  named for  an  Army  nurse, the  Blanchfield Army  Commu› nity Hospital contained the most modern medical equipment available. It  was,  observed a  representative from the  Office  of The  Surgeon General, "state  of  the  art." The  Mobile  District  of the  Corps  of  Engineers started the  project design  in  April 197  4 and  completed it  in June 1977.  The district office  awarded the construction project to  a contractor in  August 1977.  The  hospi› tal  followed  a  new  design concept that  would  allow  it to  survive earthquakes intact.  The  building consisted  of three  asymmetrical blocks:  one  containing beds,  another housing administrative of› fices and  diagnostic facilities,  and  the  third having  the  outpatient clinics. Each  block  had  a different structural system.  The  contrac› tor completed construction in  July 1982.  Brig.  Gen. Hazel  W. Johnson, the Chief of  the Army  Nurse Corps, officially dedi› cated  the  hospital on  17 September 1982.

At  the  end of  fiscal  year 1982,  the  Corps of  Engineers had twenty-one medical projects under construction. The eleven hospitals,  four  dental clinics,  one  health clinic,  and  five combina› tion  health and  dental clinics  had  a  total  value  of  $379  million. By 30 September 1982  Congress had  reviewed, authorized, and appropriated the  fiscal  year  1983  Medical  Military  Construction, Army,  program as submitted and  had  added a $1,050,000 health clinic to be  constructed at Fort Benning, Georgia. The re› maining projects approved included hospital alterations at Bremerhaven, Germany, for $29  million; at  Gorgas, Panama, for  $2.65  million; and  at  Fort Leavenworth, Kansas,  for  $13.6 million.  Also approved were  construction of troop  clinics at Camp Casey,  Korea, for  $3.8  million  and  at  Fort Ord, California, for $5.8  million  and a  project to  upgrade the  heating, ventilating, and  air  conditioning (HV AC)  system  at  the  Armed Forces  Insti› tute  of  Pathology, Walter Reed  Army  Medical  Center, for  $9.8

million.  The  Surgeon General's five-year  program for  moderniz› ing  health facilities provided for the following funding: $31.5 million  in  fiscal  year 1984,  $323.0 million in  fiscal  year 1985, $332.1  million  in  fiscal  year 1986,  $299.4  million  in  fiscal  year 1987, and  $232.3  million  in  fiscal year  1988.  The  huge  increase beginning in  1985 came  from  the  simultaneous programming of three major  Army  medical  construction projects, a  situation re› sulting  from  budget cuts  and  project delays.  The  Office  of  The Surgeon  General  found  that  anticipated budget  cuts  made  imple› mentation of  the  total  program questionable at  best.

The  Military  Construction, Army  Reserve  (MCAR),  program provides for  the  design and  construction of  various facilities  to support the  Army  Reserve's  training requirement and  mobiliza› tion mission. Typical facilities include Army  Reserve trainig centers, organizational maintenance shops, equipment concen› tration  sites, weekend  training  areas,  and  annual  training  facilities. During fiscal  year 1982  the  Corps of  Engineers awarded con› struction contracts for  thirty-two MCAR  projects  worth  at  $52.7 million. Contractors finished work on  projects costing $11.2 million.

The  Corps share of  the  fiscal  year 1982  Air  Force  military construction program amounted to  $699.2 million. The Corps had  forecast  $622  million  for  award,  but  actually  let $635  million. The  Corps  awarded contracts for  93  percent of  the  projects in the  1982 Military  Construction, Air  Force,  program for  which  it had responsibility, thus exceeding the goal  established by  the Office  of  the  Secretary of  Defense. The  unawarded part of  the program comprised projects affected by late  design  and  criteria changes.  Design  continued on  an  Air  Force  fiscal year  1983 pro› gram  that  totaled  $1,282  million  and  a fiscal year  1984  program in  excess  of  $1,676 million. The lack  of  an  approved basing mode  in  1982  delayed support by the  Corps  for  the  Air  Force's MX missile.  On  1 October 1981  President Ronald Reagan  can› celed  the  horizontal protective shelter system  in  favor  of  study› ing  several  other options. The  Corps  of Engineers MX Program Agency (CEMXPA), located  with the Air Force  program manager, redirected its  efforts in  order to  support research and  develop› ment  efforts  of the  Air  Force.  The  Corps  expected a decision  on a  new  basing  mode  early  in  fiscal  year 1983.

The  Corps  also  let  contracts for  the  construction of  projects funded by  other Department of  Defense agencies. The total amount of  construction awards for each agency during fiscal year  1982  was as  follows:

Defense  Logistics  Agency

............

....

$10,237,000

Defense  Mapping Agency

.................

2,263,000

Defense  Dependents School  System

........

39,460,000

National Security  Agency

.................

55,100,000

Defense  Communications Agency

............

565,000

Other Department of  Defense agencies

.... $27,264,000

In  keeping with  the  expanded U.  S. presence in  the  Indian Ocean  and  Persian Gulf, the  Department of  Defense assigned the  responsibility  of construction agent  for  the  bases of  the  Rapid Deployment Joint Task  Force  (RDJTF) in  Egypt  and  Oman to the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of Engineers. During 1982, the  Rear  Eche› lon Office of the Corps Middle East Division at Berryville, Virginia, continued to plan and design a  base at Ras  Banas, Egypt.  In  Oman  the  Middle  East  Division  awarded two construc› tion contracts to  improve air base  facilities at Masirah Island and  Seeb.  Construction continued at  the  Thumrait and  Khasab air bases. The Middle East  Division also  designed additional facilities for the two  bases  to  be  included in  the budgets for fiscal  years 1983,  1984,  and 1985.

Other  overseas  construction subject  to oversight  by the  Corps of  Engineers, excluding the  work  discussed  in  the  security  assis› tance section of  Chapter 8,  included projects in  Saudi Arabia and the Soviet  Union. During 1982,  the Corps cont inued to design  and  construct the  $56.9  million U.S.  Geological  Service Mission  in  Saudi  Arabia. Four  Corps  construction management engineers continued to assist the  Department of State  in building the  new  U.S. Embassy  complex  in  Moscow.

During fiscal  year 1982,  Congress provided $5.9  million  in Military  Construction, Army,  funds for  the  Corps  of  Engineers to  support construction in Japan and  Korea  paid  for  by the  host nations.  The  governments of Japan and  Korea  designed,  funded, and  awarded contracts and  oversaw  the  construction of facilities for  U.S.  forces,  which  supplement those  funded and  built  by the U.S.  government. The  Corps  participated in  preparing the  cri› teria and overseeing the design and construction of  facilities funded by the  host  nation.  Japan budgeted $226  million  for  the program in  fiscal  year 1982;  Korea  provided $144  million.

The  U. S. Army  Construction Engineering Research  Labora› tory  (CERL)  at  Champaign, Illinois, is  the newest  of  the  four Corps  of Engineers laboratories. Established in  1968, it is located on  a  thirty-acre site  at the Interstate Research Park, where it takes  advantage of  the  resources and  facilities  of  the  University of  Illinois  and  other Midwestern universities. During  an  average

year,  one  hundred graduate students perform research on  the site as part  of their  academic  program. The  CERL  interdisciplin› ary  research team  consists  of  124  scientists  and  engineers sup› ported by  twenty-nine technical and fifty-eight administrative personnel. Nine  of  the  staff  members are  military personnel.

In  fiscal year  1982, CERL's  program totaled  $18.5  million,  of which $9.5  million  was direct  funding for  research, development, test, and evaluation and $9  million was  reimbursable funding from  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Engineers, Corps  divisions  and districts, major  Army  commands, the  Defense  Logistics  Agency, the Defense Nuclear Agency, the Defense Communications Agency,  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  and the  U.S . Navy.  In  the  twelve› month  period ending 30  September 1982,  the  U.S.  Army  Con› struction Engineering Research Laboratory had a  number of products which the Corps successfully field tested and implemented.

Lt.  Gen.  Joseph K.  Bratton, the  Chief  of  Engineers, recom› mended that  the  Army  adopt the  Pavement Maintenance Man› agement System  (Paver), developed by  CERL,  as  an  optional system.  Paver  is  a  computer program designed to  help Army facility  engineers determine the  best  maintenance program for streets  and  roads . In  addition, the  American Public  Works  Asso› ciation  selected  Paver  to  test  in  six cities:  Ann  Arbor, Michigan; Hayward, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Sparks, Nevada; Tacoma,  Washington; and  Tampa, Florida.  Some  sixty cities and counties  contributed $200,000  for  the  test.  The  city of  Hamilton, Ontario, also  chose  it  for  implementation. Paver  is the  first  sys› tem  to  assist  the  city  manager, the  pavement engineer, the  air› port  manager, and  the  state  highway  engineer in finding  optimal solutions  with  limited repair and  maintenance funds.

Another  CERL project,  the  Computer-Aided Engineering and Architectural Design  System  (CAEADS),  received  pilot  testing  at the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Engineers by  a  private architectural and  engineering firm  under contract to  the  Corps. CERL  cre› ated  CAEADS  to  produce the  first 25  percent of  any  Military Construction, Army,  design and the  associated cost  estimates. Congress, in  an  effort to  have  realistic cost  estimates, required the  Corps  to submit  35 percent  of the  design  of any new construc› tion  project before it  would  consider funding the  project. The pilot  test  produced more  than  one  hundred projects  in the  fiscal year  1984 Military  Construction, Army,  program at  a fraction of the  cost  and time  required by  standard methods. CAEADS  be› came  the  first  system  in  the  public domain that architects and engineers could  use  to  evaluate their facilities.

The  U.S. Army  Training and  Doctrine  Command (TRADOC) used  the  Directed Stationing System,  originally called  the  Mobili› zation Facilities Planning System, at  Fort Monroe, Virginia, in MOBEX 83. Within  minutes this  automated system  developed by CERL  allows  planners to  test  various responses to  any  assigned scenario to  discover how  an  installation might  best  meet  real  or anticipated mobilization needs.

The Corps of  Engineers implemented the Vehicle Mainte› nance  Facility  Pollution Control Concept, another CERL project, following successful field tests  at  Fort Lewis,  Washington, and Fort  Polk,  Louisiana. The  concept  called  for  centralized washrack facilities  to  control and  treat waste  water  from  washing  vehicles. It also  improved waste-oil  handling and  maintenance cleaning at vehicle  maintenance complexes. Following the  new  procedures, washing  a tank  took  six minutes in  the  tests  compared with  thirty minutes using  the  normal routine.

CERL  made  a breakthrough in  corrosion protection with  the development of  the  ceramic anode. Anodes  are  constructed with sacrificial  coverings and  are  installed on  metal  structures, such  as lock walls, hinges,  water  towers,  and  water  pipes,  to prevent their corrosion through contact with  water.  The invention makes  cor› rosion protection available at  one-fourth the cost  and in  a  re› duced  size-500 times  by weight-that allows installation in  areas previously too  small.  The  ceramic  anode has  at least  the  same  life as  the  bulky, forty-pound, silicon-iron anodes used  in  cathodic protection for  the  past  thirty years, a  technology now  obsolete. At  the end of  the fiscal  year, CERL  was  field testing ceramic anodes  on  lock  gates  at  Millers  Ferry in  the  Mobile  Engineering District; on  water  towers  at  Fort  Eustis,  Virginia, and  Fort  Ord, California; and  on  underground pipes  at  Fort  Carson, Colorado, and  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana. CERL  also  successfully field  tested its pipe  corrosion monitor at  Fort  Carson and  Fort  Polk.  The  moni› tor is  an automated device that can determine the degree of corrosion of  underground pipes  without having to  excavate.

During 1982,  CERL  published technical reports explaining the  purpose of the  Engineering Modeling  Study.  These  included three  manuals: one  explaining how  engineer officers in  the  field might  use  the  model; another showing how  a  systems  program› mer would physically load the magnetic tapes containing the program into  a  computer; and  the  executive summary for  deci› sion  makers, written in  nontechnical language. The Combined Arms  Research Activity  tested the  model at  Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  At  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year, CERL  and  the  Combined Arms  Research Activity  were  in  the  last  stages  of  integrating it

into the Combined Arms Center's Corps-Division Evaluation Model,  one  of  the  hierarchy of  computers at  Fort Leavenworth used to  simulate combat. The engineer model is  the first one developed to  determine the  impact of  engineers on  the  outcome of  battle.

The U.S.  Army  Materiel Development and  Readiness Com› mand  (DARCOM)  approved the  weld-quality monitor developed by  CERL  and included it  in the Manufacturing Methods and Technology Program for the production of  the M 1 tank. The weld-quality monitor is  an  automated technique for  evaluating welds  during the  welding process. The  welder's torch  is actually connected to  a computer programmed to  monitor certain factors, such as  whether the rods are receiving the correct current, whether  the  right  temperature is achieved,  and  whether the  metal is melting as  desired. The  information allows  the  welder to  cor› rect  errors before  he  finishes.  The  cost savings  that  led  DARCOM to  adopt the  monitor are  twofold: (1) a reduction in  the  number of  post-weld inspections and  (2) a  reduction in  the  incidence of defects. The  Navy  investigated the  problem and  concluded that between 10  percent and 12  percent of  all  welds done in the traditional manner are  defective. Furthermore, the  Navy  discov› ered  that  it cost  five  times  as much to  repair a weld  as to  make  it originally. The monitor reduces defects to  less  than 3  percent.

CERL  completed work  on  the  Solar  Economic Feasibility  As› sessment  Method (SOLFEAS).  This  user-friendly computer pro› gram  allows  solar  energy to  be  evaluated for new  construction processes, as  mandated by Congress, within  fifteen minutes and at  an average cost  of  $50, compared with  a  cost  of  $5,000 to $20,000 using traditional methods. Also  in  the area of  solar energy,  construction ended on  a photovoltaic power  demonstra› tion project at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, developed by  CERL. The  project, a  five-kilowatt system  that  converts solar  energy to electricity  at  a remote site,  is connected directly  to the  commerical utility without battery storage. At  the end of the fiscal year, CERL  had  begun a  checkout test.

Fort  Leonard Wood,  Missouri, successfully tested the  Porta› washer,  a CERL  device  to clean  dumpsters by using  high-pressure, hot-water washing  equipment while  employing a vacuum  system to  retrieve the  dirty wash  water. During the  first  six  months of 1982,  Fort Leonard Wood  cleaned 1,000  dumpsters with the Portawasher at  a  savings  of  nearly 75  percent.

As  part of  ongoing research to  evaluate technology for  the problem of  handling human waste  at  remote sites,  CERL  began field  tests  of  the  com posting toilet  at  Fort  Leonard Wood  in June

1982 with  the  installation of two units  at a firing  range.  Based  on the results of  this research, the Army  ordered six  additional units two  for Fort Irwin, California, two  for Fort Dix, New Jersey,  and  two more  for  Fort  Leonard Wood.  The  toilets,  still in the  testing  stage,  had  an  average cost  of  $15,000  to  $18,000  per unit, an  expense which  CERL  hoped to  reduce markedly once the  toilets  went  into  full-scale  production.

Three foam  domes each  with  twenty-eight-foot diameters, designed by  CERL  and  constructed at  Fort Leonard Wood  in December 1981,  continued to  meet  design  criteria at  the  end  of the  fiscal  year. The domes, constructed of  polyurethane foam sprayed  on  an inflated membrane form,  were  built  in an  average of  twelve  hours  each  under adverse  weather conditions-40° F., in a wind  gusting  from  ten  to twenty-five  miles per  hour.  Similar› sized domes, previously constructed under more favorable weather  conditions, required approximately eight  hours  each  to build.  The  domes  are  cost competitive  with  general-purpose tents and  are  more  durable, insulated, and structurally stable.  They offer  impressive opportunities for  mobilization housing.

CERL  also  developed a  Multiattribute Aid  for  Prioritization System  (MAPS),  a computer program which  ranks  the  develop› ment of products and systems  according to  user needs. The ranking is based  on  six  major  characteristics, which  are  broken down  into  fifteen  elements, each  with  a scoring  range  from  zero to  one  hundred. Each  element is weighted based  on  its  impor › tance  to the  characteristic. Products and  systems are  then  scored. Examples  of elements  include  such  questions  as who is interested in  the  project and  how  long  the  Army  will use  the  information gathered in  the  project after  it ends. If a major  general is inter› ested  in  a  project, it  receives  one  hundred points . If a colonel  is interested, the  project receives  eighty points. Projects  in  which lower-ranking officers  are  interested receive  no  points.  The  same system operates  with regard  to the  second  element.  Projects  which the  Army  will  find useful ten  years or  more after completion receive  high  scores;  projects useful for  shorter periods of  time receive  correspondingly fewer  points.  The  usefulness of the  sys› tem depends,  of course,  upon  the  assumptions  built into weighting the  elements. The  weighting  was done  by a committee consisting of  the  commander of  CERL,  the  CERL  laboratory director, and the  CERL  technical  director. During 1982 representatives from Bell Telephone Laboratories and  the  Gas Research Institute re› quested additional information about the system  for possible application to  their research and  development decisions.

In 1982,  several federal agencies used the Environmental

Technical Information System (ETIS) developed by  CERL  to assist  in  preparing environmental impact  statements and  assess› ments  within  the  Department of Defense.  State  and  local govern› ments, planning firms, and  architectural and  engineering busi› nesses  expressed strong interest in  the  system.  To  meet  this  in› creasing  demand, CERL  in  1981 began  to transfer the  system  to the Bureau of  Urban and Regional Planning Research at  the University  of  Illinois.  The  bureau functions as the  sole operating contractor; it serves  as a clearinghouse for  all ETIS  information. With  this  increase in  access, the system recorded 550  log-ins, which  are  separate uses  of  the  program, in July 1982  alone.

CERL  also  developed the  Installation Compatible-Use Noise Zone  technology consisting of  sensors and  mapping equipment. The sensors define the noise patterns at military installations and  provide raw  data  for  the  production of  noise-pattern maps. The maps, which look much like  elevation lines on  a  terrain map, define the noise footprint produced by  machine shops, airports, firing  ranges, and  similar  activities  as well as the  move› ment of  men and materiel to  and from these locations. They indicate  where  planners should  not locate  housing,  troop  quarters, hospitals, and  other facilities  for  which  external noise  might  dis› rupt  their  smooth  operation. The  existence  of  noise  zone  technol› ogy has  allowed  a cooperative effort to develop  between  installa› tions and  adjacent  communities in order to prevent  noise-sensitive developments in  high-noise areas.  CERL  estimated that  cost  sav› ings  using  this  technology amounted to $30,000  per  installation.

The  hand-held calculator for  combat  engineers contains five military engineering programs developed by  CERL,  a  critical path  method computation program, and  several  utility  routines. Critical  path computation means that the  calculator follows  se› quential steps that mirror those taken by  combat engineers to complete their assigned tasks.  Utility  routines refer to  software programs that deal  with  certain complementary tasks  oft~n  as› signed  to  engineers, such  as  survey  work.  Engineer troop units in  the United States, Europe, and Korea  were  testing the  pro› grams  at  the  end of  the fisc~l  year. The U.  S.  Army Engineer School  at  Fort Belvoir, Virginia, procured 140  calculators for student instruction and  training. This  marked the  first  time  that the  combat engineer had been able  to  work with  a  calculator rather than  with  charts and  tables  in  field  manuals.

During fiscal  year 1982,  CERL,  in conjunction with  the  U.S. Army  Mobility Equipment Research  and  Development Command (MERADCOM),  the  U.S.  Army  Waterways  Experiment Station, and  the  U.S. Army  Engineer School  successfully  field  tested  the

Foam  Overhead Cover Support System. CERL  designed and developed the  system  to  provide protective cover  for  TOW  and Dragon  missile launchers and  operators. Tests  were  held  at seven Army  and two  Marine Corps installations. The participating troops generally accepted the  system.

The  Department of  the  Army  named four  CERL  employees as recipients of  the  Army  Research and  Development Award  in 1982.Janet H.  Spoonamore, Kenneth H. Crawford, and  Dale  L. Herron received the  award for  their contributions to  CAEADS. Mohamed Y.  Shahin was  honored for developing the Paver system.

## Facilities and  Real  Property

The  Corps  of  Engineers acts  as  the  executive agent for  the Department of  Defense Recruiting Facilities Program. During 1982, the  Corps  completed 1,807  actions  involving  the  establish› ment of  new  recruiting offices and the relocation, expansion, and  upgrading of  existing offices.  At  the  end of  the  fiscal  year the  four services  had  approximately 7,750  recruiting offices.

The  Office  of the  Assistant  Chief  of Engineers (OACE)  estab› lished  a Worldwide Military  Command and  Control (WWMCC) terminal room  to  deal  with  the  enormous changes produced by the  Army's  force  modernization program. The  WWMCC  system will provide the  proper management tools  for  the  mission  of the Office  of the  Assistant  Chief  of Engineers with  regard to Military Construction, Army,  appropriations; the  Family  Housing Man› agement Account (FHMA); the Homeowners Assistance Pro› gram; and the Wildlife Conservation Program. The Directed Stationing System  (DSS),  a  module of  the Integrated Facilities System,  became operational on  the Worldwide Military Com› mand  and  Control System  during 1982. The  Directed  Stationing System  made  Department of  the  Army  Real  Property Utilization Studies  more  responsive to  the  Army  staff,  the  major  commands, and  installations. DSS assets  analyses  provided answers  to  ques› tions  about  the  facility  shortages in  major  commands and  during mobilization exercises.

The  Worldwide Military  Command and  Control room  pro› vided  the  Installation Planning Division  of the  Office  of  the  Chief of Engineers with  an  efficient reporting system  on  which  to base its  studies. This division-the proponent for installation plan› ning  and  utilization, stationing of  the  Army,  realignment studies, the  Directed Stationing System,  and  the  Army  Stationing System and  Installation Plan  (ASIP)-in the  past  had  prepared station -

ing  studies  with  a "stubby  pencil."  Using  the  Worldwide Military Command and Control terminal room, the division prepared studies of  activations, inactivations, interservice or  intraservice transfers of  units,  redesignations, and  changes  of jurisdiction of installations for  the  Army  staff,  the  major  commands, and  instal› lations  in  one-quarter the  time.  The division  also  acquired the capability  to  publish the  Army  Stationing and  Installation Plan on WWMCC terminals.  This  report helps  the  Army  staff  and  the major  commands to  plan construction at  installations based  on aggregate strength within  the  five-year  plan.

On  23  November 1979,  Lt.  Gen.  J. W.  Morris, the  Chief  of Engineers from  July 1976 to September 1980,  formally  commit› ted  the  Corps  of Engineers to supporting the  Army's  moderniza› tion  program. This program calls  for the  fielding of  over  500 new  materiel systems  in  the 1980s  together with  several force restructuring efforts, including Division  86, the  high  technology Light  Division,  and  Army  90.  General Morris  assigned the  task of  providing technical support to  the  Army  staff  and  the  major commands in  identifying all  support facilities  requirements for the  force modernization program to  the Military  Construction Directorate in  the  Office  of  the  Chie,f of  Engineers. To  accom› plish  this  new  mission,  the  division  formed a  team  of  engineers and  architects from  among  current personnel to develop  facility support  plans  (FSP) and  other  advanced  planning guidance.  Dur› ing  the fiscal  year, the Force Modernization Group had pub› lished  twenty-two force structure plans  together with  fifty-five facility  worksheets for the new  heavy  and  light  divisions. The purpose of  the  worksheets is to identify  bottlenecks which  might retard or  even  halt  fielding of  the  Division  86 and  high  technol› ogy  Light  Division  organizations.

The  backlog  of maintenance and  repair  (BMAR) is a measure› ment  at  the  end  of  each  fiscal year  of  planned maintenance and repair work  which  was required but  not  done  because  of  inade› quate  resources. As facilities  aged  and  inflation made  work  more costly,  the  resources available  did  not  keep  pace  with  deteriora› tion  of  the  physical  plant. Consequently, more  and  more  work was added  to the  backlog  during the  1970s. This  growth  reached its  apex  at  the  end  of  fiscal  year 1981  when  the  Operation and Maintenance, Army, appropriation for BMAR  reached some $2.288  billion.  The  major  portion of  this  backlog  was in  Europe where BMAR  was  conservatively estimated at  $1.271 billion. Actually,  the  condition of  facilities  in  Europe was  so  poor that the  BMAR  did  not  realistically  portray the  requirements in  rela› tion  to  maintainance standards.

Fiscal  1982 proved to  be  a  turning point  in  the  Army's  com› mitment to  fix  facilities. For  the first time  in  nearly ten  years BMAR  growth not only stopped, but declined by  some  $249 million.  This was  the  result of  a  significant increase in  funds. Obligations for  maintenance and  repair in  fiscal  year 1982  was 45.8 percent higher than fiscal year 1981.  With a  sustained multiyear program that  meets  the  new  annual requirements and allows  for  resources to  work  off  the  backlog, the  Office  of  the Chief  of  Engineers anticipates significant improvement in  the Army's  deteriorating physical  plant as well as betterment of  the living  and  working conditions of  U.S. forces  worldwide.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the Corps of  Engineers acquired 150,000  acres  of land  for  the  Army,  using  both  military  and  civil works  appropriations, at  a  cost  of  $83  million. Continuing its program of obtaining land  for  other federal agencies,  the  Corps acquired 1,895  acres  for  the  Air  Force.  This  included approxi› mately  200  acres  with  improvements, at  a cost  of  $5.4  million  to expand clear  zones  at  fifteen Air  Force  bases.  The Corps  pur› chased  31  tracts  of  land  containing 2,523  acres  at  a  cost  of  $3.1 million for the Department of  the Interior's Big  Thicket Na› tional  Preserve  in Texas.  This  brings  the  total  acquisition for  this project through fiscal  year 1982  to 1,275  tracts consisting of 73,879  acres  at  a  cost  of  $69.6 million. The Corps obtained 6 tracts  containing 7 acres  at  a cost  of  $1,700  for  the  Department of Energy's  Strategic  Petroleum Reserve  Program . This  brought the  total  acquisition for  the  program through fiscal year  1982 to 1,085  tracts  consisting of  5,590  acres  at  a cost  of  $116.4  million. During 1982,  the  Corps spent  $I.I million  in  payments to  help relocate 150 applicants displaced by its  acquisition activities.

At the  close of  fiscal year  1982,  the  Department of  the  Army controlled 11.8 million  acres  of military  land  worldwide  and  11.  7 million  acres  of  civil works  land  which,  with  improvements, had an acquisition  cost of $16.3  billion  and  $18.9  billion,  respectively. During  the  fiscal year,  the  federal government disposed  of 3,598 acres  of  Army land, acquired through both military and civil works  appropriations and having an  acquisition cost  with  im› provements of  $3 .9  million. In  addition the  Army  declared and reported to  the  General Services  Administration 74,745  acres  of land  and improvements for  disposal, which  had  an  acquisition cost of $240.8  million.  At the  end  of the  fiscal year  the  Army  had leased  to others  37,666  parcels  ofland covering  6.8 million  acres. These  "outgrants" represented land  for  which  the  Army  had  no immediate use,  but to  which  it  wanted to  retain title  either be› cause  of  mobilization needs or projected changes in  the  force structure.

It  was  in  this  context that President Reagan  announced his plan  to sell surplus federal real  property and  use  the  proceeds to reduce the national debt. Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger asked  the  military  services  to explore the  possibility of  declaring as  excess  real  estate  which  they  could  give  up  with little or  no effect  on  defense capabilities.  The  goal was to identify for  this  purpose several  billion  dollars  of  real  property, based  on its  current fair market value. In a  related matter, President Reagan signed Executive Order 12348  on  25  February 1982, which  placed increased emphasis on  the management of  real property under the  control of  the federal departments. It re› quired  each  executive  agency  to review  its property holdings  and to  report as  excess  those  lands  either not  used  or  underused or not  put  to  best  use.  The executive  order established the  Federal Property Review Board  (FPRB)  and  prescribed the  duties  of the board,  one  of which  was to set an  annual target  amount of prop› erty  that  each  agency  must  declare as excess.  After  considerable review,  the  Corps of  Engineers determined in  fiscal  year 1982 that 33,518 acres of  civil  works lands were  excess to  project requirements. The  Department of  the  Army  reported these  lands to the  Property Review  Board  and  the  Administrator of  General Services. Of that  total,  the  Property Review Board  included  27,642 acres in its preliminary inventory of unneeded federal real property.

## Physical  Security

One  objective  of  the  Army physical security program is  to provide  commanders with  the  flexibility  to  tailor  their  resources to  meet  local  security needs. In  this  endeavor, the  U.  S. Army Military  Police  Operations Agency,  a  field  operating agency  of the  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel with  assis› tance  from  the  U.S.  Army  Concepts  Analysis  Agency,  developed a risk  analysis  methodology that  local  commanders could  use  to assess  their particular security risks  and determine the  level  of security  necessary to  protect the  unit 's  assets.  The risk  analysis procedure encompassed five  major categories: importance and cost of the  assets,  mission  impact,  vulnerabilities, criminal  threat, and  terrorist or  hostile threat. The  Physical  Security Branch of the  Military  Police  Operations Agency  drafted a  seri es of  ques› tions  for each  risk  category, which  it  distributed to  the major commands for  comments. Responses to  these questions would determine the risk value-low, medium, or high-for each category.  The  commander would  then  place  the  risk  values  on  a

matrix  that  would  indicate the  level  of  security  most  appropriate for  implementation. Maj.  Steven Petersen, who  developed this risk  analysis procedure, found the approach especially useful because it  could be  adapted to  the individual needs of  each command. It  allowed flexibility for requirements to  change as the  threat changed, and  it considered internal as well as external risks .  Because of  its  simplicity, the commander could become actively  involved in  deciding what  physical  security measures to use.  He  did  not  have  to  depend on  a specialist  to  manipulate the matrix. Its simplicity also  meant that the procedure could be completed in  a  short time  and that all  levels  of  the command could  easily  understand it.

InJune 1981, discussions  between  Maj. Gen.  Willard  L. Webb, the  Assistant Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for  Personnel, and  Lt.  Gen. LaVerne E.  Weber, the Chief of  the National Guard Bureau, resolved the  issue  of  whether AR  190-11, Physical  Security of Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives, should apply to  the Na› tional  Guard Bureau. They  agreed to  allow  the  Army  National Guard  to establish  its own  policies  and  procedures for  the  physi› cal security  of  arms,  ammunition, and  explosives  under the  con› trol of  the nonfederalized Guard. They also  agreed that the Army  National Guard would  follow  the  spirit  and  intent of  AR 190-11  and  Department of Defense  Manual  5100. 76-M,  Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives,  and  that  General Weber  would  forward all proposed regulations to  the  Department of  the  Army  for  approval before publication. The  resolution of  this  issue  allowed  the  Department of  the Army  to  publish AR  190-11 on 15  October 1981  and distribute it  to  the field.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  Army  discovered 178  weapons missing  from arms storage facilities. The U.  S.  Army Military Police Operations Agency  blamed  weapon  losses during the  year on  negligence by  the individual to  whom the weapon was  as› signed  or  on  theft  by unit  members or  unknown persons. Losses of  ammunition and  explosives amounted to  98,695 items.  The Military  Police  believed that these losses  were  due to  thefts by members of  the  unit or  by  persons unknown and  to  inventory shortages. Missing  items consisted of  single weapons or  small quantities of  arms, ammunition, and explosives. The Military Police  attributed the  reduction in  losses  of  conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives during 1982  to  a  continuation of the  policy  of  providing security to  areas  where the  weapons are stored  and  an  Armywide command emphasis  on  management of weapons  from  the  time  of their  production until  their  destruction, that  is,  throughout their life  cycle.

## Special Services

Civil  Works

The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Civil Works)  supervises, directs, and manages the Army  Civil  Works  Program. In  that capacity  he  has  exercised leadership in  setting forth the  Reagan administration's policy  of  increased cost  sharing and upfront financing for planning, constructing, operating, and maintain› ing  federal water  resources projects. Legislation was introduced this  year, but not enacted, to  . recover capital operational and maintenance costs  for  deep draft and  inland waterway  projects. Initially, recovery would be  sought for the  starts of  both new project construction and  new  feasibility  studies and  for  recrea› tional  development.

## Development of  "Two-Phase" Planning

During  fiscal year  1982, the  administration's policy of greater reliance  on  state  and  local initiative  and  the  reduction of  federal outlays  was extended to  planning studies  for  potential new  civil works projects.  The  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  (Civil Works), in  conjunction with  Corps of  Engineers planners, developed a proposal  for  two-phase  planning, under which  costs for  an  initial reconnaissance study would be  borne entirely by  the federal government, but  costs  for  a  full  feasibility report and  environ› mental impact statement would be  shared with local project sponsors.

Testifying before the  Subcommittee on  Energy and Water Development, House Appropriations Committee, in  February 1982,  Assistant Secretary of  the  Army  William  Gianelli  stated:

I  am  concerned with  the  length of  time  it  takes  to  complete a  typical feasibility  study, the  high  cost  of  individual studies, and  the  high  pro› portion of  unfavorable studies uron which  substantial resources have been  expended. I,  therefore, fee it  is imperative that  we  take  steps  to allow the  Corps  to  concentrate its  planning resources, manpower and budgetary, on  the  more  important studies  which  have  the  best  chances of  implementation.

I  am  proposing that, beginning in  fiscal  year 1983,  all  new  studies pertaining to srecific proolem areas  be  undertaken in  two  phases.  The first  phase wil be  a  reconnaissance phase financed 100  percent with

Federal  funds  and  normally  completed within  a year.  The  second  phase will be  a feasibility  study  to  be  cost  shared with  local  project  sponsors. I would  view  the  reconnaissance study to  be  fully funded when  it  re› ceives  its initial  appropriation. It  would  establish: the  definition of  the problem and  its potential solutions; a determination of  whether or  not the  study proceed further, based  on  a  preliminary appraisal of  costs, benefits, and  environment impacts  of  alternative solut10ns;  an  estimate of  the  costs  of  the  second phase  of  the  feasibilitY.  study;  and  identifica› tion  of  local  sponsors and  mdications of  their willingness  to  participate in  the  feasibility  study on  a cost-sharing basis.

I  believe  that  this  procedure will not  only  speed up  the  planning pro› cess, but  will increase the  proportion of  studies whICh leads  to  success› ful  solutions of  problems.

## Regulatory  Program

The  Corps  of  Engineers reviews  applications for  permits for dredge and  fill  projects and  other construction-related activities in  U.S.  waters. Under Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water Act,  Sec› tion 10 of  the  Rivers  and Harbors Act,  and Section 103  of  the Marine  Protection Research and  Sanctuaries Act,  16,800  permit applications were  reviewed and  decisions reached in  fiscal  year 1982.  Tens of  thousands of  additional minor activities are  cov› ered  each  year  by general permits, which  are  issued  to the  public at large  and  eliminate the  need  for  formal processing of  individ› ual  permit applications.

The  regulatory program of  the  Corps of  Engineers had  be› come  needlessly burdened by red  tape  that  caused excessive  de› lays  in  the processing of  individual permit applications. Conse› quently, the program was  designated for review by  the Task Force  on  Regulatory Relief, chaired by  Vice  . President George Bush. On  7  May  1982,  the task force announced a  series of reform measures the Corps would undertake to  streamline its regulatory program.

These reforms, to  be  implemented over  an  extended period of time,  addressed the  following  areas:  reducing uncertainty and delay  in  the  processing of  permit applications, giving  the  states more  authority and  responsibility, reducing conflicting and  over› lapping policies,  expanding the  use  of general permits, and  clari› fying  the  jurisdictional scope  of  the  program.

Pursuant to  the  task  force  directive, in July the  Army  signed new  memoranda of  agreement with  the  Environmental Protec› tion  Agency and the Departments of  Interior and Commerce. These agreements sought to  alleviate "to  the maximum extent practicable, duplication, needless paperwork, and  delays  in  the issuance of  permits."

These federal agencies have  the  responsibility of  comment› ing  to  the  Corps about  the  environment, wildlife,  and  other as› pects  affected by  proposed dredging or  filling  operations. The previous  memoranda had  provided for  four  layers,  or  elevations, of  automatic review  of  individual permit decisions  whenever a commenting agency  disagreed with  the  approach adopted by the Corps.  This  procedure often  resulted  in long  delays, which  would be  greatly reduced by  the  new  memoranda.

In  addition, on July  22, the  Corps  issued  its first  formal  regu› lations implementing some  reforms. The regulation primarily covered  administrative procedures to reduce  processing  time  and the  expansion of  nationwide (general) permits.

In May  1982,  President Reagan directed the Secretary of Defense  to  prepare a comprehensive plan  for  the  long-term solu› tion  of  flood control and navigation maintenance problems in the  Mount St.  Helens area. The  eighteen-month $1.25-million investigation was scheduled for  completion in  November 1983. An emergency situation arose  at  Spirit  Lake  caused  by the  rising water  level,  which  heightened concern over  the  stability  of  the debris  avalanche trapping the  lake.The increased potential for failure  of  the  debris dam  during the  1982-1983 water  year  and the  resulting damages downstream on  the  Toutle and Cowlitz rivers  caused President Reagan  to  make  an  emergency declara› tion  on  19 August 1982,  calling  for  both  interim and  long-range solutions  to  the  problem. The  Portland District  Office  contracted to  have  an  interim solution pumping-in place  and  operating by  November 1982  to  alleviate  the  immediate emergency. The cost  estimate for  this  was  $11.5  million,  which  was  funded with Public  Law  84-99 supplemental funds provided by  Public  Law 97-216.

The  Dam  Safety Assurance Program, initially  funded in fiscal year  1980,  examines older completed Corps  of  Engineers dam projects  in  order to  identify and  modify  those  which  are  consid› ered  potential safety  hazards. Studies  of  potential problems, and all preconstruction, planning, and  construction estimates  of  un› der $5  million, would be  accomplished with Operation and Maintenance funds. All  construction estimated to  cost  over  $5 million  would  be done  with  Construction, General, funds. Fiscal year  1980 appropriations included $8  million  of  Operation and Maintenance, General, funds for studies and  designs involving 170  projects, while  from fiscal  year 1981  appropriations came $20.3  million  for 130  projects. Fiscal  year 1982  appropriations included $21  million  of  Operations and  Maintenance, General, funds  for  studies and  designs  on  124  projects and  $9.3  million for  construction on  3  projects.

In  the  EPA  (Environmental Protection Agency)  Superfund (toxic and  hazardous waste clean-up) field,  an  interagency agree› ment  between EPA  and  the  Army,  signed  on  3 February 1982, allowed  the  Corps  to  carry  out  design,  construction, and  techni› cal assistance  programs for  the  EPA.  Assignments through fiscal year  1982  were  the  following:

| Construction:                         |            |                    |
|---------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| North Atlantic Division-Lehigh, Pa. . | $1,157,200 | Contract under way |
| Kin Bue, N.J. . ...................   | 2,145,000  | Una warded         |
| LiPari, N.J. . ....................   | 1,589,150  | Unawarded          |
| Bruin Lagoon, Pa. . .. .............. | 3,358,000  | Una warded         |
| Ohio River Division-Chem Dyne, Ohio   | 2,798,000  | Unawarded          |
| Missouri River Division-Aidex , Iowa  | $465,000   | Una warded         |
| Design: None                          |            |                    |

EPA  provided a  general fund of  $200,000 to  cover small  and miscellaneous tasks,  which  could  be authorized at  the  EPA  head› quarters level.

Work  assignments from  the  EPA  regions came  more  slowly than first expected, and by  the  end of  fiscal  year 1982,  it  ap› peared that  the  workload would  not  reach  full  momentum until fiscal year 1984.  Since  the  EPA  Superfund program was an  op› portunity to demonstrate the  Corps'  ability  to  perform work  for other agencies, responsive service and close  working relation› ships  with  the  EPA  regions were  critical  for  success.  The  design center concept was  being implemented at  the Corps' Missouri Division,  which  provided the  specialized expertise and  capabili› ties necessary  to perform Superfund assignments. Central  to this concept  was the  development of  "centers of competence" in  spe› cific  technical disciplines that could support the entire Corps. For  the  Superfund, these  disciplines  included chemists,  chemical engineers, toxicologists, and  industrial hygienists. Integrating chemical health and safety  aspects into  Corps design and  con› struct activities  was  a  major responsibility of  the  design  center.

A five-year,  $8-million  Shoreline Erosion  Control  Demonstra› tion  Program to  develop,  demonstrate, and  disseminate informa› tion  on  low-cost  shore protection was completed. The  program involved  the  evaluation of  means,  including vegetation, that  pri› vate property owners  on  low wave-energy shorelines could  use  to protect against erosion damage. More  than 250  devices  were investigated, while  over  70 were  planned, designed, constructed, and  monitored by selected  Corps  of Engineers coastal  districts  at sixteen sites. Data was  analyzed and a  series of reports was

prepared. A final  report on  the  program detailed the  experience with  each  device  at  the  sites  and  included extensive evaluations of  the  structural and  functional behavior, along  with  time,  cost, and maintenance estimates. This report was  submitted to  the Secretary of  the  Army  on  1 June 1982.

The  major  results  of  the  program, however,  were  the  produc› tion  of  a 36-page, full-color brochure, which  presented an  over› view of  the  program, and three reports that took  specific  site results  and transformed them  into  generic design  and  decision criteria for three specific audiences. The first report, for the private property owner, instructed the  reader on  how  to  make rational decisions on  whether or  not  to  commit responsibilities on the  problems, actions,  and  consequences involved  with  shore› line erosion  and  control. A series  of workshops was conducted to transfer the  results  of  the  program effectively  and  efficiently to the  Corps  coastal  districts. In  addition, an  audio-visual package was  prepared to  assist  district personnel in  disseminating the results  of  the  Section  54  program to  the  public.

Section  12 of the  Water  Resources Development Act of  1974 (Public Law 93-251)  enabled  the  Secretary  of the  Army  to review annually and recommend to  Congress deauthorization of  se› lected  water  resources projects.  As a result  of this  program, seven annual reports have  been  submitted to  Congress and  465  pro› jects  have  been  deauthorized. The  aggregate construction value is $4.43  billion  in terms  of actual  dollars  calculated at  the  time  of the  last  update of  project costs-in some  cases,  in the  late  1800s. The funding appropriated for this program to  date was  $1.9 million.  Key benefits included the  clarification of  federal intent for  potentially affected local  residents, improved management of information, and  more  accurate representation of the  backlog of  unconstructed projects.

## Environmental  Protection and Preservation

During  fiscal year  1982,  the  Army  revised  and  published AR 200-1, "Environmental Protection and Enhancement." This regulation brought Army  policy  into  line  with  national goals  for protecting and  enhancing the  environment. Major  policy changes were put  into  effect  in the  areas  of hazardous waste management, environmental noise  abatement, and  toxic  and  hazardous mate› rial  management.

To  implement the National Environmental Policy  Act,  the Army  published Interim Change 101 to AR 200-2  on  22 Decem› ber 1981.  It  emphasized the need to  integrate environmental

documents with  other planning documents, rescinded the re› quirement to prepare environmental impact statements (EIS) for  ongoing missions,  and  provided for  major  command process› ing of certain  EISs.  On  15 September 1982, these  interim  changes were  incorporated into  Change 1, AR  220-2.

In  the  field  of  waste  management, Congress passed  the  Mili› tary  Construction Codification Act,  Public  Law  97-214, on 12 July 1982.  This  law  increased the  amount of  proceeds from  the sale of recyclable  materials  that  could  be spent  at a military  installa› tion  from $50,000 to  $2,000,000. The  scope  of  the  recycle  pro› grams  was  expanded beyond wastepaper, used oil,  aluminum, and  glass to all material sold  as scrap  or  waste.  Reporting require› ments  were  deleted. In  addition, several  important decisions  were made  in  the  field  of  hazardous waste  management. On  26 July 1982,  the  Environmental Protection Agency  promulgated final regulations for  hazardous waste  land  disposal facilities.  This  was the  final  step  needed for  Army facilities that handled (treated, stored, or  disposed) regulated hazardous wastes  to  obtain full permit status. This process, however, would take  several years and  would  depend on  EPA  and  state  priorities. In  addition, the Army  identified its  requirements for hazardous waste  storage facilities  for  Defense Logistics  Agency programming action un› der policies set  forth in  DOD  Defense Environmental Quality Program Policy  Memorandum, DEQPPM  81-3,  "DOD  Hazard› ous  Material Disposal Policy." This cooperative effort should culminate in  the  construction of  adequate facilities  to  store haz› ardous materials that meet  regulatory permit conditions and  is expected to  continue beyond fiscal  year 1985.  DEQPPM 81-5, "Department of  Defense Installation Restoration (IR) Program," was published in  December 1981.  It  directed DOD  components to  revise  their IR  programs to  conform to  a  new  concept plan. Additionally, the  Army  was to develop  a charter for  an  IR  techni› cal  coordination committee, which  it  would chair. Both  actions were  completed during the  fiscal  year.

On  20  April 1982, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Logistics,  and  Financial Management) directed the Assistant Chief  of  Engineers to  establish a  hazardous materials management working group at  the  Army  staff  level  to develop a streamlined approach to  managing hazardous material. Under the  leadership of  the Environmental Division, the group drew up  a  list  of  issues  with milestones and  conducted several work sessions. Major changes in functional responsibility for Army staff elements should follow upon acceptance of  the group's recommendations.

The  EPA  issued  the  National Oil  and  Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan  (NCP)  on  16 July 1982  with  an  effective date of  10 December 1982.  The NCP  named the  Department of  De› fense  as the  on-scene  coordinator for  oil or  hazardous substance releases  from  DOD  facilities  or  vessels and  provided procedures to  be  followed  in  such  emergencies.

Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, won  the  Secretary of the  Army Environmental Quality Award for its  superior pro› gram during 1981.  Fort McClellan, Alabama, was  selected as first runner-up, and the Red  River  Army Depot, Texas, was picked  as second  runner -up.  An  Army  staff  environmental com› mittee  of the  Army  staff judged seven  competing installations on the  overall  quality of  their written presentation and their pro› gram  achievements. Secretary Marsh  presented the  award  at Ab› erdeen Proving  Ground on  22  October 1982.

## Army Energy  Program

AR  11-27,  "Army  Energy  Program," was extensively  revised to  update and  consolidate responsibilities and  to  provide guid› ance  on  the  Army  energy program. For  the  first  time,  the  pro› gram  required full-time energy  management offices  at  all levels, down  to  and  including installations.

The Army's energy goal for fiscal year 1982  was  a  15.6percent reduction from a  baseline consumption level  in  fiscal year  1975 of  288.15  trillion  British  thermal units  (BTU). It only achieved  a  13.5-percent reduction because  of increased training requirements and  equipment modernization. While  the  goal was not  met,  the  reduction represented the  equivalent of  saving  6.  7 million  barrels of  oil  for  a  cost  avoidance of  $355  million.

The  DOD  Energy  Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) promotes energy  conservation by retrofitting existing  buildings. It remains  the  backbone of  the  Army's  Facilities  Energy Conser› vation  Program. To  accomplish  Army  energy  goals, $955  million is required for  the  program in fiscal years  1983-198  7. Since fiscal year  1976, $356,543,000 has been  appropriated for  ECIP . When all  ECIP projects have been completed, the Army  expects to realize  a  yearly  savings  of  $68,690,000. In  addition, an  annual savings  equivalent to  3.1  million  barrels of  oil  is anticipated.

In  1976,  the  Army  initiated the  Energy  Engineering Analysis Program (EEAP) to reduce energy consumption in existing facilities.  Since  then,  energy conservation techniques at each  ma› jor  Army  installation  have  been  studied to determine their  practi› cability  and to  calculate energy savings and cost. Techniques

analyzed included both major and minor building and equip› ment modifications, equipment replacements, energy manage› ment and control systems, and operational and procedural revision. The  results of  the  EEAP  studies were  listed  by  project and  given  a  priority rating in  terms of  energy savings  and  eco› nomic considerations for funding under ECIP or by  military construction authorizations. Low- and  no-cost  projects were  de› veloped  for  implementation by installation personnel. In  addition, conversion from  critical  petroleum-based fuels  to  coal  or  renew› able  energy sources such  as  solar  or  biomass was  analyzed on  a selective  basis .

The Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS)  con› trols  the  operation of  mechanical and  electrical systems  in build› ing  to  optimize energy consumption and  reduce energy and  op› erating costs. During fiscal year 1982, EMCS  suppliers and installers continued to  experience significant delays  in  fielding new systems.  The  most  notable  problems were  in the  areas  of the development of  computer program software and  the  inability  to demonstrate required system  operating capabilities as  specified in  the  procurement contracts. An  EMCS  Program Management Plan  was developed and  implemented which  provided for  a con› sistent  and  coordinated approach to  solving  EMCS  problems. In addition, the  Corps  of  Engineers began  developing a  new  guide specification that  covered the  preparation of  new  buildings to be serviced by  EMCS.  It  also  continued work  on  seven  new  guide specifications dealing with  requirements for  EMCS  transmission media  and  fielded requests for  EMCS  descriptive literature, as well  as  coordinated and  developed joint-service EMCS  training courses  for  both  construction inspection and  operating personnel.

In fiscal year 197 5,  the Office of the Chief of Engineers directed field offices to  include solar heating, cooling, and  do› mestic  hot  water heating on  MCA  projects in  order to  demon› strate the  potential of  solar  energy and  to  allow  the  field  offices to  become experienced in  the  design and  construction of  these systems.  The  initial  effort was  limited to  sixteen projects-three bachelor enlisted quarters, three dining facilities, three reserve centers, a  school, a  dental clinic,  a  hospital, and  a  range opera› tions  center. The  remaining three projects (a  headquarters and classroom building, a  family housing unit, and a  central plant for forty housing units) were partially funded by  the Depart› ment  of  Energy. Since  cost  effectiveness was  not  a  prime con› sideration, these systems probably will  not meet current eco› nomic  requirements.

A  solar energy requirement was  included in  the fiscal  year

1979 (PL 95-356) and  fiscal year  1980 (PL 96-125) Military  Con› struction Authorization acts.  Essentially these  acts  required that engineering economic studies be  undertaken and  that  solar  en› ergy  systems  be  installed,  where  cost effective,  in  all new  facilities. As a result, in fiscal  year 1982,  8 solar  projects  were  operational, including approximately 950  housing units.  In  addition, close  to 115 other projects were  studied and  were  found not  to  be  cost effective. A  few  projects were  cost  effective, but could not  be constructed because  of  a  lack  of  funds.

Several  incidents during the  late  1970s  at  command, control, and  communication (C3) facilities  crucial  to the  national defense had  caused considerable concern within  the  Office  of  the  Joint Chiefs of  Staff (OJCS)  over the reliability of power supplies. Following an  investigation of  the incidents, conducted by  the National  Academy  of Engineers, the  OJCS  recommended to  the Secretary  of Defense  that  the  Secretary  of the  Army  be the  execu› tive agent  for  a program to  assure power  reliability  at critical  C3 facilities. The Secretary of Defense agreed and in December 1981  directed the  Secretary of  the  Army  to  develop and  imple› ment  a program through the  Corps  of Engineers; the  secretaries of  the Air Force and Navy  and the directors of  the Defense Communications Agency  (DCA) and  the  Defense  Nuclear  Agency (DNA) would  provide  support. The  Corps  of Engineers assigned responsibilities for technical program management to  the U.S. Army  Facilities  Engineering Support Agency  (USAFESA)  and the Huntsville Division Engineer. They proceeded to  develop and implement the Power Reliability Enhancement Program (PREP)  for six  C3  sites  that the OJCS  had identified as  first priority. The  sites  were  visited,  a  management plan  developed, and  a  study  advisory group (SAG)  appointed to  advise  the  pro› gram  managers. The  Director of  Engineering and  Construction for  the  Corps of  Engineers chaired the SAG,  which  was  com› posed  of  senior technical managers from  the  services  and  other agencies.  The  technical program managers developed the  scope of  the  work  and awarded contracts for  gathering data at  these first  sites  in  February 1982.  Subsequent contracts were  awarded for analyzing the data and for preparing documentation for projects  or  work  to correct deficiencies. Corrective actions  would be  programmed for  funding over  five  years  beginning i!\_). scal fi year f984. The technical program managers woula also  con› tinue to  evaluate sites  and ensure that corrective actions were completed and  that  all  work  performed at  the  sites  contributed to  and  did  not  detract from  power  availability  and  reliability.

## Small  and Disadvantaged  Business  Utilization

The  Director of  the  Office  of  Small  and  Disadvantaged Busi› ness  Utilization (SADBU)  reported directly to  the Secretary of the  Army  as his principal adviser  and  assistant  for  the  implemen› tation and administration of  all  matters under the  Small  Busi› ness  Act,  Labor Surplus Areas, and Woman-owned Business Programs. The  SADB U office  developed policies  and  procedures to  implement the Army's small  business programs, established and monitored the agency's goals,  and ensured that offices at major commands were properly staffed to  execute these pro› grams effectively. The office conducted outreach, liaison, and source development activities and seminars. It  also  cooperated with  and consulted on  a  regular basis  with the Congress, the Office  of  the  Secretary of  Defense, the  Small  Business Admini› stration, and  other government and  industrial organizations in order to  carry out  its  program.

In fiscal  year 1982,  the Department of  the Army  awarded $5.94  billion  in small  business prime  contracts, or  24.4  percent of the  amount awarded to  all businesses. This  was very  close  to  the goal  of  24.6  percent. Beginning in  fiscal  year 1982,  small  busi› ness  goals  were  expressed in  percentages instead of  dollars. Set› asides  exclusively for  small  businesses-those items  which  could only  be  bid  on  by  small  businesses-increased from  $2.6  billion to  $3.3  billion,  or  13.7  percent of  the  total  dollars awarded. This was  the  highest percentage of  small  business set-asides attained by the  Army  in any  fiscal year.  Contract awards  to small  disadvan› taged  firms  totaled $859  million  in fiscal year  1982 against  a goal of  $676.1 million. This was  an  increase of  $58  million over  the previous fiscal  year.  These figures do  not  include subcontracting dollars. It was estimated that  an  additional $1.5  billion  in subcon› tracting dollars was  awarded to  small  business firms  during the year.

Federal policy  states that businesses owned by  women shall have the maximum opportunity to participate in contracts awarded by  the government. Although there was  no  require› ment  to  give  preference to  such  firms,  Army  contracting offices put  forth their best  efforts to  assist  businesses owned  by women to compete  for  awards.  These  businesses  received  a total  of $166.6 million  in  fiscal  year 1982  awards, which  significantly exceeded the  goal  of  $108.2 million.

During fiscal  year 1982,  the  Department of  Defense initiated the Defense Small Business Advanced Technology Program (DESAT)  to promote innovative solutions to  important scientific

and  technical problems facing  the  defense community by using the  resources of  small  science  and  technology firms.  The  Army awarded thirty-nine contracts under this program, totaling $1.87 million.  Among  the  areas  under investigation were  chemi› cal  vapors; cryogenic milling, carbon-carbon rotating turbine components, ceramic  gun  barrels, artificial  intelligence, laser  gas containers, fuel  cells,  and  water purification.

On  22 July 1982,  the President signed into law  the Small Business Innovation Development  Act (Public Law 97-219),  which directed that  small  businesses get  a  fixed, minimum percentage of  research and  development awards  made  by  federal agencies with sizable  R&amp;D budgets. The  program was administered in the same  manner as  the DESA T  program. Small  businesses would be  asked for proposals of  up to  $50,000 for phase I, with  a possibility  of  $500,000 for  phase II  efforts.

## Summary

Fiscal  year 1982  witnessed the  most  comprehensive military modernization program undertaken since  World War  II.  The program's magnitude, diversity,  and  degree of  technological com› plexity  had ramifications affecting both the  military forces and American civilian society. Presidential commitment, public consensus, and congressional funding made possible this  long overdue upgrading of U.S. military forces. With its share of the  increased defense funding, the  Army could plan and pro› gram the development of  modern, well-equipped, adequately supported, and fully  trained forces capable of  meeting world› wide  military  contingencies. Although stating  a  quantitative need for  additional divisions,  the  Army  concentrated on the  qualitative improvement of its personnel, equipment, training, and  readiness. This  policy  included the  goal  of  fully  manning all field  units  with well-trained personnel equipped with  high-quality, modern weap› ons  and  materiel.

The  active  Army  exceeded both  its  qualitative and  quantita› tive  recruitment goals.  The percentage of  high  school  graduates among enlistees increased during the year. The Army also reached its  recruitment objective three months before the  close of  fiscal  year 1982,  making it  the best  recruiting year  since  the draft ended in  1973.  The Army  was in  the  enviable position of being  able  to select  the  best  people for  recruitment and  retention. Bonus  incentives, generous educational benefits, and  increased pay contributed to  the  attractiveness of  Army  service.  The  Army made  a similar  improvement in  the  retention of  officers. In  or› der to  reduce personnel turbulence and to  improve readiness, the  Army  also  began to  implement major elements of  the New Manning System.

Budget and  strength figures of  the  reserve forces  surpassed those  of  fiscal  year 1981.  Greater incentives, flexible  enlistment and  training options, as  well  as  aggressive efforts to  enlist and keep  high-quality personnel contributed to  their success  in  re› cruitment and  retention. The  nation's depressed economic state along  with  increased international tensions that  created a  patri› otic  groundswell were  favorable influences on  reserve forces  as well as on  active  Army  enlistment and  retention goals.

The  Army  made  considerable progress in  meeting the  mate-

riel  goal  of  a  "Total Army  equipped and  sustained to  win  any land  battle," which  Secretary Marsh  and  General Meyer  estab› lished  in  December 1981.  Furthermore, the  Army  had  numer› ous  new  weapons  systems  either in  production or  being  fielded. Among  the  more  important were  the  Ml  Abrams  tank,  the  Brad› ley fighting  vehicle,  the  AH-64 and  CH-4  7D helicopters, and  the Patriot  air  defense missile  system.  Several  previously distribu~ systems  were  now  entering field units in  quantity. Eventually, the  Army  will field  more than  500  new  systems.

Although fiscal year  1982 was a successful  one  for  the  Army, problems  remained. Severe  equipment shortages still existed  and only  a  long-term investment in  the  modernization and  produc› tion  of Army  materiel could  alleviate  these  deficiencies. In  addi› tion  to  many units having shortages of  authorized equipment, war  reserve stocks  were  also  insufficient for  the  Army's needs. Moreover,  airlift  and  sealift  capabilities  were  inadequate to  trans› port  Army  forces  to meet  global  requirements and  commitments.

The reserve forces, even with improved equipment and manpower, still  did not meet  all  requirements to  fulfill Total Army  commitments. In particular, the strength level of  the pretrained individual  manpower pool  (Individual Ready  Reserve, Inactive  National Guard, Standby  Reserve,  and  military  retirees) remained unsatisfactorily low.  A  numerical imbalance also  ex› isted  among the  enlisted specialties of  the  reserve components, with a shortage  of personnel in the  combat  arms,  but  a surplus  in several  noncombat specialties. Moreover, serious  deficiencies in wartime  equipment requirements remained unresolved .

The pressures of  inflation, deficit spending, and increased public  demand for  reduced defense funding and  for  expanded expenditures for  social programs probably  will affect  future  Army budgets. Faced  with  these constraints, the Army  nevertheless must  plan  and program for improved modernization, sustain› ment,  readiness, and  training in  the  future.
