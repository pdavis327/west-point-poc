## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2017

## 1

## Introduction

The  U.S.  Army  entered  fiscal  year  (FY)  2017  operating  on  a continuing  resolution  instead  of  an  approved  National  Defense Authorization Act. Nevertheless, the service continued building a force able to successfully engage opponents-including those with similar or  even  superior  high-intensity  combined  arms  capabilities-in  an increasingly uncertain and complex environment. During this time, the demand from combatant commands for Army forces remained high, and American soldiers continued to be killed and wounded in action.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

In January  2017,  with  the  transition  to  a  new  presidential administration, Army leadership underwent multiple changes. Secretary of the Army Eric K. Fanning and Under Secretary of the Army Patrick J. Murphy both resigned. Robert M. Speer, the assistant secretary  of  the  Army  for  financial  management  and  comptroller, became the acting secretary of the Army. In December 2016, Presidentelect Donald J. Trump selected Vincent Viola to be the next secretary of the Army, but in February 2017 Viola withdrew his nomination. The  president  nominated  Mark  E.  Green  in  April  2017;  however, Green  withdrew  his  nomination  the  next  month.  In  July  2017,  the president  nominated  Mark  T.  Esper  to  be  the  next  secretary.  Ryan D. McCarthy replaced Speer as the acting secretary of the Army on 1  August  2017  after  the  Senate  confirmed  McCarthy  as  the  under secretary of the Army. McCarthy served as the acting secretary of the Army for the remainder of fiscal year (FY) 2017 as Esper completed the confirmation process.

A Department of the Army general order in January 2017 made several organizational changes to the organization of Headquarters, Department of the Army  (HQDA),  and  its  principal  officials' responsibilities, superseding the general order issued in 2012. The executive director, Army National  Military  Cemeteries,  was  added  to  the  Secretariat,  while  the director of Small Business Programs was removed from the Secretariat. The 2017 general order also deleted the list of responsibilities ascribed to the vice chief of staff, Army, leaving only the initial paragraph from the 2012 general order stating that the vice chief of staff has such authority and duties as the chief of staff, Army, with the approval of the secretary of the Army, delegates to that position.

The National Commission on the Future of the Army released its final report in January 2016. Congress established the commission in the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in large part  over  two  concerns.  The  first  concern  addressed  how  the  Army should best organize and employ its three components with declining resources. The second concern addressed whether the service should proceed  with  the  transfer  of  AH-64  Apache  helicopters  from  the reserve  component  to  the  Regular  Army  as  directed  by  the  Army's Aviation Restructure Initiative.

Congress directed the commission to undertake a comprehensive study of the structure of the Army to assess the size and force mix of  the  Regular  Army,  Army  National  Guard,  and  Army  Reserve, and  make  recommendations  in  those  areas  where  the  commission thought  appropriate.  The  commission  was  to  consider  anticipated mission requirements for the Army at acceptable levels of national risk, in a manner consistent with available and anticipated resources. Additionally, Congress  specifically directed the commission  to study the transfer of all the Army National Guard's AH-64 Apache helicopters to the Regular Army.

In  April  2016,  the  Army  provided  an  initial  assessment  of  the commission's  recommendations  to  the  secretary  of  defense  and to  Congress.  The  House  Armed  Services  Committee  directed  the secretary  of  defense,  the  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff, and  the  chief  of  staff,  Army,  to  provide  written  assessments  of the  commission's  recommendations  by  1  December  2016.  Because the  timing  of  this  directive  fell  in  the  midst  of  departmentwide preparations for the FY 2018 budget request, the Army decided to

delay the report because it would not have fulfilled the request by Congress. The director of the Army Staff sent an interim response to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, notifying them that the service would submit the report with, or shortly after, the FY 2018 budget request.

For each of the commission's recommendations, the Army formed an  operational  planning  team  with  representatives  from  relevant stakeholders. The teams assessed the recommendations, identified and evaluated  options,  and  presented  their  proposed  course  of  action  to senior Army leaders. A council of colonels and a general officer steering committee monitored and guided the teams' work. Both the council and the committee included representatives from the three Army components and the  state  adjutants  general.  After  review  by  the  secretary  of  the Army and the secretary of defense, the Army submitted the required report to the two congressional committees on 6 September 2017.

The Army reported significant progress on assessing and implementing  the  commission's  forty-three  recommendations  since the  initial  report  provided  in  April  2016.  The  service  closed  thirtytwo recommendations. It rejected one recommendation: inactivating two  Regular  Army  infantry  brigade  combat  teams  and  using  these personnel spaces to address shortfalls the commission found in other capabilities. As  the  remaining  ten  recommendations  will  require additional time to fully assess or implement, their expected completion dates range from the end of FY 2017 to FY 2020.

Second Army was inactivated for the fourth time in its nearly 100-year  history  on  31  March  2017,  after  three  years  in  service. It  had  been  activated  in  2014  to  improve  command  and  control between  Army  Cyber  Command  (ARCYBER)  and  the  Army's Network  Enterprise Technology Command  (NETCOM).  The ARCYBER  commander  was  dual-hatted  as  the  commander  of Second  Army,  and  NETCOM  was  assigned  to  Second  Army. No  soldiers  were  actually  assigned  to  Second  Army,  since  the ARCYBER commander chose to use his existing staff to also run Second Army. Although Second Army served an important role by facilitating  the  relationship  between  ARCYBER  and  NETCOM, that role was diminished by a later decision for NETCOM to report directly to ARCYBER.

On 29 November 2016, ARCYBER conducted a groundbreaking ceremony for construction of the Army Cyber Command Complex at  Fort  Gordon,  Georgia.  Currently,  ARCYBER  headquarters  is split between Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Fort Meade, Maryland; and Fort Gordon. Within four years, the headquarters will consolidate at Fort Gordon. The new facilities will support more than 1,300 soldiers and civilian  employees,  and  are  projected  to  be  ready  in  summer  2020. ARCYBER is expected to be fully operational at Fort Gordon by 2022.

Currently,  the  Army  has  fifty-seven  museums  and  the  Army National Guard has forty-eight designated museum activities. Since 2000,  the  Army's  collection  of  artifacts  has  increased  dramatically in size, even as museum staff numbers have declined. In response, in December 2016 the service established the Army Museum Enterprise (AME), a management framework for museums executed by the Center of  Military  History  (CMH).  The  framework  applies  to  all  Regular Army and Army Reserve museums. Its policies and procedures also apply to the accountability and security of Army property in Army National Guard museums.

The AME is a network of museums, training support facilities, historical collections, heritage displays, and support centers that perform education, training, research and development, conservation and preservation, unit heritage activities, and public outreach for the Army. Daily operations of AME museums remain under the direction of the museum's local commander. The AME General  Officer  Steering  Committee  will  provide  senior  leader oversight and will be supported by the AME Working Group. As

the  Army's  proponent  for  museums,  CMH  provides  centralized control,  with  decentralized  execution  at  the  command  level.  The center  also  provides  expertise  in  governance,  funding,  structure, program development, human resources management, and materiel management. CMH recommends management decisions regarding the  AME  to  the  AME  Working  Group  for  the  General  Officer Steering Committee to consider.

## Management

In July 2017, the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) upgraded its technical infrastructure and moved its Business Warehouse capability  to  an  in-system  memory  database.  These  upgrades,  along with upgrades across the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/ Army network, introduced excessive periods of unexpected latency that affected system availability for users. The GFEBS Program Management Office,  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Financial Management and Comptroller), DISA, and the Army Data Center all worked with IBM, the GFEBS system integrator, to make adjustments to both GFEBS and the overall network. These adjustments stabilized the system for year-end processing.

An  independent  public  accounting  firm,  in  November  2016, reported  on  its  audit  of  the  Army's  General  Fund  Schedule  of Budgetary Activity. The scope of the audit included FY 2015 and FY 2016 appropriation  activity  and  an  evaluation  of  information technology controls over the general ledgers in various systems. The firm did not issue an opinion, but it did close 100 findings from the prior year audit and noted the service's success in remediating audit impediments. During the FY 2016 Schedule of Budgetary Activity audit,  the  Army  responded  to  nearly  24,500  audit  samples  and auditor requests.

The  statement  of  budgetary  resources  is  a  financial  statement that summarizes the flow of funds in and out of the Department of the  Army. The FY 2017 statement of budgetary resources audit by an independent public accounting firm identified several deficiencies. Risks associated with these findings included misstatement of balances reported on financial statements, inadequate reconciliation of data originating from various financial management systems, and insufficient controls related to the reconciliation of transactional data populations. In response to these findings, the Army initiated multiple corrective actions.

In April 2017, the acting secretary of the Army directed that HQDA  establish  a  process  for  providing  Army  senior  leaders

greater situational understanding of information technology (IT)  programs,  investments,  and  resourcing.  He  directed  the establishment of a senior review board, known as the Information Technology Oversight Council, cochaired by the under secretary of  the  Army  and  the  vice  chief  of  staff,  Army.  The  council  will integrate activities and assessments in the network mission areas: War  fighting,  intelligence,  enterprise  information  environment, and business. The acting secretary designated the Army's chief information  officer/G-6  (CIO/G-6)  the  lead  integrator, responsible  for  establishing  a  standards-based  architecture.  The Mission  Command Center  of  Excellence  will  be  responsible  for synchronizing  all  tactical  network  requirements.  The  chief  of staff,  Army,  will  be  the  final  approval  authority  responsible  for reviewing  and  validating  requirements  with  operational  needs through the Army Requirements Oversight Council.

The CIO/G-6 maintained ten enterprise license agreements (ELA) for  software  products  from  several  corporations.  During  this  fiscal year,  the  Army  created  a  new  Microsoft  ELA,  replacing  the  one  in effect since 2012. The new ELA provided all Army users a standard, secure desktop environment at a cost savings of more than 50 percent compared to General Services Administration pricing. In accordance with Office of Management  and  Budget  category  management objectives,  the  Microsoft  ELA  streamlines  and  simplifies  software license management and provides a no-cost migration path to future cloud services. It also delivers enterprise strategy advisory consulting services  and  technical  training  opportunities  to  further  support  the Windows 10 software migration and deployment. This support was a valuable benefit at no additional cost to the contract. Furthermore, the Army did not incur additional desktop licensing cost to migrate to Windows 10.

In  late  FY  2016,  the  CIO/G-6  began  developing  a  plan  for the  transformation  of  Army  Knowledge  Online  capabilities.  The transformation plan, approved in early FY 2017, consisted of three two-year increments. The major objectives of the first increment is to replace the legacy Single Sign On capability and upgrade the portal with  modern  capabilities,  personalization,  and  support  for  mobile devices.  The  replacement  for  Single  Sign  On  will  be  the  Enterprise Access  Management  System-Army  (EAMS-A),  which  will  become the  cornerstone  of  the  transition  to  using  public  key  infrastructure credentials for authentication  to  all the various  Army  services. EAMS-A is decoupled from the AKO system and its portal, enabling the portal to be completely overhauled and upgraded. The transition to EAMS-A is expected to occur early in FY 2018. Late in FY 2017, a

contract was awarded to overhaul and upgrade the portal; the work is scheduled for completion in FY 2018.

In  June  2014,  the  undersecretary  of  the  Army  issued  guidance to  establish  the  Army  Application  Migration  Business  Office  and outlined  a  process  for  migrating  enterprise  systems  to  core  data centers.  However,  progress  in  system  and  application  virtualization and rationalization was slow, and the Army did not reach its FY 2016 data center closure target. Additionally, in February 2016, the deputy secretary  of  defense  directed  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  to complete a rapid deployment and transition to Microsoft Windows 10 to strengthen the department's cybersecurity posture and concurrently streamline  the  IT  operating  environment.  These  issues  led  to  a December 2016 directive from the secretary of the Army establishing a plan for rationalizing and modernizing IT systems and applications, migrating  them  to  approved  hosting  environments,  and  closing  or consolidating data centers.

The  directive  set  several  objectives.  All  enterprise  systems  and applications were to be migrated to enterprise hosting environments no later than 30 September 2018, contingent upon the availability of enterprise hosting environments. Army enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, if not already migrated, would be migrated to a DISA Defense  Enterprise  Computing  Center  as  part  of  the  Army  ERP enclave.  The  suspense  for  ERP  migration,  subject  to  availability  of funds, was 30 September 2018. By that same date, only legacy systems and  applications with scheduled  terminations  by  30  September 2020,  and  with  approved  waivers  and  a  supporting  plan  of  action and  milestones,  would  remain  on  Army  networks.  Waivers  were contingent upon these systems and applications continuing to meet the requirements for operating on an Army network.

Installation processing nodes identified in the directive are required to close, as well as any additional nodes identified later, by 30 September 2025. By that date, all Army commands and installations must be compliant with the data center closure targets and procedures in place to monitor establishment of new data centers. The end-state will have ten Army Enterprise Data Centers by 2025. Six of those will be located outside the continental United States. The other four will be located at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Knox, Kentucky; and Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

The  final  objective  set  in  the  December  2016  directive  was completion  of  the  transition  to  Microsoft  Windows  10  by  no  later than 31 January 2017. Organizations unable to meet the suspense date could  request  a  waiver  through  the  appropriate  process  established by the Army CIO/G-6 and DoD. Later in FY 2017, it became clear

this deadline could not be met, and the DoD CIO established a new deadline of 31 March 2018. Organizations were to procure replacement hardware for any Windows 10-incompatible devices by 1 November 2017; those purchases were to comply with the 7 June 2017 CIO/G-6 guidance for life-cycle replacement.

Global Combat  Support System-Army  is a logistics and financial system for both units and installations. It tracks supplies, spare parts, organizational equipment, unit maintenance, and financial transactions related to logistics. The system is based on a commercial software program and is fielded in two waves to avoid disrupting operations. The first wave, completed in November 2015, replaced the Standard Army Retail Supply System and the associated financial management information systems. The second wave, which commenced  in  2015,  will  replace  the  Property  Book  Unit  Supply Enhanced  and  Standard  Army  Maintenance  System-Enhanced. Completion of the second wave is expected during the first quarter of FY 2018.

The  Program  Office, Army  Enterprise  Staff Management System,  was  established  in  October  2016.  Its  first  undertaking was digitizing  the  HQDA  staff  action  process.  In  June  2017,  the office replaced HQDA's Tasker Tracking System with a proprietary, commercial-off-the-shelf Task Management Tool system for both Non-Secure  and  Secure  Internet  Protocol  Networks.  This  tool eliminates  all  paper  copies  in  the  staffing  process-documents can be created, edited, routed, and signed digitally. The tool also provides  transparency  and  accountability  for  work  in  progress, creates an archive of completed staff actions, and interfaces with Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense's  (OSD)  Correspondence  and Task Management System.

A December 2016 memorandum from the administrative assistant to the secretary of the Army established a policy for HQDA principal officials on procuring and presenting custom minted or manufactured emblazoned  coins.  These  coins  recognize  acts  of  exceptional  or unique service among HQDA employees. The policy authorized these officials to spend up to $3,000 in appropriated funds each fiscal year to purchase coins. Except for the secretary of the Army; the chief of staff, Army; the under secretary of the Army; the vice chief of staff, Army; and the sergeant major of the Army, the administrative assistant to the secretary of the Army must approve any purchases exceeding  $3,000  in  a  fiscal  year.  Except  for  the  secretary  of  the Army; the chief of staff, Army; the under secretary of the Army; the vice chief of staff, Army; and the sergeant major of the Army, personalized coins with the name of the principal official on the coin

are  not  authorized.  All  officials  are  required  to  maintain  a  record of coin expenditures by fiscal year. Coins may not be presented to contractors, and those receiving coins must be employees paid from appropriated funds.

## Budget

Congress had not approved a budget for FY 2017 by the end of  FY  2016.  Instead,  for  the  eighth  consecutive  time,  the  Army began  a  new  fiscal  year  funded  by  a  continuing  resolution.  This measure permitted operations at the rate provided for in the FY 2016 appropriations act ( Tables 1, 2, 3 ,  and 4 ). No funding could be  used  to  start  new  programs  or  expand  ongoing  programs.  No new  multiyear  procurements  could  be  made  utilizing  advance procurement  funding  for  economic  order  quantity  procurement. The uncertainty of funding levels created challenges for leaders at all levels in planning and executing their programs efficiently. These challenges continued for the majority of the year, as FY 2017 saw the longest period to date-216 days-in which the Army operated under  a  continuing  resolution.  Only  on  6  May  2017  did  the  FY 2017 appropriations act become law.

Military personnel appropriations were almost completely spent by fiscal year's end. The direct Army civilian pay for FY 2017 was  $14.1  billion  and  the  budgeted  pay  was  $14.3  billion.  Direct full-time  equivalent  execution  was  130,000  and  the  budgeted  fulltime equivalent was 129,400. Executed civilian pay was lower than budgeted  pay  because  of  a  hiring  freeze  in  the  second  quarter of  the  fiscal  year  and  extended  operations  under  a  continuing resolution.  The  operations  and  maintenance  appropriations  had unexecuted  balances  of  $78  million  in  the  base  budget  and  $48.8 million in overseas contingency operations appropriation at the end of FY 2017. Most of the remaining balance in the operations and maintenance accounts was because Congress refused to allow it to be reprogrammed to other accounts.

In  the  FY  2017/2019  procurement  appropriations,  the  Army obligated 70 percent of the funds. The service missed the 80 percent obligated in the first  year  of  availability  goal  set  by  OSD  primarily because  the  appropriations  were  not  available  until  5  May.  As  a secondary cause, the Army Budget Office emphasized obligating the FY 2016/2018 procurement appropriations. This emphasis produced a 93 percent obligation of these funds, exceeding the OSD goal of 90 percent. The Army obligated 99.6 percent of its expiring procurement appropriations  from  FY  2015/2017.  It  expended  42  percent  of  its

were  not  awarded  because  of  environmental,  site,  or  solicitation issues, and are projected to be awarded in FY 2018. In the military construction,  Army  Reserve,  appropriation,  forty-two  of  fortyfive projects were awarded. The three remaining projects were not awarded because of environmental, site, or solicitation issues. Two of the remaining projects are scheduled for award in FY 2018 and one in FY 2019.

The Army Working Capital Fund ended FY 2017 with a balance of $1,574.3 million, $226.1 million more than the year's beginning

balance. The change is the result of receiving $225 million in direct appropriations, a congressionally directed reprogramming of $336.0 million, and a cash balance increase of $317.1 million.

In FY 2017, the Army submitted fifteen reprogramming packages, totaling $3.69 billion, requiring congressional approval, a 3.9 percent decrease  from  the  $3.84  billion  submitted  in  FY  2016.  Congress rejected  six  packages,  seven  were  executed  in  September  2017, one will be implemented in October 2017, and one is still pending congressional  action.  During  FY  2017,  the  Army  reprogrammed an  additional  $1.72  billion  in  amounts  below  the  statutory  limits requiring congressional approval.

Congress had not approved a budget for FY 2018 by the end of FY 2017. Instead, for the ninth consecutive time, the Army began a new fiscal  year  funded  by  a  continuing  resolution  ( Tables  5 and 6 ). Although  the  continuing  resolution  does  not  force  any  immediate program cancellations, it permits operations only at the rate provided for in the FY 2017 appropriations act.

FY 2018 President's Budget Highlights , May 2017.



## Army Strength and Distribution

When the fiscal year began, the Army was trending toward a total end strength of 980,000 soldiers in the active and reserve components. The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA)  for  FY  2017 increased  the  Army's  authorized  total  end  strength  to  1,018,000 soldiers. As of 30 September 2017, the Army's total strength stood at 1,014,166 officers and enlisted personnel. The active component end strength was 476,245 personnel: 77,448 commissioned officers, 14,348 warrant officers, 379,868 enlisted soldiers, and 4,581 military academy  cadets.  Women  constituted  15  percent  of  the  Regular Army force structure, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 44 percent.

The  Army  National  Guard  end  strength  on  30  September  2017 was  343,603  personnel:  37,234  commissioned  officers,  8,628  warrant officers, and 297,741 enlisted soldiers. Women constituted 17 percent of the Army National Guard, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 31 percent. The Army Reserve end strength on 30 September 2017 was 194,318 personnel: 34,118 commissioned officers, 3,455 warrant officers, and  156,745  enlisted  soldiers.  Women  constituted  23  percent  of  the Army Reserve, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 48 percent.

## Officers

The  upward  shift  in  manpower  during  FY  2017  authorized an increase of nearly 1,000 officer accessions and retentions. The Regular  Army  brought  in  6,017  new  officers,  while  the  Army Reserve commissioned 1,967 new officers. An additional 2,228 new officers  entered  the  Army  National  Guard.  In  each  component, new  officer  commissions  exceeded  mission  goals.  Of  the  new commissioned officers, 5,420 came from Reserve Officers' Training Corps  programs:  3,183  Regular  Army,  906  Army  Reserve,  and 1,221 Army National Guard. The U.S. Military Academy produced 918.  The  In-Service  Officer  Candidate  School  (OCS)  program commissioned 332: 203 Regular Army, 14 Army Reserve, and 115 Army National Guard. The OCS College Option produced 502: 419

Regular Army and 83 Army Reserve. Another 243 Army National Guard officers commissioned through state-based OCS. Across the three components there were 224 direct commissions into the Judge Advocate General Corps, 2,334 into the Army Medical Department, and 183 into the Chaplain Corps.

The secretary of the Army directed Lt. Gen. Edward C. Cardon, director, Office of Business Transformation, to review the health of the service's general officer corps. Several recent instances of general officer misconduct and the suicide of a major general in July 2016 prompted the review. The review concluded the Army did not have a holistic program focused on the comprehensive health of its general officers. It must better help these officers manage stress, make time for physical fitness, and take appropriate amounts of leave. Senior officers, like other soldiers, need mentors or coaches. A key effort is developing ways to reinforce ethical behavior by developing greater self-control and self-awareness. Pilot programs based on the review's findings and recommendations will be trialed in FY 2018.

The FY 2017 NDAA reduced the statutory limit on general officers and  flag  officers  across  all  services.  However,  the  Department  of Defense (DoD) did not fi  ll all general officer and flag officer billetsand the legislation also allowed for an additional thirty of these billets for overseas contingencies-the limit reduction did not result in cuts. The services, however, could not expand general officer and flag officer billets as their numbers expanded. The law did not include any cuts or caps on Army National Guard or Army Reserve general officers.

## Enlisted Personnel

Despite  a  low  nationwide  unemployment  rate  and  a  midcalendar-year mission increase, the Army met its FY 2017 enlistment recruiting goal for the Regular Army by accessioning 68,862 enlisted personnel (65,713 of them nonprior service). This number was above the original October 2016 goal of 62,500. Almost 96 percent of new recruits  were  high  school  graduates,  and  6,900  entered  the  Army already possessing a college degree. However, 1.9 percent belonged to 'Category 4,' meaning they scored between 10 and 30 points on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery examination. The Army also  granted  506  waivers  for  new  recruits  who  admitted  to previous marijuana use in FY 2017. Women comprised 17 percent of new recruits, and 47 percent were racial and ethnic minorities.

The  Army  National  Guard  began  the  fiscal  year  with  a recruiting  goal  of  40,000.  It  did  not  meet  this  goal,  accessioning 30,491  nonprior  service  recruits  and  another  3,807  prior  service

soldiers,  for  a  total  of  34,298  new  accessions.  The  Army  Reserve recruiting  objective  was  14,000.  It  accessioned  13,272  personnel; 12,468 were nonprior service. Enlistment bonuses across the Army averaged $12,800, and those who entered high-demand specialties drew bonuses as high as $40,000.

As a means of cutting attrition rates during initial military training, the Army  implemented  the  gender-neutral  Occupational  Physical Assessment Test (OPAT). This test assessed a new recruit's fitness for various occupational specialties. Ideally, recruits who score higher on the OPAT will have fewer injuries during initial military training, and will  be  more  apt  to  complete  training.  By  the  end  of  FY  2017,  the OPAT's results were preliminary. A review will take place early in FY 2018. OPAT worked in conjunction with new recruiting efforts aimed at targeting potential recruits with new ad and marketing campaigns. These  efforts  were  the  result  of  statistics  indicating  that  there  were approximately 136,000 potential recruits out of a pool of more than 33 million. Factors for this low number related to medical or physical disqualifications,  obesity,  previous  drug  use  or  misconduct,  and  low mental aptitude among the ages seventeen to twenty-four demographic.

## Civilian Personnel

At  the  end  of  FY  2017,  there  were  266,584  appropriated-fund and 26,780 nonappropriated-fund civilian employees. Army civilians worked in nearly 500 job series. Some civilians were foreign nationals who were funded directly by the U.S. Army; other foreign national employees were funded indirectly by their host nation ( Table 7 ).

In FY 2017, the Army mirrored or exceeded the representation of the total U.S. labor force in three out of five diversity categories (veteran, disability, and minority). Half of the Army's civilians were military  veterans,  compared  to  only  6  percent  of  the  entire  labor force. Ten percent of civilian personnel reported having a disability compared  to  4  percent  in  the  total  labor  force.  Army  minority representation was 32 percent, in line with the total labor force at 31 percent. However, the number of female civilian employees, at 37 percent, was 10 percentage points below the national average. The Army's overall workforce median age (age 50) was eight years higher than the overall labor force.

On  23  January  2017,  the  president  issued  a  memorandum  that directed all federal agencies to implement an across-the-board civilian hiring freeze. The Office of Personnel Management issued hiring freeze guidance  on  31  January  2017,  and  the  deputy  secretary  of  defense issued additional guidance the next day. This guidance authorized the

acting secretary of the Army to grant certain exceptions to the hiring freeze. During the freeze, which lasted until 4 May 2017, there were more than 1,050 exemption requests in the Army. Cumulatively, the freeze affected roughly 46,000 civilian positions across the service.

## Special Topics

The Army extended the contracts of all Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MA VNI) recruits in the U.S. Army Reserve Delayed Training Program by one year to allow time for security vetting. The Army implemented the MAVNI program in 2009 to recruit personnel into  critical  skills,  primarily  language  and  health  care,  outside  of  the population normally authorized for enlistment to meet those needs. It allowed  for  the  enlistment  of  certain  legally  present  noncitizens  who held visas. From 2015, those granted employment eligibility under the Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  policy  were  eligible  for  the MAVNI program. In FY 2017, the Army increased MAVNI program vetting and clearance requirements. Owing to procedural delays and the sheer  volume  of  soldiers  requiring  additional  vetting,  many  MA VNI recruits became subject to discharges from the Army Reserve because of their extended time in the Delayed Entry Program. In FY 2017, the Army did not clear any individuals who accessed through the MA VNI program. The acting secretary of the Army in July 2017 extended the contracts of all MA VNI recruits in the Army Reserve Delayed Training Program by one year to allow time for their security vetting. As a result of the increased vetting-as well as a series of class-action lawsuitsthe Army Board for the Correction of Military Records adjusted the

enlistment  contracts  of  all  Regular  Army  MA VNI  accessions  in  the Delayed Entry Program by one year to allow for security vetting and avoid unnecessary discharges.

The deputy chief of staff, G-1, established a division to implement Army policy on the screening and vetting processes for suitability, fitness, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12. The Army Suitability Program  encompasses  various  avenues  for  determining  individual suitability  for  government  employment.  The  program  examines  an individual's  conduct,  character,  and  any  derogatory  information  that may make someone unsuitable for a government position.

On 30 June 2016, the secretary of defense issued guidance on the retention, accession, separation, in-service transition, and medical coverage  for  transgender  personnel  serving  in  the  military.  The Army  established  a  Transgender  Service  Implementation  Group to develop policies and procedures for transgender service. At the start  of  FY  2017,  the  Army  directed  that  no  otherwise  qualified soldier  may  be  involuntarily  separated,  discharged,  or  denied reenlistment  on  the  basis  of  their  gender  identity.  The  directive further  established  that  Army  medical  providers  could  diagnose and provide medically necessary care and treatment for transgender soldiers. This care included allowing for a gender transition while in the Army.

Along with this initial directive, the Army established protocols where a soldier would begin a transition with a medical diagnosis, and end the transition with an altered gender marker in the Defense Enrollment  Eligibility  Reporting  System.  If  a  soldier  completed the transition, the Army required said soldier to meet all standards for  uniform  and  grooming, body composition, physical readiness testing,  and  other  military  standards  for  applied  genders.  On  30 June 2017, the secretary of defense delayed implementation of the transgender policies for an additional six months to further evaluate their effects on lethality and readiness.

In  February  2017,  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  (Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs)  issued  guidance  for soldiers, civilian employees, and contractors concerning their online conduct.  Guidance  advised  using  a  'Think-Type-Post'  model when using electronic communications devices. Before posting, one should think about the message they are communicating and who might view it. The message should be consistent with Army values, and include only messages that demonstrate dignity and respect for all. Personnel experiencing or witnessing online misconduct should promptly report the incident to their chain of command or through other avenues, such as family support services, equal opportunity

offices, inspector general channels, Army law enforcement offices, and those used for reporting sexual harassment.

The guidance directed a number of actions by HQDA to reinforce professional  online  conduct.  Programs  tracking  misconduct  in areas such as equal opportunity and sexual harassment, as well as inspector general and law enforcement investigations, will update their systems to track online incidents. Steps will be taken to raise awareness  of  online  conduct,  misconduct,  and  response  actions. The standardized programs of instruction and training plans for equal  opportunity,  treatment  of  persons,  sexual  harassment,  and response to sexual assault will be updated with discussion points and  vignettes  concerning  electronic  communications  and  online conduct. The Office of the Chief of Public Affairs will revise the social  media  handbook  with  an  expanded  discussion  of  online responsibilities, protection, and leader response options.

In  2014,  the  assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (manpower  and reserve affairs) established a working group to examine operational, security,  and  ethical  considerations  related  to  using  the  human  capital big  data  maintained  by  the  service.  The  working  group's  efforts produced the Army Human Capital Big Data (HCBD) strategy in November 2016. The HCBD strategy defines an overarching human data use policy and expands an existing technology-Person-event Data Environment-as an enterprise platform for integrating data across the human capital enterprise. This technology links people, data, and tools, and ensures that the Army follows human subject protection  regulations  and  privacy  rules  and  that  Army  human data use can be audited.

After publishing the HCBD  strategy,  the  working  group prepared the HCBD implementation plan, which was approved in August  2017.  The  plan  addressed  governance,  ethical  oversight, phasing  and  tasks  for  implementation,  data  management,  and associated technical processes needed  to support  the HCBD enterprise. The plan established the HCBD Steering Committee as subordinate to the Army Data Board. It consists of representatives from the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs;  the  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-1;  and  the  deputy  chief  of staff, G-8. The committee is tasked with directing the HCBD data governance process. The plan also established three categories of analyses supported by HCBD: descriptive statistics, policy analysis, and research.

During  FY  2017,  the  Army  continued  developing  a  new personnel  system  based  on  the  concept  of  talent  management. Talent  management  capitalizes  on  the  unique  talent  of  soldiers;

talent is defined as the intersection of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and  preferences  in  every  soldier.  At  the  end  of  FY  2016,  the Army  published  a  talent  management  strategy.  In  FY  2017,  the Army  began  the  Assignment  Interactive  Module  pilot  program, implementing  part  of  that  strategy.  This  module  is  a  Web-based portal  designed  to  enhance  officer  talent  management  processes. It exercises a regulated market mechanism that enables interaction among the soldier,  the  unit,  and  assignment  managers  within  an intuitive  marketplace.  This  marketplace  allows  both  officers  and units to advertise themselves, express their preferences, and interact with one another in order to shape both parties' interests to increase satisfaction  and  meet  requirements.  The  portal  greatly  increases information  about  an  officer,  offering  a  resume  with  relevant information  not  otherwise  contained  in  the  traditional  officer record brief. Similarly, units are able to share detailed information about each of the jobs in the marketplace.

The  FY  2016  NDAA  directed  the  implementation  of  a  new blended military retirement system (BRS) by 1 January 2018. This system will blend the traditional pension with a defined contribution system  of  automatic  and  matching  government  contributions through  the  Thrift  Savings  Plan.  The  current  system  provides retirement  benefits  to  the  approximately  15  percent  of  soldiers who serve more than 20 years. Under BRS, all soldiers who serve honorably for at least two years will have some retirement benefits when they leave the service.

The DoD released its BRS implementation guidance in January 2017, and the Army began a program to educate soldiers on their options. Soldiers with twelve years or more active duty service-and National Guard and Reserve members with 4,320 or more pointswill be grandfathered into the current system. Soldiers with less than twelve years active duty service-and National Guard and Reserve members with less than 4,320 points-will have until 31 December 2018 to choose whether to remain in the current system or opt into the BRS. Any soldier who does not opt in by 31 December 2018 will remain  enrolled  in  the  previous  retirement  system.  Soldiers  who enter the service after 1 January 2018 will automatically contribute part of their pay into the Thrift Savings Plan.

To signify the entrance of a soldier into the profession of arms, in FY 2017 the Army began presenting a certificate to all enlisted and officer trainees graduating from initial entry training courses. An  initiative  begun  by  the  Soldier  for  Life  working  group,  the Soldier's Certificate officially recognizes the earned right to be called a soldier. Signed by the chief of staff, Army, and the sergeant major

of the Army, the certificate also symbolizes the Army's promise to take care of soldiers and their families.

In October 2016, the Army revised its procedures for processing and  tracking  requests  for  religious  accommodations  that  require  a waiver  of  Army  Regulation  (AR)  670-1, Wear  and  Appearance  of Army Uniforms and Insignia . Persons intending to enter the Army may now  submit  a  preaccession  request  for  a  religious  accommodation waiver of AR 670-1 and receive a decision before entry. Requests for a religious accommodation waiver of AR 670-1 may be approved or disapproved only by the secretary of the Army or his designee.

Starting  in  January  2017,  soldiers  from  Jewish,  Muslim,  Sikh, and Rastafarian faiths could request approval through their brigade commander  to  modify  their  uniform  to  include  beards,  turbans with unshorn hair, hijabs, and dreadlocks. Soldiers who receive such accommodations must still  be  able  to  wear  the  combat  helmet  and other  protective  headgear.  Because  testing  has  shown  that  a  beard degrades the protection factor provided by current protective masks, soldiers  with  a  religious  accommodation  allowing  a  beard  may  not attend schools requiring toxic chemical agent training, and may not be assigned to positions requiring compliance with biological, chemical, or nuclear safety requirements. Commanders may require a soldier to shave if the unit is in, or about to enter, a tactical situation where use of a protective mask is required and where the inability to safely use the mask could endanger the soldier and the unit.

Also  starting  in January  2017,  female  soldiers  may  wear dreadlocks/locks  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  in  AR  670-1 for  braids,  cornrows,  and  twists.  Additionally,  religious  bracelets, similar  in  style  to  medical  alert,  missing  in  action,  prisoner  of war, or killed in action identification bracelets, may now be worn in  uniform  or  in  civilian  clothes  on  duty  in  accordance  with  the guidance in AR 670-1.

In  June  2017,  the  undersecretary  of  defense  (personnel  and readiness) directed the military services to establish additional measures to  ensure  appropriate  and  timely  recognition  of  extraordinary  acts of  valor.  In  August,  Human  Resources  Command  issued  guidance to  implement this directive. All valor award recommendations from the  field  will  be  processed  for  endorsement  within  ten  calendar days of receipt at each echelon in the chain of command above the initiating unit through the approval authority. In recognition of the inherent  challenges  associated  with  any  event  that  results  in  valor award recommendations, the ten-calendar-day requirement does not apply to the initiating unit, but that unit is still required to exercise due diligence in preparing a recommendation in a timely manner. For

Medal of Honor and Distinguished Service Cross recommendations, the first colonel (or general officer if a colonel is the recommender) to  endorse  the  award  recommendation  will  forward  a  copy  of  the entire recommendation to the Human Resources Command's Awards and  Decorations  Branch  upon  signature.  This  step  provides  the opportunity for administrative corrections to occur early in the process. Commanders  with  wartime  awards  approval  authority  will  report monthly to Human Resources Command with a rollup of all awards, including  all  valor  awards  awarded  by  subordinate  headquarters  if wartime award approval authority was delegated.

On 7 January 2016, the secretary of defense approved the creation of the C (for combat) and the R (for remote) devices. The creation of the C and R devices is the result of the DoD Military Decorations and Awards Review. The review found that some medals, such as valor awards, are inherently for combat service, while other medals are not so  distinct.  The  C  device  was  created  to  distinctly  recognize  those service members performing meritoriously under combat conditions, and the R device was created to recognize personal performance in remote service that directly impacts combat operations.

Human  Resources  Command,  in  March  2017,  issued  guidance on the awarding of these devices. Award of the devices is retroactive to the date when the secretary of defense approved their creation. To qualify for the C device, a soldier must be in an active area of combat where the soldier was personally exposed to hostile action or in an area where other soldiers were actively engaged. The R device is rated when  a  soldier's  actions  from  outside  the  operational  area  directly affect combat operations. The C and R devices will be awarded with the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit.

A  directive  from  the  secretary  of  defense  in  2016  required  the military departments, by the end of FY 2017, to review Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, and Silver Star nominations from  Operations enduring Freedom, iraqi Freedom, neW daWn, Freedom'S Sentinel , and inherent reSolve . The Army's review was a  three-phased  process.  Phase  I  consisted  of  an  internal  review  by the Human Resources Command's Awards and Decorations Board. Phase II consisted of a Special Army Awards and Decorations Board review.  Nominations  that  prompted  further  review  moved  to  Phase III for a Senior Army Decorations Board review. Of the 784 reviewed Distinguished Service Crosses and Silver Star nominations, the Senior Army Decorations Board recommended 23 for upgrade consideration: 10 Distinguished Service Crosses to Medal of Honor, and 13 Silver

Stars  upgraded  to  Distinguished  Service  Crosses.  Action  on  these recommendations will occur in FY 2018.

## Medal of Honor

On 31 July 2017, the president awarded former Specialist Fifth Class James C. McCloughan the Medal of Honor for his actions between 13-15 May 1969, serving as a medic in Company C, 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, 23d Infantry Division (Americal). During this engagement, roughly 2,000 enemy  soldiers  surrounded  McCloughan's  company.  Despite  multiple fragment and bullet wounds, Specialist McCloughan repeatedly risked his own life to save others. Over the course of forty-eight hours, he rescued ten American soldiers and tended to countless others.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Force Structure

The Program Objective Memorandum for Fiscal Years 2019/2023 incorporated recommendations made by the National Commission on the Future of the Army. The commission's report served as a blueprint and justification for much of the force structure growth initiated in FY 2017. One commission recommendation was making additional armored brigade combat teams available for deployment to Europe and the Republic of Korea. In November 2016, the Army announced  the  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  3d  Infantry  Division, would convert from an infantry brigade combat team to an armored brigade combat team. This conversion, expected to be completed in FY 2019, will increase the number of armored brigade combat teams to  fifteen-ten  in  the  Regular  Army  and  five  in  the  Army National Guard. In addition, provisions in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY 2019/2023 Program Objective Memorandum allowed the Army to begin planning the creation of a sixteenth armored brigade combat team, to be converted from an infantry brigade combat team.

In  February  2017,  the  Army  announced  plans  to  create  six security  force  assistance  brigades.  These  brigades  will  be  the Army's  first  permanent  unit  of  this  size  dedicated  to  advising and  assisting  partner  nations  in  developing  their  security  force capabilities.  For  more  than  ten  years,  brigade  combat  teams conducted  this  mission.  The  security  force  assistance  brigades will  relieve  the  brigade  combat  teams  and  permit  them  to  focus on combat-related tasks. The new units will also allow the Army to institutionalize the expertise gained since 2001 in advising and assisting partner nations. Early in FY 2018, the 1st Security Force Assistance  Brigade  will  be  activated  at  Fort  Benning,  Georgia. Additionally,  in  February  2017,  the  Army  announced  it  would establish a Military Advisor Training Academy at Fort Benning. The  U.S.  Army  Maneuver  Center  of  Excellence,  the  proponent for  brigade-level  security  force  assistance,  will  oversee  the  new

academy. The first six-week course at the academy is scheduled to begin early in FY 2018.

The  Army  established  readiness  enhancement  accounts  in  all three  components,  which  added  authorizations  in  specific  military occupation specialties to increase staffing and readiness levels. The specific specialties and grades are based on greatest need in brigade combat  teams  and,  therefore,  are  most  likely  to  improve  combat readiness. These authorizations are not linked to existing units and locations. Planners can recruit and resource using these authorizations in order to prevent hollow formations in critical units.

Because  of  the  increased  authorized  personnel  end  strength, a  number  of  units  scheduled  for  inactivation  were  retained  in  FY 2017,  including:  the  4th  Brigade  Combat  Team  (Airborne),  25th Infantry  Division,  at  Joint  Base  Elmendorf-Richardson,  Alaska; the  headquarters  of  the  18th  Military  Police  Brigade  in  Germany; the  206th  Military  Intelligence  Battalion  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas;  a maintenance  company;  and  a  combat  aviation  brigade  in  Korea. Additionally, the 166th Aviation Brigade, which was inactivated in 2015,  will  be  reactivated  at  Fort  Hood  in  FY  2018  to  train  Army Reserve and National Guard aviation units. The Army also began planning to station additional units overseas: a field artillery brigade headquarters  with  a  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System  (MLRS) battalion  and  accompanying  support  units,  two  MLRS  battalions with accompanying support units, a short-range air defense battalion, a theater movement control element, a petroleum support company, and an ammunition platoon. Finally, Training and Doctrine Command received an increase of 1,300 personnel spaces in order to mitigate personnel shortfalls in the training and recruiting base.

## Multi-Domain Battle

In October 2016, the Army announced it began developing the Multi-Domain Battle concept, which is intended to keep the service ahead of potential adversaries around the world. Since the end of the Cold War, American forces have enjoyed considerable freedom of action in the air, land, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains. However,  an  increasing  number  and  range  of  actors  are  capable of  denying  or  disrupting  American  forces'  access  to  and  action within air, maritime, space, and cyberspace domains from extended distances.  These  capabilities  threaten  American  forces'  ability  to achieve the military and political objectives assigned to them.

The  Multi-Domain  Battle  concept  evolved  out  of  the  Army operating concept published in 2014. It will be a joint-combined arms

concept that includes capabilities in the physical domains and places greater  emphasis  on  space,  cyberspace,  and  other  contested  areas such as the electromagnetic spectrum, the information environment, and  the  cognitive  dimension  of  warfare.  To  guide  development  of this concept, Training and Doctrine Command has pinpointed eight capabilities  on  which  to  concentrate:  cross-domain  fires,  combat vehicles, expeditionary mission command, advanced protection, cyber electromagnetic, future vertical lift, robotics/autonomous systems, and soldier  team  performance  and  overmatch.  In  early  2017,  the  Army and the U.S. Marine Corps issued a joint white paper on the MultiDomain Battle concept and established a joint task force to develop it. A publication outlining the concept is expected early in FY 2018.

## Cyber

The  development  of  a  capable  cyber  force  remained  critical  to the Army's long-term effort to build cyberspace capability. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory at Adelphi, Maryland, opened a Cyberresearch  Analytics  Laboratory.  It  provides  industrial  and  federally funded  partners  access  to  sensitive,  live  cybersecurity  data  in  order to  develop  strong  partnerships  with  U.S.  Army  Cyber  Command. The  Army  activated  the  National  Guard's  first  cyber  brigade,  the 91st Cyber Brigade, in Virginia. The new brigade serves as the higher headquarters for several National Guard cyber units on the east coast. In  addition,  the  Army  continued to integrate cyber soldiers into its regular formations. For example, cyber-electromagnetic activity teams were  part  of  the  Support  to  Corps  and  Below  initiative  during  a rotation of the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California.

## Training

During FY 2017, the Army initiated several new training efforts aimed  at  building  and  maintaining  unit  readiness.  More  brigade combat teams (including National Guard brigades) completed rotations at combat training centers. In 2016, the Army ran eighteen rotations  at  combat  training  centers  at  Fort  Irwin,  California;  Fort Polk,  Louisiana;  and  Hohenfels,  Germany.  In  2017,  nineteen  were planned and by 2020 the Army hoped to increase rotations to twenty per year.

One notable training exercise conducted during FY 2017 involved a  rare  convoy  of  more  than  1,200  vehicles,  including  325  Stryker armored vehicles, and 5,750 soldiers of the 1st Brigade Combat Team,

4th Infantry Division. As part of an exercise dubbed Operation raider FocuS ,  the convoy traveled from their home station of Fort Carson, Colorado,  to  Piñon  Canyon  Maneuver  Site.  Typically,  the  division conducted the 140-mile trip by rail, but the unit's leaders wanted to test the brigade's equipment and capabilities. Preparations for the trek took nearly a year. At the completion of the two-week exercise, the brigade returned by road to Fort Carson.

The Army's first gender-integrated infantry one station unit training class started in February 2017 with 149 male and 32 female recruits. The class graduated in May with 115 male and 18 female soldiers.

In  October  2016,  the  Army  published  Field  Manual  7-0, Train to  Win  in  a  Complex  World .  A  digital-only  publication,  the  manual explains training strategies and new initiatives for assessing training readiness.  Embedded  in  the  manual  are  links  to  Army  Training Network resources such as instructional videos, mission-essential task lists, training and evaluation outlines, and best training practices. The new manual reflects the Army's transition from preparing units for a specific  mission  in  Iraq  or  Afghanistan  to  preparing  for  a  range  of contingencies. It also makes training proficiency ratings more specific and  more  objective.  The  old  proficiency  ratings  of  T  (trained),  P (needs practice), and U (untrained) have been replaced with T (fully trained), T- (trained), P (practiced), P- (marginally practiced), and U (untrained). The change is designed to give leaders a more accurate picture of their unit's readiness.

In  April  2017,  Army  Techniques  Publication  3-01.81, CounterUnmanned  Aircraft  System  Techniques , was  released.  It  provides planning considerations for defending against low, slow, small unmanned air threats during operations. The publication also provides guidance  on  how  to  plan  for  and  incorporate  counter-unmanned aircraft system tactics, techniques, and procedures into unit training. Additionally,  trainers  and  educators  will  use  this  publication  in developing and presenting instruction on combined arms air defense.

Incorporating cyberspace electromagnetic activities throughout all  phases  of  an  operation  is  key  to  obtaining  and  maintaining freedom  of  maneuver  in  cyberspace  and  the  electromagnetic spectrum, while denying the same to adversaries. In April 2017, the Army updated its doctrine on these activities with publication of Field Manual 3-12, Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations . The manual provides tactics and procedures for the coordination and integration of Army cyberspace and electronic warfare operations to  support  unified  land  operations  and  joint  operations.  Because of  the  rapidly  evolving  cyberspace  domain,  the  Cyber  Center  of Excellence intends to review and update the manual and supporting

publications on a frequent basis to keep pace with a continuously evolving cyberspace domain.

## Operational Forces

In FY 2017, the service continued a program to rotate combat units from the continental United States to Europe. At the end of the fiscal year, the Army had nearly 30,000 personnel stationed in Europe, with 21,331 soldiers in Germany. Italy had the second largest total with 4,302 personnel, mostly associated with the 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team  stationed  in  Vicenza.  In  Belgium,  586  personnel  supported NATO headquarters, and the Army had 219 soldiers assigned in the United Kingdom. Additionally, 657 personnel supported the Kosovo Force peacekeeping operations.

The Army had nearly 20,000 soldiers stationed in East Asia and the Pacific at the end of the fiscal year. Of these, the United States had 2,704 soldiers stationed in Japan, either at Camp Zama outside of Tokyo or on Okinawa. The Army stationed 44 personnel in Thailand to help coordinate training exercises between the Royal Thai Armed Forces and the United States. There were 15,558 soldiers stationed in the Republic of Korea.

In the western hemisphere, the Army had 131 soldiers assigned to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 215 personnel in Honduras, and  26  in  Columbia.  The  majority  of  countries  in  the  western hemisphere had very small numbers of Army personnel, usually less than three, assigned to embassy staff elements.

## Afghanistan

Operation Freedom'S Sentinel in Afghanistan continued to require significant  Army  support  during  FY  2017.  In  September  2016,  the number of personnel deployed to Afghanistan was 6,846 Regular Army, 609 mobilized Army National Guard, and 677 mobilized Army Reserve personnel. By the end of September 2017, that number had increased to 9,371 Regular Army, 799 mobilized Army National Guard, and 620 mobilized  Army  Reserve.  Army  casualties  for  Operation Freedom'S Sentinel during FY 2017 were eighteen killed and ninety-eight wounded.

American forces in Afghanistan during FY 2017 had two missions: a counterterrorism mission against the remnants of al-Qaeda and a train, advise, and assist mission supporting Afghan security forces. During  FY  2017,  the  Army  maintained  elements  of  two  division headquarters in Afghanistan. The 1st Cavalry Division headquarters remained  in  country  until  August  2017  when  the  3d  Infantry

Division headquarters replaced it and assumed its mission of serving as  the  U.S.  Forces-Afghanistan's  National  Support  Element.  The deployment of an element of the 36th Infantry Division headquarters in June 2016 to serve as the Train Advise Assist Command-South marked a historical moment, as it was the first such National Guard division headquarters to assume such a mission. Responsibility for this  mission  remained  with  the  36th  Infantry  Division  during  FY 2017 when a second headquarters element from that unit arrived in Afghanistan in March 2017.

In  addition,  five  augmented  brigade  combat  teams  served  in Afghanistan during the fiscal year to conduct security force assistance operations.  The  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  4th  Infantry  Division, remained  in  Afghanistan  until  November  2016.  The  3d  Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, deployed from October 2016 until July 2017. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, a Stryker brigade combat team, served from January to October 2017. Finally, in July and September 2017 the Army deployed two airborne brigade combat teams to Afghanistan: the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82d  Airborne  Division,  and  the  4th  Brigade  Combat  Team,  25th Infantry Division. When the Army announced both deployments in April 2017, they were to consist of a regular rotation of approximately 1,500 soldiers. However, on 21 August 2017, President Donald J. Trump announced a surge of an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan to bolster the Afghan government forces amidst a deteriorating security situation. As a result, by September both brigades had deployed more than 2,000 soldiers each to Afghanistan.

## Southwest Asia

During FY 2017, the Army remained heavily committed in U.S. Army  Central's  Southwest  Asia  region,  especially  in  Iraq,  Syria, and Kuwait. The Army began the fiscal year with more than 15,000 soldiers deployed to the region. By the end of FY 2017, that number increased to nearly 22,000. The most significant operations occurred in the continuing fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)  as  part  of  Operation inherent  reSolve .  In  addition,  the Army maintained forces with theaterwide responsibilities as part of Operation Spartan Shield .

The most direct threat to Iraq remained ISIS. Operation inherent reSolve began  in  June  2014,  in  conjunction  with  coalition  and partner forces, to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and set conditions for  follow-on  operations  to  increase  regional  stability.  The  Army primarily  provided  command-and-control,  fires,  logistical  support,

and security force assistance. During FY 2017, the major objective in Iraq involved the liberation of the northern city of Mosul. Operations to  retake  the  city  began  on  16  October  2016,  and  by  24  January 2017, Iraqi security forces had cleared the portions of the city east of the Tigris River. Coalition forces launched operations to secure the western part of the city on 19 February 2017, and secured it by the end of July. The subsequent liberation of Tal Afar and northern Ninawa Province from 20-31 August 2017 effectively ended ISIS's presence in northern Iraq.

Concurrent with the operations in Iraq, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, with i nherent reSolve coalition support, captured Raqqa, where ISIS had located its capital. Coalition forces spent the first half of the year isolating the city. As part of the operation, an air assault behind enemy lines used American helicopters to transport 500 local troops and coalition military advisers across the Euphrates River and Lake Assad to capture the town of Tabqa and the nearby Tabqa Dam. The assault on Raqqa began on 6 June 2017 and was expected to be concluded in early FY 2018.

During  FY  2017,  the  Army  maintained  a  corps  headquarters, division headquarters, and a brigade combat team in the region as part of Operation inherent reSolve . In September 2017, the III Corps assumed authority of Combined Joint Task Force-Operation inherent reSolve from the XVIII Airborne Corps. In November 2016, the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division relinquished command of the Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Iraq (CJFLCC-I) to the 1st

Infantry Division headquarters. During its nine-month tour commanding CJFLCC-I, the division headquarters was responsible for the command and control of the coalition troops as they trained, advised, assisted, and provided critical capabilities to the Iraqi security forces. In July 2017, the 1st Infantry Division passed command of CJFLCC-I to the headquarters of  the  1st  Armored  Division.  The  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  82d Airborne Division, deployed to Iraq in January 2017. It replaced the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, as the lead element for the CJFLCC-I's advise and assist mission.

The Army also maintained a division headquarters and an armored brigade combat team in Kuwait to support theaterwide commitments as part of Operation Spartan Shield . In December 2016, the National Guard's  29th  Infantry  Division  headquarters  deployed  to  Kuwait, becoming the first National Guard division to assume such a mission. The 29th Infantry Division relinquished command to the headquarters of the National Guard's 35th Infantry Division in July 2017. The 3d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, passed off its role as the theater armored brigade combat team in March 2017 to the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.

Strength in Iraq on 30 September 2016 was 3,080 Regular Army, 259  mobilized  Army  National  Guard,  and  401  mobilized  Army

Reserve.  By  30  September  2017,  Army  personnel  strength  in  Iraq had increased to 4,918 Regular Army, 763 mobilized Army National Guard, and 533 mobilized Army Reserve. Other areas of U.S. Central Command, particularly logistics and transportation hubs, continued to require Army personnel. In particular, total personnel deployed to  Kuwait  increased  from  8,591  on  30  September  2016  to  10,816 by 30 September 2017. Army casualties for FY 2017 in Operation inherent reSolve were thirteen killed and twenty-two wounded.

## U.S. Army South

U.S. Army  South  is  responsible for Army  operations  in Central  and  South  America  and  the  Caribbean.  Approximately 4,000 soldiers supported military operations in these areas during FY  2017.  They  conducted  security cooperation, contingency operations,  and  fulfilled  requirements  for  Title  10  support  and regional support missions for the Department of the Army and the U.S.  Southern  Command.  The  command  maintained  the  Army's regional partnership programs and provided humanitarian disaster relief throughout the region.

Exercises in FY 2017 included: beyond the horizon, panamax , medical  readiness  exercises, tradeWindS ,  and FuerzaS  aliadaS humanitariaS . In  February  2016,  the  Army  assumed  the  twoyear  leadership  role  for  the  Conference  of  American  Armies.  As part of the conference's schedule of events, U.S. Army South and partner nations focused on four core military imperatives: respect for  human  rights,  gender  integration,  professionalization  of  the noncommissioned  officer  corps,  and  improving  joint  capability. Missions  of  Joint  Task  Forcebravo , stationed  at  Soto  Cano Air  Base,  Honduras,  and  its  primary  unit,  the  1st  Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, included helicopter support to counter organized  crime,  medical  readiness  training,  and  disaster-relief support.  During  the  year,  the  525th  Military  Police  Battalion and rotational military police units from the reserve components supported Joint Task Forceguantanamo .

## U.S. Army Africa

During  FY  2017,  the  Army  greatly  expanded  its  presence  in Africa in response to growing threats from extremist groups with ties  to  al-Qaeda  and  ISIS.  Army  forces  participated  in  numerous training  exercises  for  security  cooperation  logistics,  peacekeeping operations,  and  infantry  training.  The  U.S.  Africa  Command

renamed  and  expanded  the accord series  of  exercises  to  reflect a  shift  from  regional  training  to  training  focused  on  improving operational  and  strategic  conditions  across  the  continent.  The eaStern,  central ,  and Southern  accord exercises  became  the JuStiFied , united , and Shared accord exercises. Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Africa hosted these exercises, respectively. U.S. Africa Command also added the new uniFied FocuS exercise in Cameroon. All  four  of  these  exercises  consisted  of  tabletop,  command  post, or  field  training.  Army  special  operations  units  took  part  in  the Flintlock exercise in Niger and medical personnel participated in four medical readiness training exercises in Senegal, Ghana, Chad, and Gabon. The Army also rotated units to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti  to  serve  with  the  Combined  Joint  Task  Forcehorn oF aFrica and East Africa Response Force.

During  FY  2017,  the  Army  had  approximately  2,000  soldiers deployed  to  Africa  at  any  given  time.  In  October  2016,  the  1st Brigade  Combat  Team,  101st  Airborne  Division,  replaced  the  2d Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, as the Army's brigade regionally  aligned  to  Africa.  Elements  from  the  latter  unit  rotated to the continent throughout the year. The 3d Special Forces Group realigned to Africa in 2017, the group's historical area of operation. U.S. Army Africa also continued its efforts to establish its own fulltime theater sustainment capability. Previously, it had relied on the 21st  Sustainment  Command  in  Germany.  In  FY  2016,  the  Army tapped the 79th Sustainment Command, an Army Reserve unit, to provide this capability by FY 2018. Until that time, the Army assigned a Regular Army expeditionary sustainment command to the theater. The 13th Sustainment Command from Fort Hood began operating under the operational control of U.S. Army Africa in early FY 2017.

## Asia Pacific

During FY 2017, U.S. Army Pacific continued its ongoing regional training and readiness building activities. Chief among these was the paciFic pathWayS initiative. Launched in 2014, it combined multiple preexisting exercises with partner nations into integrated operations. paciFic  pathWayS began  as  a  rehearsal  for  deployments  across  the theater. By FY 2017, it expanded into three- or four-month deployments of brigades, which helped improve their readiness and the readiness of partner nation forces. The training exercises also provided the Army with an opportunity to test Multi-Domain Battle concepts. Among the exercises that were part of paciFic pathWayS were: cobra gold and hanuman guardian with Thailand; Foal eagle with South Korea;

balikatan with  the  Philippines; garuda  Shield with  Indonesia; and keriS  Strike with  Malaysia.  U.S.  Army  Pacific  also  hosted  a number  of  new  'reverse' paciFic  pathWayS ,  whereby  soldiers  from partner nations traveled to the United States to participate in training exercises. For example, Singapore service members traveled to Hawaii to participate in the tiger balm exercise, the Canadian military took part in arctic anvil in Alaska, and the Japanese military joined the riSing thunder exercise in Washington State.

In 2004, the United States and the Republic of Korea agreed to move all American forces to garrisons south of the Han River, most of which would be relocated to Camp Humphreys, about forty miles south of Seoul on the peninsula's west coast. During FY 2017, the relocation effort continued with construction of new facilities at Camp Humphreys  and  the  installation's  expansion  from  1,041  to  3,453 acres. Army units began relocating to Camp Humphreys in FY 2017, including Eighth Army headquarters.

In July 2016, the DoD announced the United States and South Korea had reached an agreement to station a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile battery in Korea. The battery

contributed to the layered missile defense system that protected South Korea from North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile threats. In March and April 2017, Battery D, 2d Air Defense Artillery Regiment, from Fort Bliss, Texas, began deploying the first elements of its THAAD system to South Korea. After achieving initial operating capability, Battery A, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, also  from  Fort  Bliss,  temporarily  assumed  responsibility  for  the THAAD mission in South Korea. This allowed Battery D to return to the United States and prepare for its permanent return to South Korea in early FY 2018 to reassume the THAAD mission.

During FY 2017, the Army had more than 71,000 soldiers in the Indo-Asia  Pacific  region  to  counter  the  myriad  security  challenges from regional adversaries, violent extremist organizations, and natural disasters.  The  Army also continued its program of rotating combat forces  to  South  Korea  for  nine-month  deployments.  These  forces supplemented  combat  formations  permanently  stationed  on  the peninsula. Rotation of armored brigade combat teams began in June 2015. In October 2016, the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, from Fort Riley, Kansas, replaced the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. The 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, from Fort Hood assumed responsibility in July 2017.

The Army was also rotating aviation and MLRS units to South Korea  since  October  2013  and  May  2015,  respectively.  In  January 2017, the 1st Infantry Division's 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, equipped  with  the  AH-64D  Longbow  Apache  attack  helicopter, deployed from Fort Riley to replace the 82d Airborne Division's 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, which was the last Army aviation unit  equipped  with  the  OH-58D  Kiowa  Warrior  scout  helicopter. In  September  2017,  members  of  the  10th  Mountain  Division's  6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, from Fort Drum, New York, began deploying  to  Korea  to  assume  this  rotational  mission.  In  October 2016,  the  rotation  of  MLRS  battalions  from  Fort  Sill,  Oklahoma, continued. The 2d Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Regiment, replaced the 3d Battalion, 13th Field Artillery. In June 2017, the 2d Battalion, 4th Field Artillery Regiment, assumed this mission.

## U.S. Army Europe

U.S.  Army  Europe  Operation atlantic  reSolve continued  to demonstrate America's commitment to collective security in Europe. During FY 2017, the Army began to rebuild its presence in Europe to reassure allies and deter Russia. First, the Army launched a program of nine-month force rotation from the United States to Europe. These

forces included an armored brigade combat team, a combat aviation brigade, and support units. The units participated in numerous exercises in Eastern Europe with allied forces. Units deployed to Europe with their full complement of vehicles and equipment instead of utilizing pre-positioned  activity  sets. This  helped  the  units'  readiness  by providing them with hands-on experience deploying an entire brigade worth of equipment.

During FY 2017, the Army contributed some 34,000 soldiers in support  of  United  States  European  Command.  In  addition  to  the primary Army forces permanently stationed in Europe, the 2d Cavalry Regiment and the 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team, regionally aligned  and  rotational  forces  supported  missions  in  Europe.  The headquarters  of  the  4th  Infantry  Division  continued  to  supply  a mission command element to oversee rotational units and provide a division-level command and control capability.

The  first  rotational  units  from  the  United  States  also  began arriving  in  FY  2017.  Previously,  the  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  3d Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, Georgia, provided units for short rotations to participate in multinational exercises in Europe. In January 2017, the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, deployed from Fort Carson, Colorado. The brigade achieved a 'ready to fight' status two weeks after arrival. During its nine-month deployment, the brigade's headquarters operated out of Poland, while its subordinate

units conducted exercises in the Baltic republics, Romania, Bulgaria, and Germany.

In March 2017, the first brigade-sized aviation unit deployed to Europe  as  part  of  Operation atlantic  reSolve .  This  nine-month deployment  fulfilled  the  requirement  for  additional  aviation  assets in Europe, which had existed since FY 2015 when the Army reduced the  Germany-based  12th  Combat  Aviation  Brigade  from  seven  to two battalions  as  part  of  the  Aviation  Restructuring  Initiative.  The deployment  consisted  of  the  brigade-sized  Task  Force Falcon , composed  of  the  10th  Combat  Aviation  Brigade,  10th  Mountain Division,  from  Fort  Drum  and  the  1st  Battalion,  501st  Aviation Regiment, from Fort Bliss. The task force positioned the majority of its units in Germany, with forward presences in Latvia, Romania, and Poland. Task Force Falcon replaced the battalion-sized Task Force apocalypSe , which had deployed to Europe in June 2016 to reinforce the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade.

## Organizational Structure

In  FY  2017,  the  Army  National  Guard  (ARNG)  comprised 34  percent  of  the  Army's  overall  operational  force.  There  were thirteen ARNG major commands: eight divisions, two sustainment command (expeditionary), one air and missile defense command, one  military  police  command,  and  one  theater  sustainment.  The ARNG troop unit list included two special forces groups, twentysix brigade  combat  teams,  forty-three  multifunctional  support brigades,  and  fifty-four  functional  support  brigades  and  groups. The Army Reserve provides 78 percent of the Army's sustainment

capabilities, almost half its total maneuver support, and a quarter of its mobilization base-expansion capacity.

## Reserve Component Mobilization

In FY 2017, mobilization of ARNG and Army Reserve personnel remained an important asset for meeting the demand from combatant commands for Army capabilities ( Tables 8 and 9 ).

## Readiness

A key readiness indicator is Equipment on Hand (EOH). In FY 2017, the ARNG had 94 percent of its required equipment, up from 93 percent in FY 2016. Additionally, for critical dual-use equipmentthose items deemed necessary for both state and federal missions-the on-hand level was 89 percent, unchanged from FY 2016. The Army Reserve's  EOH,  excluding  legacy  substitute  items  (items  handed down from the active component), was 82 percent for FY 2017. When including  substitutes,  EOH  was  92  percent.  The  higher  EOH  with substitute  items  represents  the  post-Budget  Control  Act  trend  of reduced new procurement funding and increased reliance on Regular Army legacy equipment to fill Army Reserve shortages. This approach places  less-capable  equipment  in  Army  Reserve  formations,  widens compatibility  gaps  with  the  other  two  components,  and  diminishes those units' ability to meet minimum standards for deployment.

During  FY  2017,  the  ARNG  continued  to  implement  ARNG 4.0.  In  FY 2016, the Department of the Army directed the ARNG to  rapidly  provide  increased  combat  and  enabling  capabilities  to decrease risk in meeting operational plans and emerging contingency requirements. In response to this directive, the ARNG began ARNG 4.0 in September 2016. This designation reflects the fourth phase of the ARNG's development since the end of the Vietnam War, becoming an operational reserve force instead of a strategic reserve force.

ARNG  4.0  includes  multiple  initiatives. The  ARNG  will transition  from  a  five-year  training  cycle  to  a  four-year  cycle. It  will  enhance  readiness  in  capabilities  such  as  air  and  missile defense; fires, armor and Stryker brigade combat teams; and attack reconnaissance  battalions.  Four  combat  training  center  rotations a  year  will  be  conducted  to  produce  four  brigade  combat  teams at  company-level  proficiency.  Personnel  strength  in  priority  units will be increased to achieve 95 percent availability for deployment. Phase  one  of  ARNG  4.0  will  concentrate  on  building  enhanced

levels  of  readiness  in  armor  and  Stryker  brigade  combat  teams, selected  infantry  brigades,  nondivisional  field  artillery  units,  and attack reconnaissance battalions. The number of increased training days over the current thirty-nine days will vary depending on the unit,  with  the  objective  of  reducing  postmobilization  training requirements. Phase two will focus on increasing readiness of the remaining force.

The Associated Units Pilot Program began in FY 2016 as part of ARNG 4.0. It is a three-year test of a new concept to increase readiness  and  responsiveness  of  the  Army  as  a  total  force.  The program  uses  the  secretary  of  the  Army's  authority  to  associate units of the Army Reserve and ARNG with Regular Army units for training oversight prior to mobilization. When the secretary of the Army designates associated units, the association relationship modifies  administrative  control.  The  gaining  unit  commander becomes  responsible  for  approving  the  associated  unit's  training program,  reviewing  its  readiness  report,  assessing  its  resource requirements,  and  confirming  collective  proficiency.  Association also facilitates units from different components training together. Another  key  element  of  the  pilot  program  is  the  exchange  of personnel between the units-associated units will exchange a small number of officers and noncommissioned officers.

In  addition  to  training  with  Regular  Army  units,  reserve component  units  selected  for  the  pilot  are  provided  additional resources  to  sustain  higher  readiness.  They  have  up  to  fifteen additional days of training each year, and more frequent rotations at combat training centers or other capstone training events based on their type of unit. Regular and reserve component units in an associated relationship will be staffed to ensure sufficient personnel execute  the  training  strategy,  exchange  assigned  personnel  to enhance mutual understanding across components, as well as wear common patches. Associated units will not be required to maintain the exact same modernization levels, but they must be compatible to ensure they can train and fight together ( Table 10 ).

The Army Reserve's Ready Force X program, launched in 2016, continued during FY 2017. The goal of Ready Force X is to build a  force  of  selected  units  capable  of  deploying  on  short  notice, rather than building readiness for predictable overseas rotations as had been done for the past fifteen years. Units with high-demand capabilities  are  identified  to  create  a  pool  of  soldiers  who  can deploy rapidly, some with as little as thirty days' notice. Examples of these capabilities include petroleum distribution, rail operations,

As  part  of  the  Ready  Force  X  initiative,  during  FY  2017, approximately 1,800 soldiers from approximately sixty Army Reserve units participated in Operation cold Steel .  Hosted by the 84th Training Command, the operation's purpose was to create more combat-ready units by training and qualifying soldiers on crew-served weapons during rotations lasting twelve days. Operation cold Steel was a successful proof  of  principle,  with  a  qualification  rate  of  93  percent.  A  larger operation, cold Steel II, will be conducted in FY 2018.

## State Partnership Program

In  FY  2017,  the  ARNG  continued  to  provide  outreach  and training  to  other  nation's  forces  as  part  of  the  State  Partnership Program.  The  program  is  a  Department  of  Defense  security cooperation program, managed and administered by the National Guard  Bureau,  executed  and  coordinated  by  the geographic combatant  commands,  with  personnel  provided  by  the  National Guard of the respective partner states. Units are linked directly with

foreign  military  units  to  develop  long-term  relationships.  Guard units  took  part  in  maneuver-  and  combat-related  tasks;  security; disaster  response  and  mitigation;  crisis  management;  interagency cooperation;  border,  port,  and  aviation  security;  fellowship-style internships; and combat medical training. In FY 2017, there were seventy-five partnerships, up from seventy in FY 2016, covering all six geographic combatant commands.

## Hurricane Response

During the 2017 hurricane season (which extended into the first two months of FY 2018), the ARNG deployed units to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands in response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. By the end of FY 2017, more than 13,000 ARNG personnel  were  employed  in  support  of  Hurricane  Harvey  relief

efforts, approximately 8,700 for Hurricane Irma, and more than 2,900 for Hurricane Maria.

Also during that period, 2,253 Army Reserve Soldiers-mobilized from forty units-conducted response operations. Under Immediate Response  Authority,  which  allows  the  Army  Reserve  to  directly respond to requests from civil authorities when time does not permit approval  from  a  higher  authority,  Army  Reserve  soldiers  provided hurricane support  after Hurricane  Harvey.  They  also  provided immediate response in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which  included  transportation  support  for  port  assessments,  road clearance, and command and control teams. Units stationed in Puerto Rico  provided  capabilities  required  to  move  commodities,  support mortuary affairs, restore power, and open roadways.



## Initiatives

A  major  logistics  effort  during  FY  2017  was  the  expansion  of Army Pre-positioned  Stocks  (APS).  These  are  stores  of  equipment housed either afloat or ashore for rapid response use in a contingency operation.  To  better  support  a  long-term  deterrence  presence  in Europe, in December 2015, the deputy secretary of defense directed the Army to establish an APS in support of U.S. European Command. The Army previously had established equipment for one brigade to use while deployed as part of Operation atlantic reSolve , a collection known as the European Activity Set. The Department of the Army published the execution order establishing APS-2 unit requirements in May 2016. U.S. Army Europe worked to obtain sites in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. U.S. Army Europe also developed a European Activity Set timeline for equipment turn-in so these items could  become  a  unit  set  in  APS-2.  In  December  2016,  an  APS-2

facility  housing  an  armored  brigade  combat  team  equipment  set opened in Eygelshoven, Netherlands. APS-2 is planned to have enough equipment by the end of FY 2020 for a reduced-strength division.

During  FY  2017,  the  Army  Staff's  G-4  revised  several  Army Regulations (ARs). AR 735-5, Property Accountability Policies ,  was published in November 2016 and AR 702-6, Ammunition Stockpile Reliability Program , in December 2016. Released in March 2017 were AR  700-4, Logistics  Assistance ; AR  715-9, Operational  Contract Support  Planning  and  Management ;  AR  740-26, Physical  Inventory Control ; and AR 700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program . AR 711-6, Army Participation in the Defense Logistics Agency Weapons System Support Program , was published in July 2017, and AR 750-1, Army Materiel Maintenance Policy , in August 2017.

As  part  of  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  brigade  combat  team strength  to  increase  firepower  and  readiness,  logisticians  worked to  improve  property  accountability  at  the  brigade  level.  More  than 178,000  pieces  of  equipment  were  redistributed,  and  the  Army divested  441,000  excess  pieces  of  equipment  worth  more  than  $7.5 billion. Reducing the inventory of unneeded equipment will save the service more than $40 million annually in storage costs. Divesture of equipment achieves two objectives. It frees up material for units that have unfulfilled requirements, which improves their readiness, and it helps units with excesses become more mobile and deployable.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

In FY 2017, the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) began conducting a two-part approach to help both the Army and industry  prioritize  future  force  development  efforts.  First,  ARCIC introduced the Forum for Innovative Novel Discovery in October 2016. Its purpose is to provide small businesses with an opportunity to present their most innovative projects or ideas to key senior Army leaders and receive immediate feedback to refine technological solutions. The goal is  to  develop  opportunities  to  discover  potentially  game-changing technologies  through  a  novel  approach  with  the  industry.  Second, ARCIC established the Capabilities Information Exchange (CIE). The CIE is a much broader forum than the Forum for Innovative Novel Discovery, open to all interested members of industry, and provides an opportunity to participate in one-on-one sessions with government subject matter experts and ask questions about the needs of Army's future force. The first CIE was held in December 2016. Both events will  be  held  semiannually  and  will  address  the  key  capabilities  that Training and Doctrine Command identified in FY 2016 as essential for

the Army to achieve tactical and operational overmatch in the future operating  environment.  These  capabilities  are  overmatch  in  soldier and team performance; future vertical lift; robotic and autonomous systems; mission command, cyber, and electronic warfare; advanced protection; combat vehicles; and cross-domain fires.

The  FY  2016  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  directed  a comprehensive assessment of the current and future capabilities and requirements of the Army's mobile tactical communications and data networks.  The  Institute  for  Defense  Analysis  (IDA)  conducted  this assessment. At the same time, the Army conducted an assessment of its network and modernization plans in all four network mission areasthe  enterprise  information  environment  mission  area,  intelligence mission  area,  business  mission  area,  and  the  war  fighting  mission area.  The  Army's  assessment  found  the  current  network  had  been conceived, developed, and fielded for the static environments of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is too complex and fragile, not sufficiently mobile or expeditionary, and will not survive against current and future peer threats,  or  in  contested  environments.  Also,  it  is  not  user-friendly, intuitive, or flexible enough to support the Army's missions in the most effective manner and demands a heavy reliance on industry field service representatives to operate and sustain these systems. The IDA study, as well as feedback from Department of Defense testing agencies, combat training center rotations, and operational commanders, corroborated these findings.

As a result of these findings, the Army in FY 2017 adopted a new network  modernization  concept.  It  will  halt  programs  that  do  not remedy  operational  shortfalls,  fix  those  programs  required  to  'fight tonight,' and then pivot to a new acquisition strategy of 'adapt and buy'  that  allows  for  rapid  insertion  of  new  technologies.  Under  this concept, in FY 2018, the Army will halt procurement of the Mid-Tier Network Vehicular Radio and the Command Post of the Future. It will also  halt  procurement  of  War  fighter  Information  Network-Tactical (WIN-T)  Increment  2,  although  the  WIN-T  Increment  2  Tactical Communications Node-Lite and Network Operations Security CenterLite will be fielded to infantry brigade combat teams, and fielding of WIN-T Increment 2 to Stryker brigade combat teams will be completed. Increment 2 will not be fielded to armored brigade combat teams. This approach allows the Army to reinvest $544.9 million to fix the network's most pressing interoperability and security concerns, and to adapt and buy better systems.

To mitigate oversight-related risk identified in the IDA study, the Army will provide clear governance and unity of command by establishing a senior review group, the Information Technology Oversight

Council, cochaired by the under secretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff. This council will integrate activities and assessments across all four network mission areas, provide guidance and direction, prioritize investments, and allocate resources. To improve horizontal  integration,  the  Army  will  establish  cross  functional  teams supporting  integrated  requirements  and  focused  procurement.  To improve standards and architecture governance, the Army Chief Information Officer/G-6 was designated the lead integrator for Army information technology integration and governance.

The  Joint  Light  Tactical  Vehicle  (JLTV),  a  family  of  tactical wheeled  vehicles  and  companion  trailers,  will  replace  the  Army's fleet  of  High  Mobility  Multipurpose  Wheeled  Vehicles.  The  JLTV will have better armor and mobility, and is also built on a V-shaped hull, which is designed to deflect the blast of explosions away from the crew cabin. The Army received the first delivery of production JLTVs in October 2016. This initial order included 657 JLTVs and 25 trailers. The Army Test and Evaluation Command began Reliability Qualification Testing of the vehicle in January 2017. The Army plans to  begin  fielding  the  JLTV  with  units  in  2019,  with  an  approved acquisition objective of 54,599 vehicles.

The Armored Multipurpose Vehicle will replace the M113 armored personnel  carrier  in  a  variety  of  mission  roles,  including  general purpose transport, command and control, mortar carrier, and medevac treatment. Design guidelines specify improved armor protection and increased mobility over that of the M113, and significant improvements in  the  communications,  tracking,  and  networking  technologies.  The

Patriot  is  a  mobile  air  and  missile  defense  system  that  counters missile and aircraft threats. During FY 2017, the Army continued the initial operational test and evaluation program for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Post Deployment Build-8. This program included live fire tests against ballistic and cruise missiles. Patriot successfully engaged all  targets.  The  testing  did  show  training  remained  inadequate  to prepare operators for complex Patriot engagements and the system did have some classified effectiveness shortfalls. The initial operational test and evaluation program will continue into FY 2018.

In October 2016, the Army G-8 issued a requirement to procure, as a nondevelopmental item, and field by FY 2020, an active protection system. This procurement will provide a sufficient system for the Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles for one armored brigade combat team stored at an active protection system site in Europe as well as one Stryker battalion task force. This requirement supports the european deterrence  initiative . The  active  protection  system  will  improve the  survivability  of  combat  vehicles  against  antitank-guided  missiles, rocket-propelled grenades, and recoilless-rifle threats. The system will use  kinetic  options  to  intercept  and  disrupt  or  defeat  the  incoming warhead. In February 2017, the Army Acquisition Executive authorized expedited  assessment  of  three  existing  systems  to  assess  maturity, performance,  and  integration  risk.  Selected  for  assessment  were  the Trophy system for Army M1A2 and Marine Corps M1A1 tanks, the Iron Fist system for Bradley vehicles, and the Iron Curtain system for Stryker vehicles. The Army divided active protection system testing into three phases. Phase one, the characterization phase, will determine the system's fundamental performance and limitations, and provide data on the effects of installing the system on the vehicle. Phase two, the urgent material  release  phase,  will  test  the  production  representative  active protection  system  installed  on  operationally  representative  vehicles under realistic combat conditions. Phase three, the program of record phase, will assess the effectiveness, suitability, and survivability of the vehicle equipped with a production representative system under realistic combat  conditions  against  the  spectrum  of  operationally  relevant threats. The Army completed phase one Trophy testing in September 2017. Phase one Iron Curtain and Iron Fist testing continued into FY 2018. Phase two is expected to begin in January 2018. The start of phase three has not yet been determined.

The  Army  began  the  Paladin  Integrated  Management  Initial Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  (IOT&amp;E)  in  October  2016.  The M109A7  Paladin self-propelled howitzer and M992A3  Carrier

Ammunition  Tracked  will  replace  the  current  M109A6  Paladin and  M992A2  Field  Artillery  Ammunition  Supply  Vehicle.  This modernization  program  will  improve  size,  weight,  power,  cooling, readiness, force protection, and survivability. The IOT&amp;E  was suspended  after  toxic  fumes  released  in  the  M109A7  cab  affected twenty-eight  soldiers.  Analysis  indicated  the  fumes  were  related  to problems  with  the  cannon  breech.  After  developing  measures  to address the problems with cannon breech reliability, a second IOT&amp;E will be conducted in March 2018.

The Program Executive Office Soldier released the final solicitation for the Modular Handgun System to industry in August 2015. This weapon will replace the M9 pistol. Vendors submitted nine proposal submissions.  The  Army  selected  the  submission  from  SIG  Sauer: a variant of the company's P320 handgun. It awarded the company a  production  contract  in  January  2017  for  both  the  XM17  full-size variant  and  XM18  compact  variant  pistols.  Another  vendor  filed  a protest with the Government Accountability Office in February 2017, but the latter denied the challenge. The Army conducted operational and live fire testing for both variants in FY 2017. Analysis is ongoing

of  these  weapons'  operational  effectiveness,  operational  suitability, and lethality.

In September 2017, the Army awarded a contract for the Maneuver Support Vessel (Light) engineering and manufacturing development phase and subsequent production and deployment phase. The Maneuver  Support  Vessel  (Light)  will  replace  the  Army's  fleet  of Vietnam-era Landing Craft Mechanized-8 boats. The new vessel will be able to transport far larger loads than its predecessor, such as one M1A2 Abrams tank or four Joint Light Tactical Vehicles with trailers. It will have a top speed of 18 knots, 15 knots when fully loaded, and a range of about 350 miles. Over the next four years, the Army will work with the contractor as it produces a full-scale prototype for additional evaluation.  A  Milestone  C  decision  and  authorization  for  low-rate initial production of the first four vessels is scheduled for the end of FY 2021, followed by a full-rate production decision in FY 2023. The Army intends to acquire thirty-six vessels.

Additive manufacturing, also known  as  3-D  printing, is a technology that builds successive layers of materials to create a threedimensional object. The Army plans to use this technology to improve readiness  by  repairing  or  producing  spare  parts  or  by  creating  new

parts in real-time as close to the point of need as possible. U.S. Army Research,  Development  and  Engineering  Command  is  developing additive  manufacturing  in  three  phases.  Phase  one  will  use  additive manufacturing  to  repair  or  replace  existing  parts.  Phase  two  will reduce multipart assembly from a series of parts to one part. Phase three will use additive manufacturing to create new parts that do not already exist.

By the end of FY 2017, sixteen of the Army's arsenals and depots had some 3-D printing capability. In October 2016, a program to create weapons and shells using additive manufacturing, the Rapid Additively Manufactured  Ballistics  Ordnance  (RAMBO),  was  successful  in trials.  Project  RAMBO demonstrated that more than 90 percent of the components for the M203 grenade launcher could be 3-D printed, as well as the ammunition shell casings. The Army is developing an expeditionary Rapid Fabrication via Additive Manufacturing on the Battlefield (R-FAB) system to produce critical supplies, parts, tools, and packaging at the point of need for sustainment supply activities. R-FAB Generation 1.0 was demonstrated at the Army Warfighting Assessment in October 2016 and R-FAB Generation 1.5 was used on paciFic pathWayS 17-3 in August-September 2017.

The Army began fielding  the  Global  Combat  Support  SystemArmy in February 2013 using  the  wave  approach  to  not  shock  the logistics  supply  chain  and  cause  disruption  to  ongoing  operations.

Global  Combat  Support  System-Army  is  a  logistics  and  financial system  for  both  units  and  installations.  It  tracks  supplies,  spare parts,  organizational  equipment,  unit  maintenance,  and  financial transactions related to logistics. The system, based on a commercial software program, replaces the Standard Army Management Information  Systems  and  integrates  about  40,000  local  supply  and logistics  databases.  Wave  one  fielding  was  completed  in  November 2015. Wave two fielding, begun in August 2015, continued during FY 2017. It will replace the Property Book Unit Supply-Enhanced and the Standard Maintenance System-Enhanced. Wave two is scheduled for completion in November 2017.

## Foreign Military Sales

The  Army  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  program  was  part of  the  U.S.  Defense  Security  Assistance  program,  which  transfers defense materials and services to foreign countries and international organizations.  The  FMS  program  supports  U.S.  foreign  policy  and national security goals by strengthening bilateral defense relationships. The Army's FMS program is managed by the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army,  Defense  Exports  &amp;  Cooperation, which has authority over $14.8 billion in international sales of Army equipment, training, supplies and services during the year. In a signal of  the  importance  of  the  programs,  the  Army  received  approval  to exempt all FMS staff positions from personnel reductions in FY 2017 and  beyond.  Among  the  prominent  FMS  transactions  in  FY  2017 were contracts to provide: TOW missiles to Bahrain, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and Patriot equipment to Romania, 120-mm. tank ammunition to Australia, JLTVs to the United Kingdom, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles to the United Arab Emirates, CH-47D Chinook helicopters to Greece and Saudi Arabia, and AH-64 Apache helicopters to the United Arab Emirates.

## Installation Management

In preparing its part of the Army  Strategic Readiness Assessment, the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) assessed significant risk to the installation tenet of readiness through FY 2017 and projected this risk to remain through FY 2021. The high number of facilities rated Q3 and Q4 on installation status reports contributed to the overall risk. A Q3rated facility fails to meet the minimum level of Army standards for  at  least  one  major  rated  component, and the cost to improve is no more than 40 percent of the replacement value. A Q4 facility fails  to  meet  the  minimum  level  of  Army  standards  for  multiple rated components, but the cost to improve exceeds 40 percent of the replacement value.

The  Facility  Readiness  Drivers  framework  was  established  in August 2017 to focus installation readiness reporting and to optimize facility investments based upon commanders' input. The framework will  link  facilities  to  war  fighting  readiness  and  lethality.  Three  sets of  indicators  will  be  used.  The  first  is  mission  readiness:  Can  the installation provide infrastructure and services to support the missions of units assigned there? The second is soldier and family readiness: Can  the  installation  provide  infrastructure  and  services  that  enable soldier  readiness,  support  soldier  and  family  resilience,  and  allow soldiers  to  focus  on  the  mission?  The  third  is  installation  capacity: Does the installation have assured access to energy, water, and land and air space to support current and future missions?

Army Directive 2017-07, published in February 2017, established a policy for the security of installations' water and energy capabilities. The objective  is  for  installations  to  be  capable  of  providing,  from their  own  resources,  the  energy  and  water  necessary  for  them  to conduct their critical missions for fourteen days after the interruption of energy and water from off-post sources. The Assistant Secretary of  the  Army  (Installations,  Energy  and  Environment),  OACSIM, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, will develop business rules for  defining  and  assessing  energy  and  water  security  risks,  and for  prioritizing  mitigation  actions  within  existing  authorities  and

programs. Each landholding command will plan, program, budget, and execute energy and water projects that close energy and water security gaps and reduce risk. Landholding commands will prioritize projects in existing programs, including efficient use of third-party resources, operations and maintenance  accounts, and military construction, as appropriate.

OACSIM developed  a  major  revision  of  AR  5-9, Installation Support Agreements , and began work on creating a handbook with 'how-to'  procedures  and  training  modules.  The  AR  5-9  revision consolidates  AR  37-49, Budgeting,  Funding,  and  Reimbursement for Base Operations Support of Army Activities ,  and AR 5-9, Area Support Responsibilities , to better define Army-wide  roles for developing,  funding,  and  managing  installation  agreements.  The anticipated release date for the revised AR 5-9 is the third quarter of FY 2018.

During  FY  2017,  OACSIM  conveyed  3,626  acres  of  excess installation  property  on  behalf  of  the  Army.  During  these  conveyances, the Army transferred 2,496 acres of the former Fort Wingate, New Mexico, to the Department of Interior; completed almost all of the conveyance  of  the  former  Walter  Reed  Army  Medical  Center  in Washington, D.C.; and closed three Army Reserve sites under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). Revenues from land sales  were  transferred  into  the  BRAC  account  and  made  available to  accelerate  the  completion  of  environmental  cleanup  at  BRAC installations.

In  January  2015,  the  Department  of  Defense  announced  the European  Infrastructure Consolidation program. The  program will  close  twenty-nine  Army  sites  in  Europe  with  a  total  plant replacement  value  of  approximately  $2.7  billion  and  yield  annual recurring savings of $180 million by FY 2024. The program will cost $338 million from FY 2016 to FY 2023. During FY 2017, the Army closed Giessen Army Depot in Germany. In this fiscal year, the Army saved $34 million from completion of eleven initial adjustments and three final actions in FY 2016.

## Public Affairs

During FY 2017, the Army emphasized the importance of online conduct in both official and personal capacities consistent with the service's  values  and  standards  of  conduct.  Soldiers,  their  families, civilian employees, and contractors represent the Army online and offline  and  are  personally  responsible  for  all  content  they  publish on social networking sites, blogs, and other Web sites. An All Army

Activities message in February 2017 directed the tracking of online misconduct  incidents;  providing  information  to  soldiers'  families to  raise  awareness  of  this  issue;  and  updating  mandatory  annual training  to  include  material  regarding  the  online  conduct  policy. The following month, the acting secretary of the Army; the chief of staff, Army; and the sergeant major of the Army issued a message on proper online conduct.

In May 2017, the Army launched a new social media microsite for social media managers, soldiers, their families, and civilian employees. Created  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Public  Affairs'  Digital  Media Division, the Army Social Media microsite replaced the 'Social Media Handbook'  PDF  file.  The  new  site  provides  policies,  guidance,  and recommendations  on  becoming  more  effective  communicators  and representatives of the Army. It will allow trusted information concerning the Army to be disseminated to the public in a timely manner. The site also includes information regarding security when using social media, ways to report scams, and techniques criminals use on social media.

## Chaplain Corps

The transformation of the chaplain assistant military occupational specialty into the religious affairs specialist specialty continued during FY 2017. This change in designation will become effective 1 October 2017. It recognizes the current designation no longer fits the expectations now inherent in this specialty as a member of the unit ministry team both in operational matters and in providing religious care to soldiers. In August 2017, as part of this transformation, the Army Chaplain Center and School began publishing a professional journal for religious affairs specialists.

During FY 2017, the Chaplain Corps continued its Strong Bonds Program, training soldiers and their family members in relationship skills and in meeting the challenges of Army family life. With a budget of $35.4 million, the program provided 1,550 events for 32,322 soldiers and 40,399 family members. The program trained 316 chaplains and religious affairs specialists in the specifics of planning and conducting Strong Bonds events.

## Safety

The on-duty ground Class A mishap rate increased 27 percent during FY 2017 and  was  slightly  higher  than  the  five-year  average,  but  total associated soldier fatalities were at their lowest level since FY 2008. Army vehicle  mishaps  were  primarily  responsible  for  the  increase  in  on-duty

Sgt. Maj. Reeves Winters, chaplain sergeant major for the 101st Airborne Division, congratulates Pfc. Boaz Koski, chaplain assistant for the 101st Special Troops Battalion, on earning the title of the 101st Airborne Division Chaplain Assistant of the Year.



Class A mishaps. Thirteen soldiers died in twenty-one Class A on-duty Army or private motor vehicle mishaps during FY 2017, compared to sixteen fatalities in thirteen vehicle mishaps the year prior. Approximately 64 percent of FY 2017's Class A-D Army vehicle mishaps were attributed to operator error, with speed, inattention, and poor judgment the most prevalent contributing factors. Passenger injury accounted for a further 16 percent, resulting from rough terrain, sudden stops, shifting cargo, or weapons systems or hatches. Vehicle fires increased during the past five years and made up 8 percent of all FY 2017 mishaps, a 3 percent increase from  FY  2016.  Three  on-duty  Class  A  weapons/explosives  mishaps resulted in four soldier fatalities, an increase of one fatality from FY 2016. Two soldier fatalities occurred during physical fitness training and one soldier died during a night scuba dive.

The Army experienced seventy-six Class A-C manned aircraft mishaps during FY 2017, with nine Class A mishaps resulting in ten  fatalities,  as  compared  to  seventy-three  Class  A-C  mishaps, eight  Class  A  mishaps,  and  eight  fatalities  in  FY  2016.  Manned mishap rates remained near historic lows through FY 2017, with no significant new causal trends. Human error caused approximately

80 percent of all manned  aviation mishaps. For unmanned aircraft,  there  were  seventy-four  Class  A-C  and  fifteen  Class  A mishaps,  compared  to  fifty-five  and  fourteen,  respectively,  in  FY 2016. Materiel failure remained the predominant causal factor in unmanned aviation mishaps.

Two Department of the Army civilian employees died in on-duty mishaps  during  FY  2017.  Both  fatalities-involving  operation  of heavy  equipment-were  attributed  to  'caught-in/between,'  one  of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's top four causal factors  in  construction  operations.  Overall,  civilian  employee  injury claims were up in FY 2017, but data indicate no new loss trends or any significant changes to injury cause. The total injury and illness case rate fell from 2.02 in FY 2016 to 1.77 in FY 2017, and the lost-time injury and illness case rate dropped from 1.18 to 1.09.

Total off-duty soldier Class A mishaps increased from eighty-five in FY 2016 to ninety-three in FY 2017. Sustaining a decades-long trend, private motor vehicle mishaps-seventy-three in FY 2017accounted for the majority of off-duty Class A mishaps. Sixty-five soldiers died in off-duty private motor vehicle mishaps. As in past years, the leading causal factors were speeding, failure to wear seat belts,  alcohol  use,  and  (for  motorcycle  mishaps)  failure  to  wear protective equipment. Soldier fatality rates in private motor vehicle mishaps are lower than the nation as a whole. Eleven soldiers were killed in off-duty pedestrian mishaps during FY 2017, compared to four in FY 2016. Approximately a third of those mishaps involved alcohol,  and  all  but  one  occurred  after  dark.  Three  soldiers  were killed in off-duty weapons-handling mishaps. Of the remaining offduty fatal mishaps, eight soldiers died during water-related activities, two in privately owned aircraft mishaps, two while participating in winter sports, two in a single cabin fire, and one while engaging in high-risk sexual behavior.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

FY 2017 was another difficult year for the retail industry with thousands of store closures and multiple retailers filing for bankruptcy. In addition, several major e-commerce retailers continued to squeeze brick-and-mortar locations and drive up freight and shipping costs for other e-retailers. Despite this difficult environment, the Exchange's revenue this fiscal  year  was  $8.6  billion,  an  increase  of  more  than $300 million from FY 2016, with $376 million in dividend-eligible earnings. From those earnings, the Exchange provided $219 million in dividends to quality-of-life programs such as school lunches for

military children overseas, child care centers, youth programs, and jobs for veterans and military spouses.

The Exchange invested $208 million in total capital expenditures to  improve the shopping experience for its customers. Roughly half of the total was related to upgrading stores and restaurants as well as  enhancements  to  the  supply  chain.  The  other  half  was  spent  on technology assets associated with improving operational efficiencies.

To offer greater convenience and strengthen funding for critical quality-of-life  programs,  military  commissaries  began  accepting the  Exchange's  MILITARY  STAR  credit  card  in  October  2016. The Exchange administers the MILITARY STAR credit program for all military exchange systems and Defense Commissary Agency (DCA). In the first four months after this change, acceptance of the MILITARY STAR card at commissaries saved the DCA more than $860,000  in  swipe  fees  associated  with  bank-issued  credit  cards. Additionally, the 1 percent the Exchange provides back to the DCA each month has resulted in a nearly $510,000 revenue stream for the  commissaries.  By  the  end  of  FY  2017,  170,000  commissary shoppers had used their MILITARY STAR card to buy nearly $51 million in groceries.

In January 2017, the Department of Defense announced a policy change that would extend limited online military exchange shopping privileges to all honorably discharged veterans of the military. This change  will  go  into  effect  on  Veterans  Day  in  November  2017. Although this shopping privilege excludes the purchase of uniforms, alcohol,  and  tobacco  products,  it  will  provide  veterans  tax-free shopping and an average savings of 20 percent off manufacturers' suggested  retail  prices  on  a  wide  variety  of  brands.  At  maturity, the veterans program is expected to have added sales of about $200 million  for  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service,  which  will yield additional annual dividends of $20 million to support qualityof-life programs.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

A revised AR 608-10, Child Development Services , was published in  May  2017.  The  revision  removed  exclusionary  language  and required  reasonable  accommodation  for  all  children  with  special needs  in  child,  youth,  and  school  services  programs.  The  Army  is implementing new procedures to accommodate requests for the dayto-day care of children/youth with diabetes and other complex special medical  needs.  To  ensure  successful  implementation,  the  assistant chief  of  staff  for  installation  management  and  the  Installation

Management  Command  are  providing technical assistance to garrisons accommodating children with diabetes who require support for insulin dosage determination and administration, as well as other complex medical needs.

## Special Functions

Surgeon General

In FY 2017, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG) completed its  internal  'One-Staff  Reorganization'  with  U.S.  Army  Medical Command  (MEDCOM).  The  intent  of  the  reorganization  was  to make Army medicine more responsive to operational requirements. This reorganization had been initiated in 2016 with the consolidation of fifteen Regional Health Headquarters into four multidisciplinary Regional Health Commands.

The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act set out specific changes  to  the  organization  and  functions  of  healthcare  in  the Department of Defense. The act mandated that the Defense Health Agency  would  take  control  of  more  than  400  military  hospitals and clinics operated by the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This move ultimately  would  centralize  the  administration  and  functions  of military  treatment  facilities,  while  allowing  each  individual  service to  retain  its  own  autonomous  medical  departments.  During  FY 2017, the OTSG began to implement these legislative changes, with the goal of moving toward a more efficient and integrated military healthcare system.

The acquisition, development, employment, and retention of a broad  and  diverse  spectrum  of  healthcare  talent  remained  critical to conducting missions across multiple domains and to meeting the challenges of enduring requirements and unanticipated contingencies. The Army's reputation for superior clinical training and leadership development helped to boost recruiting and retention efforts. At 92 percent, the first-time medical board certification pass rate by Army personnel well exceeded the 86 percent national average.

In  FY  2017,  the  Army  began  fielding  a  new  organizational design  to  increase  its  forward-based  medical  capabilities.  The conversion  reconfigures  the  248-bed  combat  support  hospital into  a  32-bed  field  hospital  with  three  additional  augmentation detachments:  a  24-bed  surgical  detachment,  a  32-bed  medical detachment, and a 60-bed intermediate care ward detachment. The field  hospital  and  the  augmentation  detachments  will  all  operate under  the  authority  of  a  headquarters  hospital  center.  The  new

design is based on more than a decade of combat in which combat support hospitals were too large and logistically difficult to deploy as a whole. Instead, they were usually deployed in 'slices,' and the field hospital design codifies that practice. In June 2017, the 10th Combat Support Hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado, became the first unit to convert to the new field hospital design. Over the next five  years,  the  Army  plans  to  convert  the  rest  of  the  active  duty combat support hospitals, Army Reserve hospitals that are part of the Medical Materiel Readiness Program, and Army Pre-positioned Sustainment stocks hospitals.

The  OTSG  also  continued  to  stress  the  importance  of  virtual health  capabilities.  Virtual  health  involves  use  of  medical  devices such as electrocardiograms that can send information to healthcare providers over the internet, along with high-resolution video showing the patient in great detail. Virtual health allows specialists to diagnose and  prescribe  medication  or  treatment  from  a  distance,  to  include allowing  providers  to  walk  medics  who  are  on-site  with  an  injured patient  through  emergency  care.  The  OTSG  was  in  the  process  of conducting more than forty pilot programs in virtual health, and the

Army Virtual Medical Center at Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas, is expected to open in FY 2018.

The OTSG placed special emphasis on issues of behavioral health through  the  Embedded  Behavioral  Health  program.  The  program provides behavior health intervention and treatment to soldiers in close proximity to their unit area. They receive expedited evaluations and treatment from a single provider, which greatly improves continuity of care and facilitated close coordination with unit leaders. The enduring working relationship between the behavioral health provider and key battalion personnel also addressed the stigma commonly associated with this type of care. Overall use of behavioral healthcare increased from approximately 900,000 encounters in FY 2007 to more than 2.25 million in FY 2017. Between 2012 and 2017, 45 percent fewer soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder were prescribed benzodiazepines, a potentially addictive group of medicines. Taking account of the Army family, improved behavioral health services also extended to a hundred on-post schools across eighteen installations in FY 2017.

The  Army  continued  to  make  significant  advances  in  medical research. In November 2016, doctors at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research initiated a clinical trial of the ZPIV vaccine for the Zika virus. Within ten months, the Army had produced the ZPIV trial vaccine for use in animals and demonstrated its effectiveness in mice and monkeys. Researchers then began initiating clinical trials in humans to establish the vaccine's safety and to build the case for subsequent efficacy trials. Seventy-five healthy adults participated in the phase one trial.

## Army Audit Agency

The  Army  Audit  Agency's  mission  is  to  help  senior  leaders assess and mitigate risk by providing independent internal auditing services.  Sixty  employees  were  based  at  the  agency's  operations center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and at the Pentagon. The rest of the workforce was divided between sixteen field offices-thirteen in the continental United States and one each in Hawaii, Germany, and Korea. The agency began to implement its FY 2017/2021 Strategic Plan,  creating  process  action  teams  (PAT)  to  work  through  new initiatives.  For  example,  a  PAT  was  created  to  streamline  audit reports and develop additional methods to communicate results to Army leaders. Another PAT developed standard performance plans for about 90 percent of the agency workforce.

The agency's  FY  2017  Internal  Audit  Plan  assessed  Army-wide programs and functions, identifying twelve risk areas for audit focusacquisition, audit readiness, contracting, cyber, financial management,

health readiness of the force, human capital, installations, intelligence, protection,  sustainment,  and  training.  The  agency  published  105 reports with $1.7 billion in potential monetary benefits and made 400 recommendations to improve Army operations.

## Army National Military Cemeteries

During FY 2017, the Army National Military Cemeteries (ANMC) continued to support the Army's forty-two cemeteries across nineteen states. Army cemeteries ranged in size from those having only a small number of remains interred on less than one-tenth of an acre to the largest, Arlington National Cemetery (ANC), which contained more than 400,000 remains on 624 acres.

The most significant ANMC  project  of  FY  2017  was  the disinterment of three graves at the Carlisle Barracks post cemetery in August 2017. The graves held the remains of three children from the Northern Arapaho tribe. From 1879 to 1918, more than 10,000 Native American  children  from  more  than  fifty  tribes  attended  the  former United  States  Indian  Industrial  School  in  Carlisle,  Pennsylvania. Operated by the Department of Interior, the school was the nation's first federal off-reservation boarding school. The remains of 180 named Native Americans were interred in the cemetery, and in 1927 they were moved to the Carlisle Barracks post cemetery. At the request of their closest living relatives, the three deceased children to be disinterred were Little Plume (Hayes Vanderbilt Friday), Little Chief (Dickens Nor), and Horse (Horace Washington). To improve the disinterment process and to manage expectations, the ANMC conducted five listening sessions at  Cherokee,  North  Carolina;  Anchorage,  Alaska;  Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma; Bloomington, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona.

With the help of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, archeologists excavated the remains with hand tools and sifted the soil to recover any human remains and artifacts. A forensic anthropologist then examined the remains for consistency between the age and sex of the remains with  the  Army's  records.  Two  sets  of  remains  were  consistent.  The remains from the other grave were not only inconsistent but were also determined to be from two different decedents. They were reburied in two separate graves at the Carlisle Barracks post cemetery and marked as unknown. After the remains, artifacts, and soil were casketed by a local funeral home, the Army transferred custody to family members on  14  August.  The  remains  were  reinterred  on  18  August  in  three private cemeteries on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming.

During the fiscal year, ANMC executed a semijoint contract with ANC to collect aerial and geographic information system imagery

for thirty-seven cemeteries. This collection effort supports creation of  the  ANMC Mapper, as well as the ANMC Gravesite Explorer system, which remained under development. These innovations will allow the public to search ANC by name and location in order to find a  specific  gravesite,  including  a  picture  of  the  headstone,  an  aerial map, and basic decedent data. ANMC also supported the Enterprise Interment  Scheduling  System-a  combined  effort  with  ANC  to ensure burial accountability and to improve automated workflows of interment processes.

During FY 2017, ANC laid to rest 7,068 veterans, armed forces service  members, and eligible family members. Of these, 4,451 were in  new  graves  and  2,617  were  subsequent  interments.  ANC  saw a  continuation  of  recent  burial  trends  with  28  percent  casketed,  37 percent inurned in niches, and 35 percent placed in-ground, but inurned rather than casketed. ANC continued its long ceremonial traditions by coordinating and facilitating full, standard, and dependent funeral honors  ceremonies,  along  with  approximately  700  placements  of remains  in  quiet  ceremonies  at  the  family's  request,  referred  to  as

'placement only.' ANC conducted forty-four full honors and more than 3,100 public wreath ceremonies along with 270 other events.

As of FY 2017, ANC was 74 percent occupied. The remaining grave locations were expected to be available through approximately 2041. ANC continued to be in high demand by families in their time of need, receiving 7,043 requests for funeral services from families during 2017. Work continued on the Millennium expansion construction and Southern expansion project planning. The secretary of the Army, in February 2017, submitted a report to Congress on ANC's interment and  inurnment  capacity.  This  report  outlined  potential  options  or actions that might be taken, legislatively or nonlegislatively, to allow ANC to remain open well into the future, defined by the Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery as 150 years. Following this report, ANC provided a survey to the public to determine popular opinion on the future of the cemetery. Data from this survey showed that wide support existed to keep ANC open beyond 2041. Outreach, study, and analysis continue into FY 2018.

## Civil Works

The  civil  works  program  of  the  Corps  of  Engineers  has  three main  missions:  flood  and  storm  damage  reduction,  commercial navigation, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The program is also concerned  with  related  issues  like  hydropower,  stewardship,  and recreation. In FY 2017, the program employed nearly 34,000 civilians and 750 soldiers.

The Corps of Engineers engaged in dozens of projects to reduce the  risk  of  coastal  and  riverine  flood  damage.  In  January  2017,  the Sacramento District awarded a $20.46 million contract to construct levee  improvements  in  the  Natomas  Basin  in  Sacramento-one  of the  nation's  most  at-risk  areas  for  catastrophic  flooding.  The  work to upgrade more than two miles of levees along the southern side of the river basin is part of a wider effort to improve a 42-mile stretch in partnership with the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency and the  state  of  California.  In  September  2017,  the  Corps  of  Engineers awarded an additional $204 million contract to construct modifications to the Isabella Lake Dam, some forty miles northeast of Bakersfield. The award marked the beginning of efforts to address overtopping, seismic, and seepage concerns at the dam.

In the Jacksonville District, work continued on the Herbert Hoover Dike,  a  143-mile  earthen  dam  that  surrounds  Lake  Okeechobee,  to reduce the risk of overtopping. The lake is a key water supply for some six million people in south Florida. At the same time, Lake Okeechobee

carries  a  high  risk  of  flooding  as  a  result  of  continually  high  water levels. Army Engineers installed thirty-five miles of seepage barriers, known as cutoff walls, to limit erosion of the earthen structure of the dike.

Working  with  the Federal Emergency  Management  Agency (FEMA), the Corps of Engineers  played  a  vital  role  in  the  federal government's response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. After Harvey hit Texas, engineers from the Galveston District maintained 24-hour  monitoring  of  the  Addicks  and  Barker  Reservoirs  west  of downtown Houston. They released storm water from the two reservoirs to  draw  down  record  levels.  Two  Corps  of  Engineers-maintained reservoirs collectively retained more than 140 billion gallons of storm water, which otherwise would have flowed uncontrolled into Houston.

Days later, Hurricane Irma hit the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida, and the Corps of Engineers received a FEMA mission assignment  to  generate  temporary  electricity  in  affected  areas. Three power planning and response teams deployed to assist with generator installations and power assessments. In addition, experts on  debris  removal  deployed  to  assist  FEMA  with  management strategies. The  Corps  of  Engineers  also  supported  Operation Blue  Roof-a free service  that  provides  a  temporary  covering  of blue  plastic  sheeting  to  reduce  further  damage  to  property  until permanent repairs can be made.

After  Hurricane  Maria  made  landfall  in  the  Caribbean  in  midSeptember, the Corps of Engineers performed critical assessments of damaged roofs in the region. In Puerto Rico, engineers for Operation Blue Roof estimated 30,000 roofs need urgent repairs, while another 13,000 were damaged in the Virgin Islands. The Corps of Engineers coordinated  transportation  of  more  than  300  FEMA  and  Defense Logistics  Agency  generators  from  across  the  United  States  to  meet anticipated requirements in the islands.

To support the commercial navigation mission of the civil works program, the Corps of Engineers undertook extensive harbor, dam, and  lock  improvements  around  the  United  States.  In  September,  it announced  a  $22  million  contract  to  deepen  the  federal  navigation channel at the port of Jacksonville, Florida, from forty to forty-seven feet  so  that  deep-draft  ships  may  enter  the  port.  Work  on  a  similar harbor  expansion  project  in  Savannah,  Georgia,  continued  with  an anticipated  completion  time  of  January  2022.  The  Boston  Harbor Navigation Improvement Project began in September.

Army  engineers  also  made  progress  on  one  of  the  nation's longest-running  and  most  expensive  infrastructure  projects:  the Olmsted Locks and Dam on the Ohio River. Near the confluence

of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, the Olmsted project forms the hub of the Inland Waterways Transportation System. More tonnage passes  through  this  point  than  at  any  other  place  in  America's inland navigation system. The project, estimated at a total cost of $2.7  billion,  consists  of  two  110-foot  by  1,200-foot  locks  adjacent to the Illinois bank of the Ohio River, as well as a dam comprised of five tainter gates, 1,400 feet of boat-operated wickets, and a fixed weir. The Corps of Engineers expects that the locks and dam will be operational in FY 2018.

The Corps of Engineers engaged in extensive environmental and conservation  work.  It  allocated  more  than  $70  million  to  continue improving the process by which fish pass through federal dams in the Columbia River Basin of the Pacific Northwest. In the Jacksonville District, nearly  $117  million  was  used  for  continued  ecosystem restoration in south Florida, including the Everglades.

The Corps of Engineers is responsible for evaluating and issuing permits for all water crossings under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Sections 10 and 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. On 4 December 2016, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works indicated that the Corps of Engineers would not approve an easement

authorizing  Dakota  Access  LLC  to  construct  a  proposed  pipeline under Lake Oahe Reservoir on the Missouri River in North Dakota, approximately half a mile upstream from the northern boundary of the  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. The project was known popularly as the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In January 2017, the president directed the secretary of the Army to review and approve in an expedited manner requests for approvals to construct and operate the pipeline, including easement or right-ofways. In February 2017, the acting secretary of the Army announced the  Corps  of  Engineers  completed  the  presidential-directed  review of  the  easement  request  and  notified  Congress  it  intended  to  grant right-of-way. This action was intended to facilitate completion of the last mile of the 1,172-mile pipeline, connecting the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois.

## Environmental Protection

To support water security, Army installations undertook a variety of projects in FY 2017, ranging in size from small-scale reclamation to a new water treatment plant at Fort Irwin, California. This facility had a 99 percent water recovery rate, substantially reducing waste in the treatment process. The Army, as a whole, reduced its potable water use intensity by 32 percent in FY 2017, as compared to the FY 2007 baseline.  Installations  also  produced  more  than  eightynine million gallons of alternative water between FY 2011 and FY 2017 via wastewater reclamation and onsite rainwater harvesting. The  Army  continued  to  employ  a  comprehensive  approach  on renewable  energy.  Cost-effective  investments  included  small-scale solar projects on rooftops and parking areas. The Office of Energy Initiatives  also  leveraged  funding  and  financing  for  much  larger projects through joint initiatives with private enterprises. The Army increased its renewable energy capacity for the third year in a row, adding 176.1 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity capacity in FY 2017 through thirty-three new projects for a total of 428.6 MW. This amounted to a 69.7 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.  The  total  percentage  of  renewable  electric  energy  eligible toward the goal of the 2005 Energy Policy Act increased from 5.8 percent in FY 2016 to 8.4 percent in FY 2017. The renewable energy production  credited  toward  the  National  Defense  Authorization Act FY 2010 goal increased by 3.6 percent from FY 2016 to FY 2017. Fort Hunter Liggett, California, installed a smart grid with dynamic controls to adjust for renewable energy production, while

the Reserve Center at Ceiba, Puerto Rico, completed a photovoltaic and microgrid project that enhanced whole-site resilience against historically  frequent  power  utility  outages.  In  June,  Fort  Hood completed  construction  of  the  Army's  largest  hybrid  renewable energy  project.  The  Phantom  Solar  Field-a  15  MW  alternating current solar array-was made up of 60,000 panels spread out over 130  acres  of  Fort  Hood.  In  addition,  twenty-one  wind  turbines located off base provided a further sixty MW of clean, renewable energy.  The  project  was  estimated  to  meet  nearly  half  of  Fort Hood's energy needs.

To mitigate the threat of contamination from hazardous materials, the Army worked to clean up thousands of former defense sites,  many  dating  back  to  World  War  II.  Decontamination  work continued  at  the  Umatilla  Chemical  Depot,  Oregon.  The  Army submitted  a  draft  agreement  to  transfer  the  land  to  local  officials at  the  Columbia  Development  Authority.  In  March  2017,  Joint Base  Lewis-McChord,  Washington,  was  forced  to  withdraw  three contaminated  groundwater  wells  from  service  after  they  produced higher-than-normal readings for two kinds of fluorinated chemicals, perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid, used in fireretardant foams. The Army identified a further sixty-one installations

at risk for similar contamination, and in FY 2017, it initiated thirteen environmental investigations. These investigations remained ongoing as the fiscal year came to an end.

The  Army  engaged  in  conservation  activities,  completing  fiftyone  environmental  assessments  and  more  than  7,000  Records  of Environmental Consideration in FY  2017 in compliance with the National  Environmental  Policy  Act.  Installations  undertook significant pollution prevention efforts, diverting more than 405,873 tons of waste for recycling and reuse. This amount accounted for 47 percent of total solid waste from Army landfills.

The  Army  also  managed  226  threatened  and  endangered  plant and animal species on 124 installations, as well as 116,480 acres of Endangered  Species  Act  critical  habitat  and  1.3  million  acres  of wetlands. It prepared integrated natural resources management plans at 148 installations. These endeavors led to the successful recovery of several endangered species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker on Fort Bragg and Fort Stewart and the black-capped vireo and goldencheeked warbler on Fort Hood.

## Legal

In FY  2017,  the  Office  of  The  Judge  Advocate  General (OTJAG) focused on combatting sexual violence in the Army and on adapting to the requirements of the 2016 Military Justice Act. Many of the OTJAG's efforts involved Trial and Defense Counsel Assistance Programs, which provided personnel and expert advice on numerous high-profile trials. The Trial Counsel Assistance Program managed the operations of the Special Victim Prosecution, which continued  to  build  the  Army's  capability  to  effectively  prosecute sexual  and  family  abuse  offenses.  The  Army  added  twenty-three special victims' prosecutors, as well as twenty-three special victim witness liaisons. The Army's Special Victim Counsel (SVC) program continued to grow and improve, providing a holistic approach to victim care. In FY 2017, the SVC grew from twenty-three to fortysix authorizations. The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School  in  Charlottesville,  Virginia,  developed  and  improved  the SVC Certification course, part of the certification process required of  judge  advocates  before  they  are  authorized  to  take  clients.  In these courses, students learn best practices for working with sexual assault victims.

In FY 2017, the OTJAG continued to monitor military justice requirements in the Military Justice Act of 2016, which is slated to go into effect on 1 January 2019. The act initiated the most significant

changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in more than  thirty  years.  The  OTJAG  supervised  the  establishment  of  a Military  Justice  Legislation  Training  Team,  tasked  with  providing training products and instruction on the new act; advising on policy changes  required  for  its  implementation;  and  assisting  in  revising Army  Regulations, Department  of  the Army  Pamphlets,  and requisite  policies.  The  Military  Justice  Legislation  Training  Team planned training seminars for 2018 on the revised UCMJ to ensure the  OTJAG was prepared to transition seamlessly to the amended code.

At the end of FY 2017, the attorney strength of the JAGC active component was 1,819, of whom 504 were women. The total number of attorneys also included 116 African Americans, 57 Hispanics, 105 Asians, and 2 Native Americans. In the Army Reserve the attorney strength was 1,831, while the Army National Guard was 876.

The number of courts-martial decreased from 826 in FY 2016 to 795 in FY 2017. In FY 2017, there were 558 general courts-martial and 237 special courts-martial ( Tables 11-14 ).

## Conclusion

Fiscal year 2017 had the unenviable distinction of being the fiscal year that saw the longest period to date-216 days-in which the Army operated under a continuing resolution instead of an approved budget. The uncertainty of funding levels created challenges for leaders at all levels. This uncertainty returned when the fiscal year ended without an approved budget for FY 2018. The absence of a Senate-confirmed secretary of the Army for most of FY 2017 generated another type of uncertainty.

In the area of personnel, FY 2017 produced mixed results. The National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  when  finally  signed  into  law, brought a welcomed increase in authorized strength. Work continued on a new personnel system based on the concept of talent management. Success in meeting the Regular Army enlistment goal was offset by the failure to meet enlisted recruiting goals in the reserve components. Changes  regarding  Military  Accessions  Vital  to  National  Interest personnel and transgender policy generated uncertainty.

The Army  continued its efforts to improve its readiness, particularly for combined arms operations against a peer competitor. Among  the  steps  taken  were  conversion  of  an  infantry  brigade combat team into an armored brigade combat team, the expansion of Army Pre-positioned Stocks, the Multi-Domain Battle concept, and a new network modernization concept. Security force assistance brigades will permit brigade combat teams to focus on combined arms training while at the same time sustaining the service's capabilities to assist other nations' land forces. The reserve components continued their  efforts  at  improving  readiness  with  such  measures  as  Army National  Guard  4.0  and  Operation cold  Steel .  Near  the  end  of FY 2017,  soldiers  from  the  Army  National  Guard  and  the  Army Reserve demonstrated their readiness by again assisting their fellow citizens in the aftermath of hurricanes. These efforts coexisted with a continuing high demand by combatant commands for units from all  three  components.  Although  deployed  forces  were  far  fewer  in number than earlier in this century, the efforts required to meet these demands continued to kill and wound soldiers.
