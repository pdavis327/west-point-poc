## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2002

## Introduction

War, and the possibility of war, dominated fiscal year (FY) 2002. Following the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001, the Army devoted much of its  resources  and  energy  to  homeland  security  operations, toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan, and counterterrorism operations elsewhere in the world. During the latter half of the year, the Army began  preparing  for  a  possible  invasion  of  Iraq  to  overthrow  the regime of Saddam Hussein.

Outside  of  war  and  preparation  for  war,  the  Army  continued to  invest  considerable  work  in  transforming  itself  into  a  service better  suited  for  the  conditions  of  a  post-Cold  War  world.  Along with changes to the operational forces, the Army undertook several major  reorganizations  of  its  institutional  elements,  most  notably  in Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), and in its logistical systems.

Continuing disagreement between the service's senior leaders and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld over the proper course of transforming the Army led to the cancellation of the Crusader selfpropelled howitzer in FY 2002. Nevertheless, the Army's research and development  efforts  continued  to  focus  on  supporting  the  service's transformation initiatives. The centerpiece of Army transformation, the  Future  Combat  Systems  (FCS),  had  become  a  program  of such complexity that during FY 2002 the service decided to use an unprecedented lead system integrator contract. At the same time, the Army continued the process of equipping and training the first of the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, the interim force that will bridge the gap between the service's current and future force structures.

The Army had an excellent year in recruiting and retaining enlisted personnel. The troubling trend of the last several years of inadequate junior  officer  retention  continued;  the  service  took  several  steps  to address the problem in FY 2002. As part of the transformation effort, studies on noncommissioned officer and warrant officer training and development  were  released.  The  Army  continued  work  on  several programs to improve the circumstances of soldiers and their families, most notably in regards to barracks and family housing.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

In May 2001, Secretary of the Army Thomas e. White ordered the creation of a Realignment Task Force to study ways to reduce duplicate personnel  activities  and  make  better  use  of  technology,  automation, and  systems-based  business  practices.  The  Deputy  Under  Secretary of the Army for International Affairs led the task force, which began work in  June  2001.  The  Realignment  Task  Force  proceeded  in  three phases: phase one concentrated on Headquarters, Department of the Army, phase two on field operating agencies, and phase three on major commands. During phase one, the task force had two guiding principles: the purpose of the Secretariat was to formulate policy and programs, and the purpose of the Army Staff was to prepare, plan, supervise, and execute  those  policies  and  programs.  Similarly,  the  Secretariat  would oversee the Army missions and functions coordinated by the Army Staff. The task force-operating offsite and on a close-hold basis-reviewed HQDA processes and functions. The task force intended to reduce and consolidate headquarters structures to eliminate overlapping functions and  redundant  layers  of  supervision.  Incorporating  findings  and recommendations from previous work on the subject, the task force also considered changes to the alignment of responsibilities and authorities within Headquarters, Department of the Army ( Appendix A ).

By  the  end  of  FY  2001,  the  planning  for  the  realignment  of Headquarters, Department of the Army, was largely complete. On 17 December 2001, the basic outline of the change was announced in  an  executive  summary  and  Department  of  the  Army  general Orders  3  authorized  the  reorganization  on  9  July  2002.  The resulting  modifications  divested  the  Secretariat  of  several  offices and  left  its  remaining  ones  better  organized  for  the  formulation of policy and provision of strategic guidance. In the most extreme case,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  for  International Affairs  was  disestablished  and  its  responsibilities  redistributed across  the  headquarters.  The  Army  Staff  reorganized  itself  to

mirror the Joint Staff by adopting the World War II-era general staff system and nomenclature ( Appendix B ). The Army Staff also added  personnel  slots-including  national  guardsmen  and  Army reservists-who  were  integrated  into  various  offices  as  a  means of reducing frictions between components. While the Army Staff and Secretariat  as  a  whole  gained  efficiencies,  certain  offices  and functions could not be divested or disestablished. As an unintended result of the realignment, the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army took on a number of 'orphans' that performed  vital  tasks  that  did  not  fall  neatly  into  other  HQDA offices or directorates.

As  a  capstone  to  the  Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army, reorganization, general Orders 3 established the executive Office of HQDA (eOH). This was an idea previously considered but rejected by Army leaders in the mid-1990s. The executive Office of HQDA included the Secretary of the Army; the Under Secretary of the Army; the Chief of Staff of the Army, general eric K. Shinseki; and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. This body was created to provide executive leadership  and  a  unified  decision-making  process  from  the  Army's highest  civilian  and  uniformed  leaders.  general  Orders  3  added  no new authorities, responsibilities, or duties to those already belonging to the constituents of the executive office.

Although the Realignment Task Force placed its primary emphasis on the reorganization of headquarters  during  phase  one,  it also considered the issue of Armywide installation management. The Army's  fifteen  major  commands were responsible for providing base support;  however,  there  were  no common  standards  for  garrison support; housing; or morale, welfare, and recreation operations. This led to installation and garrison commanders diverting sustainment, restoration, and maintenance funds to augment insufficient base operations and

support funds, which resulted in a variable  quality  of  life  on  installations. After  considering  several  proposals  to  address  this  problem,  the Realignment Task Force suggested in September 2001 that installation management be centralized under the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and environment and the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM). In October 2001, Secretary White accepted the proposal of the task force and created the U.S. Army Installation Management Agency (IMA), a field operating agency of the ACSIM.

The Secretary of the Army's intent that the Installation Management Agency be fully functional  within  a  year  strained  the limited  manpower  of  ACSIM,  which  was  a  relatively  small  office. This goal required the formation of an informal task force of external contractors  to  begin  the  initial  analysis  in  November  2001.  The  17 December 2001 executive summary of the Headquarters, Department of the Army, realignment provided limited guidance on the subject. It  directed  that  the  centralization  of  installations  through  regional directors-a  system  used  by  U.S.  Army,  europe,  and  U.S.  Army Medical Command-be adopted Army-wide and that the details be worked out with the major commands within six months.

The Transformation of Installation Management Task Force was established in March 2002. This new task force created and validated plans  to  incorporate  the  Army's  184  installations  under  IMA  and to have the Army's major commands set up their own task forces to reorganize  their  operations  within  the  proposed  seven  subordinate regional  commands.  This  process  included  the  transfer  of  over

seventy  thousand civilian  and  military  personnel  to  the  Installation Management Agency, and the tedious effort of establishing clear lines of  communication  from  senior  mission  and  garrison  commanders through the regional commands to the agency. To provide a forum for senior leaders to offer guidance and to create a sense of participation and inclusion in the effort, the agency created a steering group, the Installation  Management  Board  of  Directors.  This  steering  group was  chaired  by  the  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  and  included the commanders of major commands and other senior leaders. The Installation Management Agency is expected to be formally activated by a Department of the Army general orders early in FY 2003.

The Realignment Task Force addressed the fact that the Army's organization  and  supervision  of  its  personnel  was  divided  between components.  To  further  the  concept  of  a  unified  Army,  the  task force  suggested  integrating  the  Total  Army  Personnel  Command (TAPC)  and  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  Personnel  Command.  This was a practical solution that reduced inter-component frictions and eliminated  personnel  spaces  by  consolidating  functions.  However, it  also  represented a radical break with the traditional practice that commands below the Headquarters, Department of the Army, level controlled the management of their own personnel.

In  early  2002,  the  Human  Resources  Integrated  Product  Team (HRIPT) began an extensive survey of Army-wide human resources organizations to identify redundant and asynchronous practices and organizations.  The  team  included  representatives  from  the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs; the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, g-1; the Office of the Special Assistant for Business Transformation; the Army Manpower Analysis  Agency;  and  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve.  Between  June  and September 2002, the HRIPT developed a plan to merge the human resources activities of the Army's field operating agencies to achieve better integration between Army components. From the beginning the initiative to create a single human resources provider faced resistance. During the initial research phase the team met with opposition from the  major  commands  and  field  operating  agencies  surveyed.  The concept of a unified  agency  to  supervise  civilians  caused  particular dissent  from  some  major  commands,  which  were  reluctant  to  give up  control  of  their  civilian  personnel  agencies  and  management  of personnel funds. Tensions between the active and reserve components also hindered progress. At the close of FY 2002, work continued on this initiative.

The  U.S.  Army  Accessions  Command  was  established  by  a Department of the Army general orders on 15 February 2002 as a

subordinate command of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). It was charged with providing integrated command and control of the recruiting and initial military training of the Army's officer,  warrant officer,  and  enlisted  forces.  Placed  under  Accessions Command, as subordinate organizations, were U.S. Army Recruiting Command; U.S. Army Cadet Command; U.S. Army Training Center, Fort Jackson, South Carolina; and the Officer Candidate School, Fort Benning, georgia.

In  2001,  after  three  years  of  discussions  and  planning,  The Adjutant general drafted a proposal to merge the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii, with the U.S. Pacific Command's Joint  Task  Force-Full  Accounting.  In  March  2002,  representatives of  the  laboratory,  the  joint  task  force,  Pacific  Command,  the  Joint Staff,  and  the  Army  Staff  met  with  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary of Defense for POW/Missing Personnel Affairs to discuss a possible merger.  The  meeting  resulted  in  a  recommendation  to  the  Deputy Secretary  of  Defense  to  combine  the  two  organizations  in  order  to enhance operational effectiveness while maintaining the functions of both. The Joint Staff is preparing a draft 'terms of reference' for the new joint organization that is expected to be activated on 1 October 2003.

## Management Information Systems

The  Strategic  Readiness  System  (SRS)  is  an  integrated  strategic management and measurement system designed to ensure that all levels of the Army align their efforts with the objectives articulated in The Army Plan . Additionally, it measures progress toward achieving these goals. The SRS was developed after an Army War College study in January 2000 found that the existing readiness reporting system did not provide senior Army leadership with an adequate means to manage readiness. The system is based on a 'balanced scorecard' methodology, which uses lagging and leading indicators to measure progress toward achieving objectives.

The Army Scorecard is the foundation of the Strategic Readiness System. It sets out the objectives established by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army. The Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Army Scorecard on 13 March 2002. Headquarters, Department of the Army, and the major commands began working with  the  automated  version  of  their  scorecards  during  the  summer of  2002.  In  September  2002,  the  process  expanded  to  include  units subordinate to the Army Staff directorates and those subordinate to major  commands.  The  scorecards  of  these  organizations  will  align to the Army Scorecard to ensure that the goals of subordinate units

are consistent with the strategic objectives of the Army. Automated links reaching into approximately fifty-eight hundred separate Army databases retrieve the data used in the measurement portion of the scorecards. The system displays the status of objectives as red, amber, or green, indicating the degree of success toward achievement.

The  Strategic  Readiness  System  places  no  additional  reporting burdens  on  soldiers.  The  system  does  not  replace  the  current  Unit Status Report; it integrates the data required by the current system with data from the force generation and institutional elements of the Army to provide a holistic view of readiness across the service. It provides leaders down to the division and separate brigade level with a tool that facilitates allocating resources to maximize their unit's readiness.

In October 2001, the Department of the Army began implementation  of  the  Department  of  Defense  Common  Access Card program. The common access card is a new identification card for  soldiers,  Army  civilian  employees,  and  eligible  contractors.  The new card has three functions:  it identifies persons permitted access to  buildings  and  controlled  spaces,  it  allows  access  to  computer systems and networks, and it is the primary platform for the Public Key Infrastructure token. Fielding was expected to be completed by the end of FY 2002. However, problems with the Defense Information Security Agency's certification authorities, contaminated card stock, and a shortage of laminate derailed the Army's planned mass issuance plan and pushed the expected completion date back to October 2003.

## Budget

When it was submitted in June 2001,  the  Army's  budget  request for FY 2002 supported a balanced base funding program that allowed the  service  to  meet  its  objectives  for  the  year  without  the  need  for  a nonemergency supplemental appropriation ( Table  1 ).  This  reversed  a decade-long trend and allowed the Army to continue critical missions without  losing  momentum  or  diverting  funds  to  support  essential and  unavoidable  costs.  The  request  included  significant  increases  for installation services  and  infrastructure,  mitigating  the  need  to  divert  funds programmed for readiness training. It kept recruiting and advertising programs on track and funded continued improvements in barracks, housing, and strategic mobility facilities. Transformation programs were funded, although not at the desired level. There was some risk in the level of training funding, but these risks were considered acceptable to ensure stable base operations levels and improved facility maintenance and repair. Sustainment programs also remained stable, and the request would allow some modernization of the aging helicopter fleet to begin.

Operations  following  the  11  September  2001  terrorist  attack required  the  Department  of  Defense  to  request  a  supplemental appropriation for FY 2002. This supplement (Public Law 107-206), signed in August 2002, provided the Army with an additional $371.4 million:  $209 million for operations and maintenance; $79.2 million for other procurement; $8.2 million added to research, development, test  and  evaluation;  and  another  $75  million  for  the  destruction  of chemical agents and munitions.

The  FY  2003  budget  request,  submitted  in  February  2002,  was  a significant increase over the FY 2002 budget ( Table 2 ). The request provides for an end strength of 480,000 in the active Army, 350,000 in the Army National guard, and 205,000 in the Army Reserve. It included a pay raise of 4.1 percent, allowing for targeted raises by grade and years of service. Increases in housing allowances would reduce out-of-pocket expenses for military personnel from 11.3 percent in FY 2002 to 7.5 percent in FY 2003, putting  the  Army  on  track  for  eliminating  average  out-of-pocket  costs entirely by FY 2005 for those soldiers and families living on the economy . The  active  Army's  military  construction  budget  continued  to  focus  on facilities that upgrade the quality of life of soldiers and the capabilities of Army installations as power projection platforms. The Army family housing request reflected a shift of funding from new and replacement construction to the Family Housing Improvement Fund's privatization program.

The operations  and  maintenance  request  maintains  readiness  objectives by supporting a sufficient training tempo, critical training enablers, and the  ongoing Bosnia and Kosovo operations. Operations noblE EaglE , homeland defense activities, and Enduring FrEEdom , the reponse to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, however, were not included in this request. Instead, the Department of Defense will request a supplemental appropriation to cover the costs of those operations in FY 2003.

The FY 2003 request accelerates the pace of the Army's transformation efforts by purchasing the third Stryker Brigade Combat Team. Ninetyseven percent of the science and technology funding will go toward the design and development of the Objective Force. The budget also invests heavily in three key modernization efforts:  the Comanche helicopter, the Crusader self-propelled howitzer, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

In accordance with congressional directives, the Army developed a new methodology to prepare budget requests that accurately reflect operations and maintenance requirements. In the report submitted in July 2002, the Army outlined updated processes that ensure consistency in reporting of tank miles and reflect requirements and execution with more precision. Management controls initiated in FY 2001 to prevent migration of funds allocated for operational tempo to other areas were highly successful and remained in effect during FY 2002.

## Personnel

## Army Strength

The  active  Army's  end  strength  at  30  September  2002  totaled 486,542: 66,446 commissioned officers, 11,712 warrant officers, 404,304 enlisted soldiers,  and  4,080  cadets.  This  was  an  increase  of 5,741 personnel over the FY 2001 final strength. Minorities constituted 41.2 percent of the active Army.  Women constituted 15.3 percent of the active Army.

The Army National guard's end strength at 30 September 2002 totaled 351,078: 29,023 commissioned officers, 7,426 warrant officers, and  314,629  enlisted  soldiers.  This  was  a  decrease  of  751  over  the FY 2001 final  strength.    Minorities  constituted  26.5  percent  of  the Army National guard. Women constituted 12.3 percent of the Army National guard.

The Army Reserve's end strength at 30 September 2002 totaled 206,682:  37,710  commissioned  officers,  2,714  warrant  officers,  and 166,258 enlisted soldiers. This was an increase of 1,054 over the FY 2001 final strength.  Minorities constituted 41.2 percent of the Army Reserve. Women constituted 24.7 percent of the Army Reserve.

## Enlisted Personnel

In  FY  2002,  the  Army  exceeded  its  recruiting  objectives  and exceeded all its enlisted retention goals ( Tables 3 and 4 ).  The  Army met or exceeded its quality standards in recruiting. Of new soldiers, 91 percent had a high school diploma, 68 percent scored in the top fiftieth  percentile  on  the  Armed Forces Qualification Test, and only 1.4  percent  scored  in  Category  IV  of  the  test,  the  lowest  category permitted to enlist.

The  Army  increased  funding  for  the  Selective  Reenlistment Bonus program by $23 million, to a total of $110 million, in order to prevent losses in critical and technical skills that were becoming harder to retain because of job opportunities for these skills in the civilian sector. The Targeted Selective Reenlistment Bonus program was successful in bolstering retention in Korea and at eleven locations

in the United States. There were 45,946 promotions allocated during the fiscal year: 23,877 to sergeant, 12,481 to staff sergeant, 6,517 to sergeant  first  class,  2,542  to  master  sergeant,  and  529  to  sergeant major.

The g-1 approved several changes regarding enlisted promotions. Soldiers now have one year from the effective date of promotion to complete  the  appropriate  level  of  the  Noncommissioned  Officer education  System,  along  with  a  one-time,  six-month  extension. Soldiers who fail to complete the suitable level will be administratively reduced in rank. Commanders at advanced individual training centers can give meritorious promotions to PV 2 to up to 3 percent of PV 1s without regard to time-in-service requirements.

The  Army  separated  79,038  enlisted  soldiers  from  active  duty for administrative reasons, for physical disability, and for retirement. Rationale for separation that showed an increase during the fiscal year included  misconduct,  failure  at  alcohol  or  drug  rehabilitation,  and voluntary administrative discharge in lieu of court-martial. Reasons for separation that showed a decrease included defective enlistment, hardship or dependency, and homosexual conduct. During the year,

the  Army  modified  its  previous  policy  on  allowing  commanders  to decide whether or not to initiate separation proceedings on soldiers with less than three years of service and below the rank of sergeant who committed a single drug offense. Under the new policy, commanders must start separation proceedings for all soldiers with a single drug offense,  and  the  separation  authority  for  that  soldier  will  decide whether to direct retention or discharge.

Several  initiatives  during  FY  2002  reflected  concern  over  the recruitment  and  retention  of  Special  Forces  soldiers.  During  the fiscal year, the Army began recruiting nonprior service volunteers for enlistment in Special Forces. These civilians would have to complete basic  training,  airborne  training,  the  special  operations  preparation course, the Special Forces assessment and selection course, and finally the  Special  Forces  qualification  course.  The  first  of  400  volunteers reported  to  basic  training  in  April  2002.  Three  out  of  every  ten volunteers are expected to complete the two-year process, and these soldiers  are  to  begin  reporting  to  Special  Forces  groups  in  January 2004. In January 2002, the Total Army Personnel Command permitted infantry  soldiers  undergoing  one-station  training  at  Fort  Benning, georgia, to volunteer for the Jump Start Initiative. This project was a one-time effort to provide a limited but immediate pool of qualified candidates to the nonprior service Special Forces enlistment program. Approximately 300 soldiers volunteered for the Jump Start Initiative, and 212 were enrolled in the special operations preparatory course.

The  g-1  approved  a  request  from  the  commander  of  the  U.S. Army  Special  Operations  Command  to  prohibit  Special  Forces noncommissioned  officers  from  terminating  their  Special  Forces status for reasons other than medical or disciplinary while stop-loss provisions remain in effect. The g-1 also approved offering a critical skills retention bonus to Special Forces noncommissioned officers with between twenty and twenty-five  years  of  active  federal  service.  The special duty pay for the Special Forces career management field was increased from $110 to $220 per month, to go into effect at the start of FY 2003.

Although the number of Hispanic enlisted soldiers has increased in recent years, Hispanics are still underrepresented in the Army relative to  their  share  of  the  American  population.  Recruiting  Command implemented  the  Foreign  Language  Recruiting  Initiative  to  help eliminate  this  gap.  This  two-year  pilot  program,  started  in  January 2002, is designed to increase the number of Hispanics in the Army. The Army will select 200 Spanish-speaking recruits per year during the  program  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis.  Those  selected  may score up to ten points below the normal minimum score on the Armed

Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, provided that they score in the upper half of the Spanish Wonderlic Personnel Test, a cognitive test used by civilian businesses. After testing, these recruits will be sent to the Defense Language Institute for up to seven months of englishlanguage training. Those who then pass english comprehension tests will be sent to basic training.

## Officer Personnel

The active Army faced a serious shortage of basic-branch captains during the year. It needed nearly 16,500 but had only about 15,300. In  response,  in  early  2002  the  timing  for  promotion  to  captain  was reduced  from  forty-two  to  thirty-eight  months.  In  June  2002,  the g-1 announced a new policy whereby active Army lieutenants who did  not  hold  Regular  Army  commissions,  and  who  were  scheduled to leave active duty within the next year, would be granted automatic active  duty  service  extensions  so  that  they  could  be  considered  by the  captains'  selection  board  scheduled  to  meet  in  November  2002. Officers selected by the board were offered voluntary indefinite status. Affected lieutenants who desired to separate from active duty would have to submit a memo declining the extension.

Over  the  last  several  years,  the  Army  had  gradually  increased the number of lieutenants programmed to graduate from the Officer Candidate  School  at  Fort  Benning,  georgia.  In  1997,  the  school's mission was 500 graduates. In early 2002, the Army set the school's mission  as  commissioning  1,452  second  lieutenants.  This  increase was necessary because of a continuing slump in the number of basicbranch lieutenants commissioned  through  the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.

During FY 2002, the Army completed the integration of its active duty  field-grade  officers  into  the  Officer  Personnel  Management System XXI. Under this new system, once officers are promoted to major,  they  are  assigned  to  one  of  four  career  fields:  institutional support, information operations, operational support, or operations. About 75 percent of the officers are assigned to the operations career field and remain in their basic branch's career pattern. The remaining officers  assigned  to  other  career  fields  are  assigned  to  one  of  the functional areas within each field and will have training, education, and assignment patterns  distinctive  to  that  career  field.  Field-grade officers will now only compete for promotions against other officers in their career field.

In July 2002, the Army Training and Leader Development Panel issued its report on the state of training and leader development in

the  Army's  corps  of  warrant  officers.  The  panel  made  sixty-three recommendations grouped into four major categories: Army culture, training  and  education,  manning,  and  professional  development. In  Army  culture  the  panel  recommended  fully  integrating  warrant officers into the officer corps; clarifying and publishing the role of the warrant officer, by pay grade, in the Army; and managing, educating, and assigning warrant officers to the specific needs and requirements of their branch. In training and education the panel concluded that the current Warrant Officer education System did not meet the needs of the Army and warrant officers. The quality and quantity of technical education and training must improve dramatically. Furthermore, the Warrant Officer education System should become a specialized subset of the Officer education System rather than a stand-alone operation. In manning, the panel recommended that the service revise its methods of  recruiting  and  retaining  warrant  officers  into  a  unified  effort  for the total Army, rather than disparate, under-funded operations in the active component, the Army Reserve, and the Army National guard. For professional development, the panel recommended a number of changes to the professional development process for warrant officers.

## Civilian Personnel

In FY 2002, the Army's civilian personnel strength was 277,786. There are approximately 150 civilians deployed in support of the war on terrorism in Operation Enduring FrEEdom .    In  any  given  week fifty or more Army civilians served beside soldiers in the Balkans as part of Operations JoinT guardian and JoinT ForgE .

The  average  age  and  tenure  of  the  Army  civilian  has  increased since  the  post-Cold  War  drawdown  began.  Average  age  increased from forty-three in FY 1989 to forty-eight in FY 2002. Average years of service increased from 13.5 in FY 1989 to 18 in FY 2002. There were 21,409 retirement-eligible Army civilians at the end of FY 2002. This represented 10.8 percent of the workforce. This is an increase in both absolute numbers (there were 18,544 eligible in FY 2001) and in percentage of workforce (9.5 percent in FY 2001).

As  a  comprehensive  effort  to  consolidate  and  more  effectively manage  the  force,  the  Army  started  an  initiative  to  transform  the civilian  personnel  system.  High-quality,  well-trained  civilians  are absolutely essential to the readiness of the force and to the ability to sustain operations today and in the future. Aggressive transformation of the civilian force-in which projections through FY 2005 indicate a 16 percent annual turnover due to retirements and other losses-will ensure the Army continues to meet those obligations. To forecast future

civilian  workforce  needs  with  precision,  the  Army  uses  the  Civilian Forecasting  System,  a  sophisticated  projection  model  that  predicts future civilian personnel requirements under various scenarios.

During the Persian gulf War, there was not a centralized automated method for tracking civilian employees sent to the theater in support of deployed forces. On 31 May 2002, Headquarters, Department of the Army, implemented a new Web-based deployed civilian employee tracking system called CIVTRACKS. Although designed for Department of the Army employees, accountability for other civilians in a theater of operations can be maintained using CIVTRACKS, such as Department of Defense contractors, Army and Air Force exchange Service (AAFeS) personnel, and members of the Red Cross.

## Special Topics

In FY 2000, FY 2001, and FY 2002, the Army was able to man all its divisions and armored cavalry regiments at 100 percent aggregate fill.  In  FY  2001  and  FY  2002,  it  also  achieved  the  same  goal  with selected early deploying units. In none of these years, however, has it been able to meet the Chief of Staff of the Army's directive to fill units with  their  authorized  grades  and  Military  Occupational  Specialties (MOSs), forcing units to assign some soldiers to positions for which they do not have the required grade or MOS. Available manpower has limited the Army to filling these units with only about 90 percent of their authorized strength by grade and MOS.

To  support  Operations noblE  EaglE and Enduring  FrEEdom , the Army issued several stop-loss orders during the fiscal year. Stoploss is a program that allows the service to retain soldiers-who are determined  to  be  essential  to  the  national  security  of  the  United States-on active duty for an open-ended period beyond their date of  retirement,  separation,  or  release.  Not  covered  by  the  program are soldiers eligible for mandatory retirement, eligible for retirement or  separation  for  physical  disability,  those  awaiting  separation  for improper behavior, and those for whom continued active duty would cause extreme hardship.

The first stop-loss message, in December 2001, affected members of the active Army in Special Forces, warrant officer helicopter pilots, and CH-47 helicopter mechanics. The second message, in January 2002, covered reserve component soldiers in Special Forces, warrant officer helicopter pilots, psychological operations and civil affairs specialists, and mortuary affairs specialists. The third stop-loss message, also in January 2002, added all active Army military police and most military intelligence commissioned  officers,  warrant  officers,  and  enlisted

personnel.  Later  in  the  year,  several  field  artillery  and  air  defense artillery military occupational specialties, along with unmanned aerial vehicle  operators,  explosive  ordnance  technicians,  and  prime  power production specialists were added to stop-loss. By the end of the fiscal year,  stop-loss  had  affected  approximately  fifty-one  thousand  active Army, Army National guard, and Army Reserve soldiers.

Initially,  the  stop-loss  orders  had  been  open-ended.  This  had  a negative  effect  on  morale,  and,  in  September  2002,  the  Army  g-1 announced an end to that policy. Instead, soldiers affected by stoploss  would  be  permitted  to  leave  active  duty  or  separate  from  the service twelve months from the end of their original obligation. Those personnel who had already completed their original obligation would be  allowed  to  leave  twelve  months  from  the  date  they  were  placed under stop-loss.

In  October  2001,  the  Total  Army  Personnel  Command  fielded the Assignment Satisfaction Key (ASK) after a five-year development process. This system was created in response to a requirement in the Army Family Action Plan that the service allows enlisted personnel to become more involved in managing their careers. The Assignment Satisfaction  Key  is  a  Web  application  that  permits  soldiers  to  post their assignment preferences and other information about themselves in  the  same  database  used  by  career  managers  at  the  Total  Army Personnel Command when making job decisions. In September 2002, TAPC introduced the Assignment Satisfaction Report to gauge how well career managers match assignments with soldiers' preferences as recorded by ASK. A similar program for officers was fielded in July 2002.

During FY 2002, the Total Army Personnel Command incrementally fielded the Personnel electronic Records Management System's  online  official military personnel  file application. This application  allows  soldiers  to  view  their  official  personnel  file  via  a standard Web browser. In the past, many soldiers traveled to TAPC's records centers, at their own expense, before selection boards met to ensure that their files were accurate and updated. electronic versions of personnel files also reduce the records centers' workloads, particularly in regards to supporting selection boards. By January 2002, the system covered  all  soldiers  of  the  active  Army.  It  was  extended  to  Army National guard officers the next month and to all members of the Army Reserve in July 2002.

The Army continued implementation of its Well-Being Strategic Plan,  issued  in  January  2001.  Well-being  is  the  personal  (physical, material,  mental,  and  spiritual)  state  of  soldiers,  Department  of the  Army  civilian  employees,  veterans,  retirees,  and  their  families.

The Army takes a deep interest in the personal state of its members because of how it can affect their ability to carry out their duties. The primary difference between what was once called quality of life and well-being is that well-being seeks to integrate the mutually supporting demands and expectations of the Army and its people. The Army Staff developed fifty functions over the past two years to organize services and programs that contribute to well-being and readiness.

In  March  2002,  the  Army  announced  that  five  well-being  labs would  be  established  by  June  2002.  The  installations  selected  were Aberdeen Proving ground, Maryland; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort  Jackson,  South  Carolina;  2d  Infantry  Division,  Republic  of Korea;  and  the  26th  Area  Support  group,  germany.  The  labs  will research, develop, and implement a program designed to maximize the well-being of soldiers, civilians, and families through actions taken at the  installation  and  community  levels;  identify  community  member perceptions  of  well-being  products  and  services;  and  analyze  the results and recommend actions for Army-wide implementation.

In  FY  2002,  399  active  duty  soldiers  died.  eleven  soldiers  were killed in action or died of wounds sustained in action.  eighty-one died from  illness,  twenty-one  were  murdered,  sixty-six  killed  themselves, one hundred and ninety-seven died in accidents, and in twenty-one cases cause of death was undetermined.

In November 2000, the Chief of Staff of the Army directed that the  black  beret,  previously  worn  by  members  of  the  75th  Ranger Regiment, be adopted Army-wide effective 14 June 2001. Sufficient berets were available by that date to provide every soldier one beret. The  active  Army  and  mobilized  Army  National  guard  and  Army Reserve soldiers received their second black beret in April 2002.  Army National guard and Army Reserve soldiers not mobilized will receive their second beret in FY 2003.

On 4 July 2002, the Army released the computer game America's Army as  part  of  the  Army game Project. The project is a new tool in  the  service's  recruiting  effort  and  is  distributed  by  the  service  for free. Its purpose is to connect directly with young Americans using a pastime that is very popular with them. America's Army consists of two connected components: a first-person-perspective action game and a role-playing,  attribute-building  game.  The  two  components  model the  Army  enlisted  experience  from  recruitment  and  basic  training through unit assignments and real-world missions. In its initial release, the action game component contains only one single enlisted career management field, light infantry. Future versions of this component will present other career management fields that model well in action games.

The new U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas

<!-- image -->

In September 2002, a new U.S. Disciplinary Barracks opened at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Authorized in 1994, construction of the 521bed facility began in June 1998. Located on what had been the prison's farm, the new state-of-the-art disciplinary barracks replaced the old brick-and-stone facility known as the 'The Castle.' Accreditation of the new facility by the American Correctional Association is expected in FY 2003.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Army Organization

The  Army  is  organized  into  two  functionally  discrete  entities known  as  the  operational  Army  and  the  institutional  Army.  In addition to functional distinctions, the Army is described in terms of components. each component is characterized by the source and role of its units and people. There are three components: the Regular Army and two reserve components, the Army National guard and Army Reserve. The Regular Army is a federal force consisting of full-time soldiers. The Army National guard has both federal and state roles. In its federal role, it provides trained units able to mobilize quickly for war and other missions. In its state role, the Army National guard prepares for domestic emergencies and other missions as required by state  law.  The  Army  Reserve  is  the  Army's  primary  federal  reserve force with the principal role of providing the specialized units needed to deploy and sustain Army forces at home and overseas. The Army Reserve is also the service's major source of trained individual soldiers for  augmenting  headquarters  staffs  and  filling  vacancies  in  Regular Army units.

The  operational Army-consisting  of  numbered  units  from army to  company  levels-provides  essential  land  power  capabilities to combatant commanders. The heart of the operational Army is its divisions. The Regular Army has ten: one airborne, one air assault, one infantry, two armored, two light infantry, and three mechanized infantry. The Army National guard has eight divisions: one armored, one light infantry, three infantry, and three mechanized infantry. For special operations the Regular Army has one ranger regiment and five Special Forces groups while the Army National guard has two Special Forces groups.

The institutional Army  supports the operational Army  by providing  the  foundation  necessary  to  design,  raise,  train,  equip, deploy, and ensure the readiness of all Army forces. Major elements of  the  institutional  Army  are  Army  Materiel  Command,  Training

and Doctrine Command, Forces Command, Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Army Intelligence and Security Command, the Corps  of  engineers,  Criminal  Investigation  Command,  Medical Command, National guard Bureau, and Army Reserve Command.

## Blueprint for the Future

In November 2001, the Army published a white paper, Concepts for the Objective Force . This paper articulated the overarching framework for the Objective Force, its operational concept, the characteristics that guided its development, the enablers that would facilitate its fielding, and the critical nature of the human dimension to its development. In February 2002, the Army published the 2002 Army Modernization Plan , which superseded the 2001 version of the plan. This plan provided an update on the Army's efforts to support and implement transformation. It described the modernization and investment strategies adopted by the Army that place priority on pursuing advanced technologies and developing  systems  to  meet  future  requirements,  while  at  the  same time remaining committed to maintaining the readiness of the current force.

The  overall  modernization  strategy  has  three  components.  The first  is  to  accelerate  fielding  of  the  future  Objective  Force  and,  in particular the Future Combat Systems, the foundation of that force. The Objective Force will be organized, manned, equipped, and trained to be more strategically responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable,  and  sustainable  across  the  entire  spectrum  of  military operations  from  major  theater  wars  through  counterterrorism  to homeland  security.  Objective  Force  units  will  conduct  operational maneuvers from strategic distances and will dominate land operations, providing the decisive complement to air, sea, and space operations.

The  second  part  of  the  strategy  is  the  Interim  Force,  designed to  meet  immediate  requirements  to  rapidly  create  a  force  that  can be  used  across  the  full  spectrum  of  possible  operations.  This  part of the strategy is based on the rapid fielding of six brigade combat teams equipped with the Stryker family of new armored vehicles and enhanced  information  technologies.  The  Interim  Force  will  bridge the capabilities gap between the Legacy Force and the arrival of the Objective  Force  and  provide  more  flexible  options  for  the  Army  to support the regional combatant commands.

The third part of the strategy is the Legacy Force. This forcewhich is  expected  to  exist  for  the  next  twenty-five  to  thirty  yearsinvolves maintaining and improving the capabilities of units equipped with current weapon systems through selected modernization efforts.

An important element of the Legacy Force is the requirement for an offensive  or  counteroffensive  capability  for  use  in  a  major  conflict, which  calls for a three-division corps. The  Army  is  selectively modernizing and recapitalizing III Corps (designated as the Army's Counterattack  Corps),  which  consists  of  the  3d  Armored  Cavalry Regiment and three divisions: the 1st Cavalry Division, the 3d Infantry Division, and the 4th Infantry Division. Also included in this effort are those units at echelons above division assigned to III Corps, including reserve component units.

The Army's Transformation Campaign Plan, which is developed, coordinated, and maintained by the Army  g-3, ensures the synchronization  of  the  transformation  process  with  the  day-to-day management of the Army ( Diagram 1 ). It is a three-phased plan, with phases corresponding to the three major objectives. In addition, there are three axes: Trained and Ready, Transform the Operational Army, and Transform the Institutional Army. These serve as the framework for the execution of the plan. These axes are further divided into lines of operation, which provide the ability to synchronize and integrate the transformation effort across the Army.

In  order  to  accelerate  transformation  to  the  future  Objective Force, the Army accepted risk by focusing its modernization efforts on selected units and capabilities. The number one priority for investments is the development of the future Objective Force and particularly the Future  Combat  Systems,  the  foundation  of  the  transformed  Army. Of the Army's total science and technology research funding, over 95 percent directly supports programs needed to develop the Objective Force. The Army is also devoting a substantial and increasing amount of  its  research,  development,  and  acquisition  funding  to  fielding systems that will be integrated in the Objective Force. Fully 20 percent of this funding is directly earmarked for systems that will be essential to the Objective Force. Over 50 percent of this funding is designated for Legacy Force systems that will transition to and remain part of the Objective Force, while only 16 percent of this funding will be used by systems associated solely with the Legacy Force. The preponderance of funding focused on the Objective Force will continue to increase over time as the Army progresses in the transformation process. The focus on the future force is, in fact, enabled by the Army's continued investment in the readiness and capability of the Legacy Force and in the fielding of the smaller Interim Force, for which about 4 percent of research, development, and acquisition funding is devoted.

On 18-19 September 2002, the Army's senior leadership met for an Objective Force midcourse review. This meeting provided senior leaders  an  update  and  assessment  of  the  Army's  transformation

efforts  toward  fielding  initial  Objective  Force  capabilities  in  this decade. Furthermore, it afforded senior leaders the opportunity to provide midcourse guidance for these endeavors, and it identified the way ahead for the Objective Force and the means to get there. The review approved the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's conceptual underpinnings for the Objective Force, the Future Combat Systems acquisition concept, the Objective Force architecture concepts  and  timelines,  the  Objective  Force  sustainment  concepts and timelines, the Objective Force personnel concepts and timelines, and the way ahead for the Objective Force. The approved way ahead included  forming  a  general  Officer  Steering  group  for  Priorities (g-3),  Programs  (g-8),  and  Synchronization  (Director,  Objective Force task force) to guide the development of the critical path for creating irreversible momentum toward fielding the Objective Force to provide oversight of the Army Transformation Roadmap and the Army Transformation Campaign Plan.

## Force Development

On  27  February  2002,  the  Army  officially  named  the  Interim Force's medium-weight armored vehicle the Stryker after two unrelated infantrymen with the same last name who had both received the Medal of Honor. The first Strykers arrived at Fort Lewis, Washington, on 31 May 2002. The arrival of the Strykers inaugurated a series of training

and  test  challenges  oriented  toward  making  the  first  Interim  Force brigade (3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division) ready for deployment. On 1  July  the  Interim  Brigade  Combat  Team  was  renamed  the  Stryker Brigade Combat Team.

The first major opportunity for the Stryker brigade to demonstrate its  new vehicle and the operational concepts it employs was the Joint Forces  Command-sponsored millEnnium  challEngE 2002  exercise at Fort Irwin, California. For the demonstration, the unit deployed a complete  company  and  various  support  attachments  to  accomplish brigade-level tasks involving both simulated and actual units. Although millEnnium challEngE 2002 demonstrated the brigade's capabilities on  a  small  scale  and  minor  problems  with  equipment  occurred,  the units that deployed did well in the exercise. The 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, is expected to be certified as ready for deployment in FY 2003.

## Training

Transformation  required  making  changes  to  the  way  the  Army trained and developed its leaders, as well as fielding new equipment, organizations, and doctrine. In June 2000, the Chief of Staff of the Army established the Army Training and Leader Development Panel; its mission was to examine training and leader development as part of the Army's transformation effort. In May 2001, the panel released its report concerning commissioned officers. The report concluded that there were serious shortcomings in the officer corps stemming from the fact that there was a pervasive failure to follow doctrine concerning leadership  and  training  management.  Furthermore,  it  found  that the officer education system 'does not satisfactorily train officers in combined  arms  skills  or  support  the  bonding,  cohesion,  and  rapid teaming required in full spectrum operations.'

Based on recommendations in the panel's report, the Army began making major changes to the officer education system. Branch basic courses  for  new  lieutenants  will  be  replaced  by  a  two-phased  Basic Officer Leaders Course (BOLC). BOLC phase one will provide smallunit  combat training to all second lieutenants at a central location, with an emphasis on practical exercises in the field, in order to establish a common standard for officership and small-unit leadership. BOLC phase two will provide platoon-level, branch-specific training in the tactical and technical skills needed by new lieutenants. The length of the two-phased BOLC will not exceed the existing twenty-week officer basic courses.

This requirement created some concern at the branch schools because it forced them to squeeze nineteen weeks of instruction into a new Basic

Officer Leaders Course phase two of thirteen weeks. The schools had to look for inefficiencies in the existing program of instruction, had to find opportunities to add more field training or hands-on training for more rigor,  and had to recognize that time restraints would prevent training some skills to past standards. Priorities had to be established so that the most important skills would be trained to the desired level. A pilot program for phase one of the course began during FY 2001 and was joined by pilot programs for phase two during FY 2002. The transition from officer basic courses to BOLC is targeted for completion during FY 2004.

The panel also recommended eliminating the current method for selecting and educating officers at the Command and general Staff College. For the existing course the Army uses a central selection process to identify the top 50 percent of the majors in each year group. These majors then attend the ten-month resident course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The rest complete a nonresident education program to receive their  field-grade  education.  The  new  Intermediate-Level  education program  will  give  all  majors  a  common  core  of  Army  operational instruction  of  approximately  three  months.  Career  field,  branch,  or functional area education will follow the common core training and be tailored to prepare officers for future service in the Army. Lengths and  locations  will  vary  depending  on  the  educational  requirements of their career fields or the functional areas. This Intermediate-Level education program will end the current practice of using educational opportunities as a discriminator for branch qualification, promotion, and command selection. The pilot programs began in FY 2002, and full implementation is projected for FY 2005.

In April 2002, the Army Training and Leader Development Panel issued its report on the state of training and leader development in the Army's noncommissioned officer corps.  The panel's major findings include: a need to improve the Noncommissioned Officer education System, a need to devote more resources to training noncommissioned officers,  and  the  existence  of  a  climate  of  micromanagement  that impedes  the  ability  of  noncommissioned  officers  to  perform  their duties and  further  their professional  development.  The  report presented  seventy-eight  findings  and  recommendations  extending across  six  imperatives:  Army  culture,  Noncommissioned  Officer education System, training, systems approach to training, training and leader development model, and lifelong learning.

## Deployed Operational Forces

The  terrorist  organization  known  as  al-Qaeda-perpetrator  of the  11  September  2001  attack-used  Afghanistan  as  a  safe  haven

and training ground.  Military action in Afghanistan quickly became the focus of Operation Enduring FrEEdom , the code name given to America's response to the terrorist attack. U.S. forces began arriving at an air base in south-central Uzbekistan in the fall of 2001. From there, in October 2001, Army Special Forces teams were inserted into the  country  with  the  mission  of  contacting  leaders  of  anti-Taliban forces, coordinating their activities in a series of offensives, bringing U.S. airpower to bear on Taliban and al-Qaeda forces, and changing the government of Afghanistan so that the country was no longer a safe haven for terrorists. On 14 November 2001, the capital, Kabul, fell to Northern Alliance forces assisted by Army Special Forces teams and American airpower.

While  special  operations  forces  fought  alongside  the  Northern Alliance, the U.S. Central Command established the theater architecture  to  command  and  control  a  sustained  land  campaign. In October 2001, it designated the U.S. Third Army-Army Central-to  provide  command  and  control  for  ongoing  operations as  the  Combined  Forces  Land  Component  Command  (CFLCC). Third Army headquarters deployed to egypt just days prior to the terrorist attack to provide oversight of the brighT sTar exercise. On 13 November, the headquarters moved from egypt to Camp Doha, Kuwait, where it officially assumed responsibilities as the Combined Forces  Land Component Command on 20 November. The mission of CFLCC was to direct and synchronize land operations to destroy al-Qaeda  and  prevent  the  reemergence  of  international  terrorist activities in Combined Joint Area-Afghanistan, as well as to conduct humanitarian operations and create conditions for a peaceful, stable Afghanistan.

In order for the Combined Forces Land Component Command to accomplish its mission, additional Army forces were deployed to the gulf region and Central Asia to support Operation Enduring FrEEdom. These forces included engineer, intelligence, military police, civil affairs, and logistics units. The buildup of forces in Central Asia led CFLCC to request the equivalent of a division tactical command post to serve as the CFLCC (Forward) headquarters closer to the actual fighting. On 25 November the 10th Mountain Division a light infantry division, stationed at Fort Drum, New York, received orders to deploy a command post to Central Asia to serve as the CFLCC (Forward) headquarters. Also deployed from Fort Drum was one of the division's brigades. On 12 December the 10th Mountain Division headquarters officially assumed duties as the CFLCC (Forward)or  Task  Force mounTain -at  Karshi-Khanabad,  Uzbekistan.  In February  2002,  Task  Force mounTain moved  into  Afghanistan

and  established  a  headquarters  at  Bagram  Air  Field.  The  mission of CFLCC (Forward) was to command and control Army forcesless special operations forces-in the Combined and Joint Area of Operations, Afghanistan. In April 2002, Central Command placed the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force under the tactical control of Task Force mounTain .

After the fall of Kabul, al-Qaeda and Taliban forces retreated into major  strongholds  in  the  Tora  Bora  Mountains  south  of  Jalalabad near  the  Pakistani  border.  Special  Forces  teams  and  anti-Taliban forces moved into the area. By the time the Tora Bora fighting slowly ground to a halt in mid-December, a few al-Qaeda were captured, but most of them fought to the death or slipped away into the relative safety of nearby Pakistan. With the capture of Kabul and Kandahar and the destruction of organized resistance in Tora Bora, Afghanistan was now in effect liberated. U.S. Army forces, augmented by the newly arrived 3d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, still had to find an elusive and potentially deadly residual guerrilla force, assess the humanitarian situation in their local areas, coordinate allied humanitarian initiatives, gather intelligence on al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants, and ensure that liaison was established with the newly emerging Afghan government.

In April 2002, Central Command decided to create a corps-level headquarters in Afghanistan to simplify and clarify the multiple lines of authority in the theater. Selected for this mission was the XVIII Airborne Corps, which was designated Combined Joint Task Force180 (CJTF-180). As originally organized, a combined joint task force included  nearly  one  thousand  staff  positions.  In  order  to  meet  the restrictions placed by the Secretary of Defense on the numbers of Army personnel allowed in Afghanistan, the XVIII Airborne Corps arrived at Bagram Air Field in May 2002 with only 365 personnel. Members of  the  U.S.  Army,  Air  Force,  and  Marine  Corps-as  well  as  those from several coalition partners-rounded out the headquarters staff. The transfer of authority from Task Force mounTain to  Combined Joint  Task  Force-180  occurred  at  midnight  on  1  June  2002.  CJTF180 incorporated Task Force mounTain into its command structureCJTF-180 took over the political-military responsibilities, worked with the  Afghan  government,  and  dealt  with  the  neighboring  countries, while  Task  Force mounTain served  as  the  tactical  headquarters  for combat operations.  With  Combined  Joint  Task  Force-180  in  place, the bulk of Third Army's personnel serving in the Combined Forces Land Component Command returned to the United States, leaving a small staff in Kuwait to handle CFLCC's support responsibilities in the theater.

Central Command ordered the Combined Joint Task Force-180 to destroy the remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in Afghanistan. It was also directed to train the Afghan National Army and to conduct operations  to  stabilize  and  secure  Afghanistan  so  that  terrorism could not reemerge there. During the spring and summer of 2002, the brigades  from  the  10th  Mountain  Division  and  the  101st  Airborne Division returned to the United States, replaced by elements of the 82d Airborne Division as the main maneuver force in the theater. This force-designated Combined Task Force-82-assumed responsibility for tactical operations from Task Force mounTain ,  while Combined Joint Task Force-180 focused on stability and reconstruction, politicalmilitary issues, and assistance to the Afghan government. Operations in Afghanistan continued through the end of FY 2002.

The  2d  Brigade,  1st  Cavalry  Division,  deployed  to  Kuwait  as part  of  Operation Enduring  FrEEdom .  It  prepared  and  deployed in November 2001, fourteen days after notification, and returned to Fort Hood, Texas, in early April 2002. The 3d Brigade, 3d Infantry Division, replaced it in Kuwait.

The Army continued during FY 2002 to maintain the Patriot air defense task force in the Persian gulf. This task force, established after Operation dEsErT  sTorm in  1991,  defends  American  and  coalition

forces  against  the  threat  of  Iraqi  ballistic  missiles.  The  task  force  is comprised  of  elements  of  an  air  defense  artillery  battalion  and  an attached  infantry  company,  which  provides  ground  security.  These units deploy to the gulf for a temporary duty rotation of 120 days.

## Possible Operations in Iraq

After the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Army began to expend more effort on planning and preparing for a possible invasion of Iraq. The focus of this effort was Third Army headquarters, which would again assume the role of Combined Forces Land Component Command for Central Command during any operations in Iraq. In June 2002, the Department of Defense assigned the Army the mission of training a force of up to five thousand Iraqi exiles and expatriates to aid U.S. forces should an invasion of Iraq become necessary. Planning for this mission by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command continued through the end of FY 2002.

## Army National Guard

## Personnel Management

To reach an Army National guard end strength goal of 350,000, enlisted  gains  were  programmed at 60,504 and officer gains at 3,608. The guard finished FY 2002 with 63,251 accessions or 104 percent of the goal. It programmed nonprior service and prior service accessions at a fifty-fifty mix and completed the year with 32,811 nonprior service accessions  and  30,440  prior  service  accessions.  The  Army  National guard  continues  to  lead  the  reserve  components  with  the  lowest overall attrition rate at 19.3 percent. This success can be credited to an increased command emphasis on using existing attrition programs and the awareness that has been placed on attrition management at all levels.

## Training and Readiness

Fourteen of the fifteen enhanced separate brigades in the Army National  guard  met  the  required  readiness  criteria  dictated  by  the Defense Planning guidance. Readiness within Army National guard divisions declined slightly in FY 2002 due to the increased operational tempo created by mobilizations and deployments, as well as by the lack of full-time support personnel. As a result of the decline in training readiness  within  the  divisions,  post-mobilization  training  levels  and the overall preparedness of these units remain below acceptable levels.

## Mobilization

More than eight thousand national guardsmen deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring FrEEdom during FY 2002. They served in Afghanistan, provided force protection in europe, and conducted detainee  operations  in  Cuba.  The  Army  National  guard  provided more than ten thousand soldiers for force protection missions to major U.S. Army commands and border security missions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service. It supported homeland security missions, guarding airports, nuclear power plants, domestic water supplies, bridges, tunnels, and military assets. National

guardsmen secured the Pentagon after the 11 September 2011 attack and provided continuous support to local authorities at the site of the World Trade Center. Across the country, the Army National guard responded to 263 requests for assistance. Security was given special emphasis at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was designated a National Special Security event. As part of this security effort, national guardsmen from twenty-five different states provided security  force,  chemical  and  biological  detection,  radar,  aviation, transportation,  communication,  military  police,  explosive  ordnance disposal, and nine troop life support areas. At its peak, more than five thousand guardsmen were on duty. By the end of the year the Army National guard expended 645,419 man-days in assistance to civilian authorities.

In FY 2002, the Army National guard deployed 6,697 personnel to  support  operations  in  Bosnia,  Kosovo,  Macedonia,  Kuwait,  and Saudi  Arabia.  An  additional  22,483  soldiers  conducted  combatant command mission support and training events in eighty-three other countries.  Six  brigades  and  numerous  battalion  and  smaller  sized units  participated  in  rotations  in  Southwest  Asia  during  the  fiscal year. National guardsmen provided attack aviation task force mission support in Kuwait as well as infantry force protection support to the air defense artillery units in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

In December 2000, the Army decided that over the course of the next  two  years  it  would  turn  over  responsibility  for  supplying  units for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia to the Army National guard. In  September  2002,  the  Army  National  guard  provided  the  forces, including headquarters, for the first time. elements of the 28th Infantry Division, a mechanized division of the Pennsylvania Army National guard, totaling approximately fifteen hundred soldiers, deployed for this mission.

To free up active Army units for operations elsewhere after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack, the Army National guard took over responsibility for the Multinational Force and Observers commitment in the Sinai. elements of the 39th Infantry Brigade (Arkansas Army National  guard)  mobilized  in  October  2001  and,  after  training, deployed to egypt in January 2002 for a six-month rotation. In July 2002, elements of the 41st Infantry Brigade (Oregon Army National guard) relieved them.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The depot maintenance program continues to be an integral part of Army National guard sustainment. This program is based on a 'repair

and return to user' premise as opposed to an equipment maintenance 'float'  system.  Unlike  the  active  Army,  the  Army  National  guard does not have a quantity of selected end items authorized to use as immediate replacements by units when critical equipment is returned to the depot for repair. Funding for the Army National guard's depot maintenance  requirement  increased  slightly  from  77  percent  in  FY 2001 to 80 percent FY 2002. equipment qualifying for depot repair increased by 11 percent during FY 2002, which is attributed primarily to an acceleration of the Army National guard's aviation modernization programs and the rebuilding of an aged tactical wheeled vehicle fleet.

Due to the large number of aviation units still equipped with legacy or substitute aircraft, the Army National guard aviation structure went through sweeping changes at all levels during FY 2002. Not only were an additional ninety-nine modernized aircraft (eighty-nine UH-60 and ten AH-64) added to the Army National guard's total inventory, but the guard converted the basic organizational structure of the majority of its aviation units to new aviation transformation designs effective September 2002. Unfortunately, the anticipated funding level for the supporting fielding items (tool sets, kits, test equipment, and parts) did not keep pace with the aircraft transfers and restricted the ability of the receiving units to fully utilize the new aircraft.

In FY 2002, three divisional brigades received the M2A2 Bradley and one enhanced separate brigade received the M2A2ODS Bradley.

A variety of shortages in the ground forces persist, such as tactical wheeled vehicles, SINCgARS radios, rotary wing aircraft, night vision devices, and engineer equipment.

## Management and Planning

The Secretary  of  the  Army  and  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  approved a logistics transformation plan developed by Army Materiel Command. The plan is part of Army Materiel Command's efforts to streamline its operations and contained both short- and long-term recommendations. One  initiative  will  create  a  more  centralized  research,  development, and engineering command within Army Materiel Command, bringing together the service's laboratories, research, development, and engineering centers,  and  the  Army  Materiel  Systems  Analysis  Agency.  Another proposal  is  to  create  an  Army  Field  Support  Command,  also  under Army  Materiel  Command,  to  provide  'factory  to  foxhole'  logistical support. The plan seeks to decrease the ratio of combat arms soldiers to logisticians and maintenance personnel in units. Forty of the Army's fifty-five national maintenance repair program sites would be closed, and the Army would place more reliance on the Defense Logistics Agency's strategic distribution  programs  to  ensure  that  supplies,  equipment, parts,  and  tools  are  available  when  needed.  A  longer-term  objective  is to develop a 'pit-stop engineering' approach to maintenance modeled on the automobile racing industry, designing systems to allow for easy access with only a few tools. Another proposal would require contractors doing logistical and maintenance work on certain systems to be members of the reserve components so that they could deploy, as reservists, with the unit they support as civilians. Army Materiel Command expects to brief the service's senior leaders in the second quarter of FY 2003 on the implementation of this plan.

Recapitalization is the rebuilding and selected upgrading of currently fielded systems to ensure operational readiness. Since the Army skipped a procurement generation in the 1990s, the ages of many of the current force's combat systems often exceed their expected service lives (twenty years for most active Army systems and thirty years for systems used by the Army National guard). Rebuilding restores a system to a like-new condition in appearance, performance, and life expectancy. It inserts new technology  when  practical  to  improve  reliability  and  maintainability . Selected upgrading rebuilds the system and adds capability improvements

that address shortcomings. The result of a selected upgrade is a system with a new model and a new life and improved operational capability. Recapitalization  includes  preplanned  product  improvements,  extended service programs, and major modifications.

The  Army has  established  a  plan,  management  structure,  and immediate  milestones  for  the  implementation  of  the  recapitalization program.  There  are  seventeen  systems  in  the  program:  Abrams  tank; AH-64  helicopter;  UH-60  helicopter;  CH-47  helicopter;  M88A1/A2 recovery  vehicle;  M48/M60  armored  vehicle  launch  bridge  recovery vehicle; M9 armored combat earthmover; M2A3/M3A3 Bradley fighting vehicle;  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System;  Patriot  air  defense  missile system; M113 family of vehicles; heavy expanded mobility tactical truck; small emplacement excavator; Firefinder Radar AN/TSQ-36; electronic shops;  M992V2  field  artillery  ammunition  support  vehicle;  and  highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV or Humvee).

There  have  been  no  policy  changes  since  the  Army  Acquisition executive  and  the  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  published  the Recapitalization Program Policy Letter in April 2001. The program has focused its resources on systems used by the Interim Force and by III Corps, which in its role as the counterattack corps, is the key component of the Legacy Force. The Army has taken a risk in this decision, as projected funding shortfalls in future fiscal years mean that the remaining active Army, Army Reserve, and Army National guard units may not benefit from the recapitalization program.

On 7 June 2002, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics,  and  Technology  activated  Program  executive  Office  (PeO) Soldier at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The mission of PeO Soldier is to focus directly  on  the  soldier  as  the  central  component  of  the  Army's  most important weapon system. It has the responsibility to develop, field, and sustain  virtually  everything  a  soldier  wears,  carries,  or  operates.  PeO Soldier  integrated  346  Acquisition  Category  I,  II,  and  III  programs, under the purview of three project managers. Project Manager Soldier Weapons works on the development and production of current and future weapon  systems,  ammunition,  and  associated  target  acquisition  and fire  control  products. Two product managers support Project Manager Soldier  Weapons-Product Manager Crew Served Weapons Programs and Product Manager Individual Weapons Programs. Project Manager Soldier Warrior supports soldiers through the acquisition of all systems in  four  areas:  soldier  lethality,  survivability,  mobility,  and  sustainment. Two  product  managers  support  Project  Manager  Soldier  WarriorProduct  Manager  Air  Warrior  and  Product  Manager  Land  Warrior. Project Manager Soldier equipment provides advanced technologies for night  vision  devices,  man-portable  laser  systems  for  range-finding  and

designating, as well as working on the soldier's clothing and individual equipment.  Two  product  managers  support  Project  Manager  Soldier equipment-Product  Manager  Sensors  and  Lasers  Programs  and Product Manager Clothing and Individual equipment Programs.

The Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) program consists of brigade and unit sets of equipment, operational projects, and sustainment stocks pre-positioned afloat and on land around the world. It also includes war reserve stocks for allies in Korea, Thailand, and Israel. In FY 2002, seven armored brigade sets were pre-positioned: six on land (three in europe, two in Southwest Asia, and one in Korea) and one afloat. Another brigade will be put afloat in FY 2003. Operational projects provide specialized capabilities, such as base camp support. Sustainment stocks support APS unit sets and initial deploying units in Southwest Asia and Korea until resupply is initiated from the continental United States.

In  FY  2002  the  Army  Pre-positioned  Stocks-2  Reconfiguration Initiative,  initially  approved  by  the  Army  Requirements  Oversight Council in August 2001, was implemented to make this stockpile more strategically responsive. Under this plan, APS-2 will be reduced from three armored brigade sets to one brigade set specifically configured to support U.S. european Command contingency requirements. This change is expected to be completed in October 2002. excess stocks will be redistributed to APS-3, APS-4, and APS-5, as well as to U.S. Army, europe, and Army National guard units. The upload of the second brigade afloat to APS-3 has been delayed to FY 2003 because of support for operations in the U.S. Central Command area. Seven of eight Large Medium-Speed Roll-on/Roll-off Ships and three of four container ships in APS-3 were transferred in support of Operation Enduring FrEEdom . Operational projects played key roles in supporting Army units deployed for Operation Enduring FrEEdom . For example, all force provider modules were deployed to Afghanistan, Kuwait, or Qatar to provide living accommodations for soldiers. Over sixty large area maintenance shelters, nineteen sets of aircraft matting, and the Inland Petroleum Distribution System were also delivered in support of the operation.

In August 2002, U.S. Army Forces Command and the Joint Munitions Command formed a Centralized Ammunition Management integrated process team. The team's mission is to develop anticipatory logistical plans that allow the Joint Munitions Command to 'push' required ammunition support to installation ammunition supply points and eliminate the need for major Army commands to 'pull' support. These practices will include both training ammunition and wartime stocks. The team will use Fort Lewis, Washington, with a focus on Stryker brigade support requirements, and Fort Riley, Kansas, as an example of a site with Legacy Force systems

and relatively stable training requirements. The team's charter is expected to be finalized in early FY 2003.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

In November  2001,  the Crusader self-propelled howitzer-the replacement for the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer-completed its  system-level preliminary design review, closing out transition of the design  from  the  original  60-ton  version  to  a  more  deployable  40-ton version. This was a major step on the way to the expected Milestone B review in 2003. However, in May 2002, the Secretary of Defense canceled the Crusader program. The Secretary concluded that the Crusader did not fit his vision of future land forces that involved using lighter weight, rapidly  deployable  forces  in  combined  arms  operations  in  conjunction with air- and indirect-artillery-delivered precision munitions. Instead, he saw the excalibur family of 155-mm. precision-guided artillery rounds and  an  upgraded  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System  as  offering  greater improvements  in  precision,  range,  and  deployability .  In  July  2002,  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics allotted $32 million from the Crusader program to the Future Combat Systems  program.  In  March  2002,  the  first  Multiple  Launch  Rocket System  unit  to  receive  the  M270A1  launcher  completed  the  fielding

process. The M270A1 is an upgraded version of the M270 launcher. It is expected that a total of 225 launchers will be upgraded to the new version by the end of FY 2005.

The RAH-66 Comanche is a next-generation armed reconnaissance helicopter and is the first helicopter designed and developed specifically for this mission. Under development since 1983, the Comanche would replace the  Army's  current  fleet  of  AH-1  Cobra  and  OH-58  Kiowa  Warrior helicopters, performing the attack mission as well as reconnaissance. In September 2001, the Comanche project manager informed the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army that Milestone II cost and schedule commitments for the program could not be accomplished. In  December  2001,  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Army  approved  interim direction  to  discontinue  the  Milestone  II  program  and  to  revise  the engineering, manufacturing, and development phase work for 2002 and beyond. In April 2002, the contracting officer for Comanche issued a letter of instruction to the program's contractor team requesting that a proposal for the restructured program be submitted by 16 September 2002. It is expected that the restructuring plan will be approved in early FY 2003 by the Defense Acquisition Board and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.

In late October 2001, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command completed work on the Mission Needs Statement and the Statement of

Required Capabilities for the Future Combat Systems . These documents, along with the Units of Action and Units of employment Operations and Organization concept papers, form the foundation upon which future development of the Objective Force capability is based. On 2 November 2001, a draft solicitation for the Future Combat Systems was posted on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Web page to facilitate review by industry . The final solicitation was issued on 21 November 2001.

In  March  2002,  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency awarded an Other Transaction agreement to the Boeing/Science Applications International Corporation team to serve as lead systems integrator on Future Combat  Systems.  Other  Transaction  agreements  are  not  subject  to  the Federal Acquisition Regulation, allowing the Army considerable flexibility in negotiating terms and conditions with Boeing. The Army believed that using an Other Transaction agreement would encourage innovation and that the agreement's  wide  latitude  would  permit  tailoring  business,  organizational, and technical relationships to achieve the program goals.

Senior Army leaders decided to use a lead systems integrator because they  concluded  that  the  service's  existing  acquisition  workforce  and organizations had neither the technical capability-particularly in regard to computer software and network design-nor the organizational agility to manage the most complex program in the service's history. Many of the  Army's  previous  major  integration  efforts  suffered  from  a  lack  of coordination  between  the  developers  and  the  users.  each  system  was developed  separately  and  integrated  into  the  force  after  the  fact.  The Army believed that a lead systems integrator could develop and manage the  FCS-an  integrated  system  of  systems-more  effectively  than  an Army program office because contractors have greater flexibility to work across organizational lines. The lead systems integrator is the single entity responsible for developing and integrating the Future Combat Systems within the Army's budget and schedule. Furthermore, the lead systems integrator is responsible  for maximizing  competition  among  other contractors  involved  in  the  program,  ensuring  interoperability  among the systems, and maintaining commonality among systems to reduce lifecycle cost. The Army itself does not have a direct contractual relationship with the prime-item developers as it would when buying a single system, but rather works through the lead systems integrator.

In  March 2002, the U.S. Army Research Office announced that it had selected the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a UniversityAffiliated Research Center for the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies. The  institute  will  provide  the  Army  with  expertise  in  developing  and applying nanotechnology by funding unclassified basic research in this field. Furthermore, it will seek to apply breakthroughs made elsewhere in nanoscience and nanomanufacturing.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks and the subsequent heightened security measures had a substantial effect on total Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) funds. Net revenue for FY 2002 was $771.3 million, $23.1 million less than that for FY 2001. In October 2001, five MWR emergency essential civilian specialists deployed in support of Operation Enduring  FrEEdom :  two  to  Afghanistan,  one  to  Uzbekistan,  one  to Djibouti, and one to Qatar. In support of Operations noblE EaglE and Enduring FrEEdom , Army Community Service staff provided pre- and post-deployment briefings and training for soldiers and family readiness groups,  family  readiness  liaisons,  and  rear  detachment  commanders, conducting 4,700 sessions with 210,000 soldiers and family members.

## Army Continuing Education System

Initiated in July 2000, eArmyU is the world's largest distance learning portal,  providing  access  to  more  than  ninety  degree  and  certification programs from twenty-one universities.  During  FY  2002,  eArmyU  expanded to cover four posts in the continental United States, two in Alaska, three in Hawaii, one in germany, and one in Korea. eighty-four soldiers earned degrees through eArmyU, and nearly 20 percent of the participants said that they had reenlisted or extended specifically to take advantage of this opportunity.  Overall,  soldier  participation  in  traditional  post-secondary continuing education programs (excluding eArmyU) declined from 135,165 enrollees in FY 2001 to 127,179 enrollees in FY 2002.

## Housing

The ACSIM Facilities and Housing Directorate published the first Permanent Party enlisted Barracks Master Plan in May 2002. This served as the baseline for programming and planning barracks modernization for permanent party enlisted soldiers.

The Army's goal is to eliminate all inadequate family housing in the United States by FY 2007 using a combination of traditional military

construction, Basic Allowance for Housing increases, and privatization. In 1996, the Military Housing Privatization Initiative Act provided the military services with the authority to obtain private sector capital and expertise  to  operate,  manage,  maintain,  improve,  and  build  military housing in the United States. The Army's housing privatization program, the  Residential  Communities  Initiative  (RCI),  is  a  set  of  partnerships with private sector developers. During FY 2002, the Army transferred the houses at three posts to RCI partners: 5,912 homes at Fort Hood, Texas; 3,982 homes at Fort Lewis, Washington; and 3,170 homes at Fort Meade, Maryland. The Army has selected partners for eight additional projects: Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina;  the  Presidio  of  Monterey  and  the  Naval Postgraduate School, California; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Fort Hamilton, New Y ork; Fort Irwin, California; Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, georgia; and Forts eustis, Story, and Monroe, Virginia. Teams at these installations are collaborating with Residential Communities  Initiative partners to develop a 50-year community development and management plan. The transfer of operations at these installations is expected to occur during FY 2003 and FY 2004.

## Army Safety Program

The Army had 2,048 Class A to Class C accidents in FY 2002. ground accidents accounted for 1,912 of these, of which 189 were Class  A  (damages  of  $1  million  or  more;  destruction  of  military aircraft, injury resulting in a fatality or permanent total disability). Aviation accidents accounted for 136, of which 28 were Class A.  The Army lost 205 soldiers from accidents, an 11 percent increase from FY 2001 and a 16 percent increase above the previous three years' average. Aviation Class A accidents resulted in the loss of seventeen soldiers, a 55 percent increase from FY 2001 and 42 percent increase above the previous three years' average. ground accidents killed 188 soldiers, a 22 percent increase from FY 2001 and 19 percent increase over the previous three years' average. The leading cause of death was privately owned vehicle accidents, which killed 111 soldiers.

The Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army approved the Army Safety Strategic Plan in November 2001. This plan established safety and risk management objectives and required commanders of major Army commands and Headquarters, Department of the Army, functional proponents  to  develop  supporting  operational  plans  and  investment strategies for risk-based resource decisions across all funding accounts. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command developed and fielded the Commander's Safety Course in accordance with direction from the Chief of Staff of the Army to ensure commanders have the knowledge and tools

to  manage their unit safety programs effectively and to incorporate risk management into all unit planning and activities.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

During  FY  2002,  AAFeS  mobilized  to  support  an  ever-growing number  of  deployed  troops.  By  September  2002,  it  had  forty-eight approved contingency sites, thirty-four of which were in use, in seventeen countries  extending  from  the  Horn  of  Africa  to  the  former  Soviet Republics, with an additional thirteen new sites pending approval.  Total revenues  for  AAFeS  were  $7.295  billion,  3  percent  higher  than  the previous year. Key factors in the increase were a 3 percent increase in retail sales and a 6 percent increase in food sales. earnings almost totaled $329 million, about 4.67 percent of sales. Dividends to the Army and the Air Force were $220.4 million, just below the target of $221 million. In 2002, a number of economic factors combined to slow growth in the retail industry and AAFeS was not immune. AAFeS' financial revenue was affected by declining interest rates and the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies. The interest rate on the Military Star Card is linked to  the  prime  interest  rate,  charging  4.75  percent  above  prime.  As  the prime rate declined, so did the Military Star card rate. Interest revenue in  2002  was  $124.1  million,  down  13  percent  from  2001.  Unfavorable fluctuations  in  the  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  reduced  earnings because of overseas employment costs and other expenses. In addition to these economic factors, the additional costs of supporting Operation Enduring FrEEdom affected  AAFeS'  earnings;  the  cost  of  in-theater transportation, significant merchandise loss, provisions, and incentives for deployed personnel resulted in $6.2 million of unexpected expenditures.

In 2002, AAFeS completed forty major capital projects so customers can enjoy shopping at new, expanded, or updated facilities. While AAFeS is  approximately  98  percent  self-funded,  the  rest  of  its  funding  comes from appropriations. In FY 2002, AAFeS received approximately $155 million in appropriated funds. Of this amount, $25 million was used for utilities in overseas operations, defense telephone system access, facility maintenance, and the salaries of the approximately sixty active duty Army and Air Force military personnel assigned to AAFeS.

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

The Army Military Construction Program consists of the Military Construction Army, Army Family Housing, and Military Construction Army  Reserve  programs.  During  FY  2002,  these  activities  contained a total of 171 projects scheduled at $2.03 billion. As of 30 September

2002, the Corps of engineers successfully awarded 161 projects slated at $1.95 billion. Receipt of high bids for congressional inserts or emergency supplemental activities accounted for the majority of projects planned but not contracted during the fiscal year. All cost issues are being resolved, and all projects are scheduled for award during FY 2003.

The  FY  2002  Department  of  Defense  and  Support  for  Others construction program consisted of Foreign Military Sales, Department of Defense Medical Facilities, Department of Defense Schools, Arlington National  Cemetery,  Missile  Defense  Agency,  Navy,  Defense  Logistics Agency,  and  Defense  Manpower  Data  Center.  Interagency  support projects, known as Support for Others, are also included in the program totals. During FY 2002, Support for Others contained a total of seventysix  projects  totaling  $870  million.  Of  these,  sixty-eight  construction projects were forecast for contract awards totaling $850 million. As of 30 September 2002, the Corps of engineers awarded sixty-six projects totaling  $833  million.  Changes  in  priority  by  customers,  revisions,  resolicitation, and potential archeological conflicts precluded awarding the rest of the forecasted program during FY 2002. The Corps of engineers is working to resolve these problems and expects to award contracts for these projects during FY 2003.

The Army  made  significant progress toward implementing a Department of Defense plan to privatize utilities (electric, gas, water, and wastewater). The Army privatized 63 of the 351 systems at installations in the United States. In addition, eighty-nine utilities were exempted or deferred as having received no industry interest or receiving proposals that were determined to be uneconomical.

The FY 2002 National Defense Authorization Act provided authority for the Secretary of Defense to establish a memorial for the 11 September 2001  terrorist  attack  on  the  Pentagon  Reservation.  In  January  2002, following  an  October  2001  memorandum  of  agreement  between  the Defense Department's Washington Headquarters Services and the Corps of engineers, the two organizations signed a support agreement in which the Corps of engineers would provide the necessary planning, site selection, design,  and  related  technical  services  for  the  memorial.  In  April  2002, a site was chosen near the impact area on the west face of the Pentagon. The Corps of engineers is managing a two-stage competition to select a design. It is expected that finalists from among the 1,126 entries received will be chosen early in FY 2003. The finalists then will further develop their concepts, with selection of a winner expected later in FY 2003.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

During FY 2002, there was an average of 172 military personnel assigned  to  the  Corps  of  engineers  civil  works  program.  Civilian employees accounted for 24,965 full-time equivalent (FTe) work-years for this program in FY 2002, an increase of 295 FTe from the previous year. The Corps of engineers New Y ork District set up a disaster field office in Manhattan after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. From that office, the Corps assisted New Y ork City with emergency power, technical assistance, debris removal, and structural safety assessment. At the height of the deployment, 164 Corps personnel supported recovery efforts.  Twenty  structural  experts  and  four  surveyors  assisted  the  city in evaluating damage to buildings around the World Trade Center site. The Corps of engineers and the City of New Y ork worked together to remove 1.7 million tons of debris by barge from lower Manhattan to a landfill on Staten Island. In May 2002, this mission was completed, two months ahead of schedule. The Corps of engineers also provided technical assistance for debris removal at the Pentagon, and the Corps' structural experts evaluated the damage to the Pentagon building.

## Environmental Protection

Because of environmental Protection Agency reporting requirements, the Army tracks its hazardous waste generation on a calendar year rather than  a  fiscal  year  basis.  In  2001,  the  Army  disposed  of  35.6  million pounds  of  hazardous  waste-almost  twenty  million  pounds  less  than what it disposed of in 2000. This decrease is primarily a result of the Army demilitarizing fewer munitions in 2001 and, subsequently, generating less hazardous waste. In FY 2002, the Army generated over 1.6 million tons of solid waste, of which it recycled about 0.7 million tons and disposed of  0.9  million  tons,  a  43  percent  diversion  rate  (the  amount  of  waste recycled divided by the total amount generated). This rate surpassed the Department of Defense goal of diverting 40 percent of solid waste by 2005. The majority of this diversion is a result of recycling construction and demolition debris. In FY 2002, the Army procured 4,777 light-duty,

nontactical  vehicles,  which  fell  under  the  requirements  of  the  energy Policy Act of 1992 and executive Order 13149. Of these vehicles, 2,843 use alternative fuel, a procurement rate of 60 percent for these vehicles. Although this is less than the 75 percent procurement rate mandated by executive Order 13149, the Army has steadily increased its rate since FY 1997 and fully expects to meet this goal within the next few years. The Army acquires all of its alternative-fueled vehicles through leases with the general Services Administration.

In  FY  2002,  the  Army  obligated  $387  million  for  environmental restoration  activities  at  active  Army  installations.  This  included  $9.9 million  for  the  Military  Munitions  Response  Program.    In  FY  2002, the Army budgeted $143 million for restoration activities at installations slated  for  closure  by  the  Base  Realignment  and  Closures  (BRAC) program. The Army achieved remedy-in-place or response complete at 123 active installation sites, and 109 BRAC environmental cleanup sites.

Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

In FY 2001, the Department of Defense initiated the Small Business Reinvention Program. As part of this program, each military service was

required to establish small business improvement plans and performance targets for FY 2002 based on FY 2000 accomplishments. The success of the services' small business program is measured against these assigned targets.  In  FY  2002,  the  Army  implemented  a  number  of  initiatives pursuant to the Small Business Reinvention Program that resulted in an all-time high of dollars awarded for each area. The Army awarded over $10 billion in contracts to small businesses, making the service the first federal agency to reach that mark. Also, in FY 2002 the Army again awarded over $1 billion in contracts to women-owned small businesses.

## Legal Affairs

Significant increases in the number of cases tried in FY 2002 were fueled in part by a rise in so-called 'club drug' offenses, absent without leave  and  desertion  violations,  and  Internet  and  child  pornography crimes ( Table 5 ). Increased numbers of soldiers on active duty as the result of activation of Army National guard and Army Reserve units also contributed to the number of cases. The number of nonjudicial punishments  imposed  under  Article  15  of  the  Uniform  Code  of Military Justice was 44,318, a rate per thousand of 85.8. The number of Article 15 punishments declined 8.5 percent from FY 2001.

Source : 'Report of The Judge Advocate general of the Army, October 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002,' in Annual Report Submitted to the Committees on Armed Services of the United States Senate and the United States House of Represenatives and to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Transportation, and Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

There were 552 civil lawsuits filed in federal, state, and international courts against the Department of the Army and its officials, a 17 percent increase from FY 2001. Cases requiring civilian courts to interpret the Uniform Code of Military Justice remain a small, but significant, portion of this total. Most of these cases involve soldiers and former soldiers

seeking  collateral  review  of  courts-martial  proceedings-usually  via petitions for writs of habeas corpus filed in federal district courts-or in back-pay actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims. Other suits involved  challenges  to  confinement  conditions,  to  decisions  to  deny clemency  or  parole,  to  parole  revocation,  or  to  other  administrative actions taken by confinement facility officials.

Family violence statistics in the Army continued to decline, with 2,370 substantiated cases of child abuse in FY 2002 compared to 2,917 in FY 1998. The Army rate of substantiated child abuse decreased from 7.1 per 1,000 to 5.6 per 1,000 (based on initial substantiated cases)much less than the 14 per 1,000 in the civilian community reported by the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse. There were 3,235 substantiated spousal abuse cases in FY 2002 compared to 5,108 in FY 1998. Comparing the populations of married persons (soldiers and spouses) for FY 1998 (571,769) and FY 2002 (524,638), the rate of substantiated spousal abuse declined from 9.9 per 1,000 in FY 1998 to 6.7 per 1,000 in FY 2002.

## Inspector General Activities

During  FY  2002,  the  Assistance  Division  handled  2,210  Inspector general  Action  Requests  (IgARs).  The  requests  dealt  with  issues  or allegations regarding nonsenior officials, that is colonels and below, and gS-15 and below. This was a 9 percent increase from the previous year's total. Of the 2,210 requests, 2,033 were requests for assistance and 177 were allegations of impropriety . Of the 177 allegations, 59 were substantiated, while  118  were  unsubstantiated.  Of  the  2,210  IgARs,  the  active  Army accounted for 37 percent of the complainants. The Army Reserve and Army National guard accounted for 29 percent of complainants, 26 percent from civilians, and in 8 percent of cases the complainants' status was unknown.

The Inspector general Action Requests came from a variety of sources, including 12 presidential and 211 congressional inquiries. While the number of  presidential  inquiries  dropped  from  the  20  received  in  FY  2001,  the number of congressional inquiries increased from the 188 received in FY 2001. This increase is part of a continuing trend of congressmen requesting Inspector general support when seeking assistance for their constituents. The  Department  of  Defense  Hotline  accounted  for  458  requests.  This was a 20 percent increase in these types of cases. Whistleblower Reprisal requests accounted for 115 Inspector general Action Requests, which is approximately the same as in FY 2001. An additional sixteen cases dealt with allegations of improper mental health referrals.

Personnel  management  of  soldiers  was  the  most  frequent  type  of complaint (25 percent of cases). This includes promotions, reassignments,

evaluation  reports,  separations,  awards,  and  reenlistments.  The  next most  frequent  type  of  complaint  was  personal  conduct  (20  percent). This category includes sexual harassment, discrimination, standards of conduct,  and  nonsupport  of  family .  Nonsupport  of  family  accounted for 10 percent of all requests. The third most common type of complaint involved finance and accounting (18 percent). This includes travel pay, base pay inquiries, Army Reserve and Army National guard pay, bonuses, and reimbursements. Ten percent of complaints concerned the command or  management  of  organizations,  including  commander's  decisions, command climate issues, caring for soldiers and family members, and open door policies. Six percent of complaints were about health care, including medical evaluation boards, TRICARe availability, civilian medical bill payment, line of duty investigations, and medical records.

The Investigations Division probes allegations of misconduct made against general officers, senior executive service civilians, and promotable colonels. During  FY  2002,  the  division  received 877  allegations involving  411  senior  officials.  Of  these,  the  division  completed  321 informal inquiries and 30 investigations. Other accusations were referred to  the  Department  of  Defense  Inspector  general  or  the  Criminal Investigation Command or were addressed within the equal employment opportunity process. eight percent of the assertions that were initially provided to the Investigations Division were eventually substantiated. The most frequently substantiated issues involved travel or temporary duty irregularities, failure to obey a regulation, misuse of government personnel or equipment, and nonsexual personal misconduct.

The  FY  2002  chemical  surety  inspection  program  found  that nine out of fifteen surety units and sites received at least one failing deficiency in at least one functional area during the initial inspection. The FY 2002 nuclear surety inspection found that  one  out  of  four surety units or sites received at least one failing deficiency in at least one functional area during the initial inspection.

In November 2001, following attacks using anthrax sent by mail, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army directed the Inspector general to conduct a special inspection of Army facilities that store anthrax with an emphasis on accountability and security. Findings were presented to  the  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  on  30  November  2001.  Based  on  the information provided, the Vice Chief of Staff directed that an Army Biological Surety Program be established.

The Inspector general conducted several special inspections and  assessments.  A  special  inspection  of  environmental  compliance started in 2001 was completed in January 2002. It found that leaders at Army installations were not actively involved in environmental issues, resulting in a lack of formal strategy development. efforts to implement

pollution prevention programs lacked command emphasis, awareness, and funding. There were no documented requirements for the minimum staffing or standard of services provided by installation environmental offices. An assessment initiated in 2001 sought to determine if the Army had doctrinally and culturally integrated the risk management process into training and operations at both the institutional and unit level. By the end of FY 2002 the report of this inspection was written, and the assessment team was briefing the appropriate Army Staff agencies on the findings and recommendations. Distribution of the final report will follow soon after the findings are briefed to the Chief of Staff of the Army.

A  special  inspection  examined  implementation  of  training  on  the Army's homosexual conduct policy. The inspection found that 71 percent of the soldiers polled received homosexual conduct policy training within the last year, 87 percent of the soldiers polled understood homosexual conduct policy either moderately or to a great extent, and 70 percent of the soldiers polled did not know at least one of the individuals who could guarantee them confidentiality if they wanted to report harassment.

An evaluation of the Army's organizational inspection program started  in  FY  2001  was  completed  in  FY  2002.  This  assessment examines  whether  major  commands  and  state  adjutants  general coordinate all inspections and audits into a single, cohesive program that complements and reinforces other sources of evaluation; identifies and eliminates  deficiencies  that  degrade  unit  readiness;  and  relieves the burden of redundant inspections. The report and briefings for this assessment were not completed by the end of FY 2002.

## Army Audit Agency

As  a  result  of  a  change  in  the  Comptroller  general  standards  on independence,  the  Army  Audit  Agency  was  no  longer  considered  an independent  external  auditor  and  therefore  could  no  longer  audit  and provide an opinion on the Army's financial statements. In FY 2002, the agency provided support to the Army's financial statements by continuing audits  addressing  controls  over  financial  data  and  information  systems' compliance with federal financial requirements and through participation in  the  Army's  strategic  planning  group  on  financial  statements.  These efforts  are  designed  to  lower  the  overall  risk  associated  with  financial data  by  identifying  control  weaknesses  and  providing  recommendations for corrective action. This will facilitate the financial statement audits by external auditors. The agency did complete financial statement audits for the American Red Cross, the National Science Center, and the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff Welfare and Recreation Association Fund. The Army

Audit Agency is external to these organizations and thus could provide financial statement audit services to them.

Because of its reduced workload in the financial statement area, the Army Audit Agency was able to expand its efforts in operational aspects of the Army's financial activities. Topics the agency examined included  the  aviation  hydraulic  system  contamination  program, controls  over  operating  tempo  funds,  computer-based  training  for information  technology,  information  assurance  in  the  Army,  the management  of  Tables  of  Distribution  and  Allowances  and  fulltime  support  maintenance  activities,  the  processes  and  procedures used to prioritize and develop courseware for the Distance Learning Program, and the Army's missile demilitarization strategy.

## The Army and Arms Control

Fiscal year 2002 was a volatile year for the Chemical Demilitarization Program. Many  significant accomplishments and milestones were achieved and a few setbacks were encountered. Public Law 99-145 (as amended) mandates disposal of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile by 29 April 2007, consistent with the requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The U.S. Army is the executive agent for this mission. The chemical stockpile is stored at eight locations within the continental United  States.  Disposal  of  the  chemical  stockpile  at  a  ninth  location, Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, was completed in November 2000.

As of 30 September 2002, a total of 25.6 percent (measured in tons of  chemical  agent)  of  the  original  U.S.  chemical  stockpile  had  been safely destroyed at the two operational sites, Johnston Atoll and Tooele, Utah.  On  25  December  2001,  the  last  of  888  nerve  agent  gB-filled MK116 Weteye  bombs  was  destroyed  from  the  stockpile  at  Deseret Chemical Depot. The MK116 Weteye bomb is the first munition type to be completely eliminated from the U.S. inventory of chemical munitions. The  United  States  reached  a  major  Chemical  Weapons  Convention milestone that required the extermination of 100 percent of Category 3  chemical  material  by  29  April  2002.  The  last  Category  3  chemical weapons were destroyed on 5 March 2002. The Tooele, Utah, chemical agent  disposal  facility  continued  disposal  of  the  chemical  stockpile stored at Deseret Chemical Depot. As of 30 September 2002, a total of 44.4 percent (measured in tons of chemical agent) of the chemical stockpile stored there had been safely destroyed.  Construction of the Anniston, Alabama, and the Umatilla, Oregon, chemical agent disposal facilities was completed during the fiscal year.  Construction at the Pine Bluff, Arkansas, chemical agent disposal facility continued and, as of 30 September 2002, was approximately 97 percent complete.

## Recovery from the 11 September 2001 Attack on the Pentagon

The  terrorist  attack  on  the  Pentagon  killed  125  people  in  the building,  75  of  whom  were  soldiers,  Army  civilian  employees,  and contractors  working  for  the  Army.  The  attack  destroyed  or  badly damaged  the  work  spaces  of  several  Army  Staff  and  Secretariat offices, most notably those of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, g-1. Following the attack, temporary work spaces elsewhere in the Pentagon, in other buildings used by the Army, and in rented offices in the Washington, D.C., area were used to reestablish a functioning Army Staff and Secretariat. Through the end of FY 2001 and into early FY 2002, surviving personnel from the affected elements integrated replacements, rebuilt their files and other necessary documents, and reestablished digital office systems.

Reconstruction  of  the  Pentagon  began  in  October  2001.    The reconstruction work, along with the reorganization of the Army Staff and Secretariat  mandated  by  the  Realignment  Task  Force,  forced  a number of offices to relocate several times during the remainder of FY 2002. By February 2002, the Army Staff element most affected by the attack, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, g-1, had returned all  its  elements  to  the  Pentagon,  albeit  to  still  temporary  quarters as reconstruction work continued on the area of the building it had occupied on the day of the attack. The g-1's return to its original location in the Pentagon began in August 2002 and is expected to be completed early in FY 2003.

## 9 Conclusion

Fiscal year 2002 was a demanding year for the Army as it once again went to war. Although now at its smallest size since World War II,  the  service  participated  in  numerous  operational  deployments  at home and overseas, most notably in Afghanistan. These operations required the largest mobilization of reserve personnel since the Persian gulf War of 1990-1991. At the same time, the Army continued the process of transforming into a service prepared for the post-Cold War era. The most important aspect of that transformation was evolving from  an  industrial-age,  threat-based  force  to  an  information-age, capabilities-based, power-projection force. This transition affected both the operational elements of the service and the institutional Army. For the institutional Army, FY 2002 was a year of great change with the implementation of the Realignment Task Force's recommendations.

During FY 2002, the service continued its efforts to compensate for the post-Cold War reduced strength of its operational forces by exploiting new information-age technologies and more lethal and precise weapons systems. The Army's goal of fighting smarter and as a greater part of a joint team underscored many of its initiatives, including the Objective Force concept and the associated Future Combat Systems, both of which reached  significant  milestones  during  the  year.  To  make  more  money available for this transformation, the Army funded only the most critical modernization programs in the Legacy Force as part of its recapitalization concept. At the same time, it sought to bridge the gap between the present and the future with the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams.

By the end of FY 2002, the Army had made further advances in its evolution into a post-Cold War force, despite the setbacks of the Crusader cancellation and the Comanche restructuring. Still, the competing visions of Army transformation held by the Secretary of Defense and the service's senior leaders-most visibly expressed in the Crusader cancellation and in analyses of the initial phase of operations in Afghanistan-meant that the final shape of the Army transformation was still in flux.

Army leaders during FY 2002 once again had to consider carefully how  to  allocate  available  funds  among  quality  of  life,  modernization programs,  and  readiness.  The  service's  size  relative  to  its  increased commitments during the year meant that soldiers deployed with increasing frequency and that their deployments lasted longer. In this operational

climate, quality-of-life issues grew in importance, and the Army devoted significant attention and resources to these matters because they play an important  role  in  recruiting  new  soldiers,  retaining  trained  personnel, sustaining morale, and supporting readiness.

Finally, at the end of FY 2002 the Army faced growing uncertainty about current and future deployments. Despite the successful overthrow of the Taliban, Afghanistan remained unsettled and Army forces could not be withdrawn. Other commitments within Operation Enduring FrEEdom also continued, most notably in the Philippines and the new detention facility at guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At home, the  service  supported  Operation noblE  EaglE .  These  open-ended missions placed considerable stress on the Army, forcing it to invoke stop-loss  provisions  and  rely  heavily  on  the  reserve  components. Looming on the horizon at the end of the fiscal year was the increasing likelihood of a major land war in Iraq.
