## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2020

## 1 Introduction

For the Army, as with the rest of the world, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was the most important aspect of fiscal year (FY) 2020. Before the pandemic became widespread in the United States, the Army faced the by-now common state of beginning the fiscal year without an approved budget. The demand from combatant commands for Army forces remained high and American soldiers continued to be killed and wounded in action. The service's highest priority remained modernization-in materiel, doctrine, talent management, and organization-to prepare for large-scale combat operations.

The pandemic forced the  Army  to  alter  how  it  operated  across almost  all  its  functions.  At  the  same  time,  the  need  for  a  national response  to  the  pandemic  created  a  high  demand  for  soldiers  from all three components. The Army National Guard (ARNG) especially assisted civil authorities in their responses to the pandemic. During the second half of FY 2020, the Army also supported civil authorities in responding to widespread public unrest and several natural disasters.

## The Army and the COVID-19 Pandemic

This chapter provides a brief overview of the Army and the pandemic. Other chapters contain more detail on how the pandemic affected the Army and what the Army did to support civil authorities.

In  early  December  2019,  cases  of  a  pneumonia-like  respiratory illness  of  unknown  cause  developed  in  the  city  of  Wuhan,  Hubei Province, China. Initial analysis by Chinese scientists indicated that the cause of the illness was a novel, or new, coronavirus-a large family of viruses that cause a variety of illnesses with effects ranging from minor to deadly. Scientists named the illness caused by this particular viral strain the novel coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19.

After the first reported case of COVID-19 in the United States on 21 January 2020, Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), activated  a  crisis  action  team  (CAT)  in  the  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief  of  Staff,  G-3/5/7.  This  team's  mission  was  to  monitor  the spread of the virus and assist Army senior leaders in implementing the  service's  response.  The  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-3/5/7,  acted  as HQDA's operational headquarters for the pandemic. It established an operational planning team (OPT) and an Army COVID Campaign Plan  (AC2P)  team.  The  OPT  functioned  as  a  bridge  between  the CAT's short-term crisis management focus and the AC2P's long-term planning  focus.  All  three  teams  had  rotating  members  from  other Army Staff offices and from the Army Secretariat to ensure effective coordination of HQDA's efforts.

At the end of January, President Donald J. Trump established a COVID-19 interagency task force to monitor the virus's impact and the Department of Health and Human Services announced a public health emergency. Because of the rapid increase in cases in the United States,  the  president  declared  a  National  Emergency in mid-March. This declaration authorized the Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain provisions of applicable laws and regulations to more effectively deal with the pandemic.

The first Army experiences with COVID-19 occurred in Korea and helped to inform the service-wide response to the virus. As the virus spread quickly throughout the region early in 2020, U.S. Forces, Korea (USFK), implemented several measures designed to control the spread of the disease among its personnel, families, and contractors. On 24 February, USFK confirmed its first case of COVID-19: a 61-year-old,

widowed, retiree dependent. To ensure military installations remained safe,  USFK  limited  the  number  of  people  who  could  access  the installations. It adjusted work schedules and restricted the workforce to mission-essential personnel only. USFK also curtailed social and off-duty activities. Additionally, it conducted rapid investigations for COVID-19  positive  cases  involving  USFK-affiliated  personnel.  On 26 February, the command confirmed a second positive COVID-19 case,  which also was the first confirmed case of an infected soldier. On  8  March,  HQDA  issued  a  stop  movement  order  and  delay  of travel  order  for  all  Army  soldiers  and  family  making  a  permanent change of station move to or from South Korea. On 12 March, the Department of Defense (DoD) imposed travel restrictions across the entire department.

Protecting  the  force  to  maintain  operational  capability  became HQDA's  priority  early  in  the  pandemic.  On  20  February,  it  issued Execute Order 144-20. The order stated that all Army Components, Army Service Component Commands, and Direct Reporting Units would  immediately  plan  and  prepare  to  protect  soldiers  and  their families, civilian employees, and contractors. It also directed the Army to  enhance  its  capability  to  support  civil  authorities  in  the  United States while maintaining the readiness to deploy units as required by the  overseas  combatant  commands.  This  order  and  its  subsequent annexes  became  the  framework  for  HQDA's  response  over  the  first three months of the pandemic.

On 18 March, the commander of U.S. Northern Command designated the commanding general of U.S. Army, North (ARNORTH), as  the  commander of the Joint Force Land Component Command (JFLCC) for requests for military support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Operations in previous emergencies, such as hurricanes, had entailed coordination across just a state or a region. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, required ARNORTH for the first time to provide support across the entire continental United States.  On 24 March, JFLCC established four headquarters for this mission: Task Force-Northeast, Task Force-Southeast, Task ForceCenter, and Task Force-West.

The JFLCC reached its peak strength of 8,874 personnel on 16 April. It drew the majority of its personnel from two Army Reserve units,  the  807th  Medical  Command  (Deployment Support) and the 377th  Sustainment  Command.  On  26  April,  ARNORTH  began  to reduce  its  COVID-19  operations.  During  the  midsummer  increase in  COVID-19  cases,  ARNORTH  again  supported  civil  authorities with active and reserve component units. It also developed two new

organizations to provide flexible medical support in rural areas, where much of the summer's outbreak occurred.

By 24 March, the Army had 288 confirmed cases of COVID-19: 100 soldiers,  64  civilian  employees,  65  dependents,  9  cadets,  and  50 contractors. In response, HQDA implemented additional restrictions and preventive measures, and the Army raised the Health Protection Condition (HPCON) level on 24 March to Charlie at all installations. Measures  implemented  at  this  level  included  less  than  25  percent normal occupancy of work spaces, social distancing, and closure of most common areas such as schools. The chief of staff, Army, placed contingency response forces-forces that are ready to deploy worldwide within eighteen hours-under HPCON Delta status, the highest and most protective level in which individuals are effectively quarantined to prevent infection. Also by 24 March, more than 8,000 ARNG soldiers were supporting states, three territories, and the District of Columbia in their response to the pandemic.

In late March, the secretary of the Army directed Army medical units  to  augment  American  healthcare  services.  The  president  then authorized the activation of reserve component units and individual service  members  in  selected  reserves  and  certain  members  of  the Individual Ready Reserve in response to the pandemic. By 13 April, a member of the New Jersey ARNG had become the first soldier to die from the virus.

FEMA gave the Corps of Engineers a mission to assess buildings for use as alternate care sites and to oversee the conversion of selected buildings. An alternate care site is a building temporarily converted for healthcare use during a public health emergency to reduce the burden on hospitals and established medical facilities. Local leaders identified available buildings, such  as hotels, dormitories,  and  convention centers, in a prioritized order. Once identified, a team from the Corps of Engineers would assess the structure's suitability. The state, local, tribal, or territorial authority leased the selected buildings as alternate care sites. The Corps of Engineers and its contractors then designed and  constructed  the  necessary  modifications.  Once  completed,  the requesting  authority  became  responsible  for  operating  the  site.  By the end of April, the Corps of Engineers had assessed 1,129 sites for possible use as alternate care facilities and had awarded 32 construction contracts to add 14,544 beds to states with critical bed shortages.

To provide medical professionals for communities heavily affected by  the  virus,  the  Army  developed  a  new  organizational  concept, creating eighty-five-person Urban Augmentation Medical Task Forces (UAMTFs). Each UAMTF included personnel with a range of medical specialties, from doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists to supply

and  administrative  staff,  capable  of  supporting  up  to  250  patients. Initially,  the  Army  deployed  UAMTFs  to  staff  alternate  care  sites. By early April, it had become apparent that this was not an efficient use of these task forces. Some of the largest alternate care sites had few or no patients. On 5 April, FEMA approved plans for integrating UAMTF teams directly into local hospitals that had large numbers of COVID-19 patients.

On 19 May, the secretary of defense issued updated guidance that allowed commanders to make risk-based changes to HPCON levels based on local conditions. Commanders were to work in collaboration with local authorities and military medical officials before making any changes. The secretary also issued updated guidance that would allow commanders to lift travel restrictions based on local risk conditions.

On 26 May, HQDA issued an order outlining the Army's transition from  immediate  response  to  sustained  operations  in  a  COVID-19 world, acknowledging that the virus would have an enduring impact on  the  service's  operations.  The  order  provided  guidance  on  how the  Army  would  ease  restrictions  on  an  installation-by-installation basis,  informed  by  a  conditions-based  transition  framework  and local  governance.  This  guidance  gave  leaders  throughout  the  force the authority and flexibility to adjust restrictions based on the risks posed  by  the  virus  at  their  locations.  Finally,  the  order  directed senior commanders to resume readiness, training, and modernization activities while ensuring a safe environment for all personnel.

A  key  component  of  the  Army's  transition  framework  was  the collection and assessment of key data at the installation level. These included the local case rate and the capacity to treat, test, and monitor COVID-19. Installation commanders also needed to account for local governance considerations and ensure mitigation measures remained in place at the garrison level. By 5 June, the commanding generals of Fort Drum, New York, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky, had lowered their HPCON levels from Charlie to Bravo. By the end of June, sixteen other major Army installations in the United States had done the same.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

General  Order  2020-01,  published  in  March  2020,  made  several changes  in  the  assignment  of  functions  and  responsibilities  within HQDA.  The  assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (installations,  energy and environment) is now responsible for installation modernization. Installation modernization has several components. It revises installation infrastructure and services in response to the changing social and economic expectations of soldiers and their families. It incorporates emergent technologies to maximize soldier and family health, welfare, and readiness. It adapts installations to support new training doctrine, modernized equipment, and new protection requirements.

The  Surgeon  General  is  now  the  HQDA  office  responsible  for assessing the policies and programs of Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The chief, National Guard Bureau, replaced the director, ARNG, as the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff, Army, on matters relating to the ARNG. The director, ARNG, remains  a  principal  HQDA  official  and  assists  the  chief,  National Guard Bureau, in carrying out the functions of the National Guard Bureau as they relate to the ARNG.

In May 2019, the secretary of the Army directed the under secretary of the Army to review how effectively HQDA managed the Army's cybersecurity, information technology, information management, and data analytics capabilities. He initiated the review in light of the 2018 National  Defense  Strategy,  which  stressed  how  digital  information created  by  computer-based  technologies  had  changed  the  nature  of great power competition since the end of the Cold War. The secretary's guidance for the review, in line with that given for the Army Reform Initiative, was that the Army Secretariat was responsible for developing policies and programs and overseeing their implementation, whereas the Army  Staff  was  responsible for planning, resourcing, and supervising the execution of those policies and programs.

An information management implementation group, cochaired by the director of the Office of Business Transformation and the chief information officer/deputy chief of staff, G-6, (CIO/G-6) developed six courses of action. One of these was to split the current CIO/G-6 position in the Army Secretariat into a chief information officer in the Army Secretariat and a deputy chief of staff, G-6, on the Army Staff. The CIO would be the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army regarding information technology. The CIO would be responsible for exercising overall supervision for information technology policy and governance;  information  resource  management;  and  cyber  security policy. The G-6 would be the principal military adviser to the chief information officer and the chief of staff, Army, regarding information technology.  The  G-6  would  be  responsible  for  planning;  strategy; network  architecture;  and  implementation  of  command,  control, communications, cyber operations, and networks.

In March 2020, the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff, Army,  approved  this  course  of  action.  The  change  occurred  in  two phases. The first phase concerned preparations for the transition and concluded in May 2020. The second phase saw the reorganization of the CIO/G-6 office into the two new offices and concluded in August 2020.

In  November  2019,  the  Army  established  an  Enterprise  Cloud Management  Office  in  HQDA's  Office  of  the  Chief  Information Officer/G-6. The new office's primary functions are to establish the Army's  cloud  environment  and  to  synchronize  and  integrate  cloud efforts across the Army. After the separation of the Office of the Chief Information  Officer/G-6  into  two  separate  offices,  the  Enterprise Cloud  Management  Office  is  now  part  of  the  Office  of  the  Chief Information Officer.

In FY 2020, HQDA's deputy chief of staff, G-3/5/7, transformed its cyber  directorate  into  a  strategic  operations  directorate.  This realignment  combined  several  elements  of  the  G-3/5/7  related  to integrating, prioritizing, and synchronizing multidomain, dataenabled  warfighting  systems.  The  new  organization  will  ensure  the Army  sources  and  executes  policies  and  programs  to  leverage  the service's information technology, cyberspace operations, information management, and data analytics. The strategic operations directorate consists of operations and requirements, enterprise systems, mission command, information operations, space, and cyber divisions.

In  April  2020,  HQDA's  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-4,  established a  provisional  medical  logistics  division.  The  COVID-19  pandemic exposed gaps in reporting and oversight of medical logistics created by the realignment of medical logistics, medical research and development, and  medical  procurement  from  Army  Medical  Command  to  Army

Materiel  Command  and  Army  Futures  Command  (AFC).  The G-4's  medical  logistics  division  has  three  responsibilities:  establish and  maintain  a  Class  VIII  personal  protective  equipment  common operating  picture  for  the  Army;  unify  the  planning,  programming, budgeting, and execution process for medical logistics in the Army; and  determine  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  a  G-4  permanent medical logistics division.

In October 2019, the service discontinued Army  Financial Management Command as a  direct  reporting  unit  to  the  assistant  secretary of the Army (financial management and comptroller) and reassigned it as a major subordinate command of Army Materiel Command. This change brings all finance capabilities into the sustainment warfighting function.  Army  Financial  Management  Command  will  continue  to provide direct support to the office of the assistant secretary of the Army (financial  management  and  comptroller)  in  executing  its  statutory responsibilities and has direct liaison authority with that office. The command also will continue to provide functional oversight of finance and comptroller tactical formations to ensure technical readiness.

## Management

Army  Directive  2019-35,  published  in  November  2019,  defined responsibilities for programming, managing, and executing research, development,  and  test  and  evaluation  budget  activities  regarding the future force modernization enterprise. The assistant secretary of the  Army  (acquisition,  logistics  and  technology)  (ASA  (ALT))  and the  commanding general, AFC, serve as cochairs of the Equipping Program Evaluation Group (EE PEG) and jointly recommend to the secretary  of  the  Army  the  EE  PEG  portion  of  the  service's  budget submission. In the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process,  the  EE  PEG  is  responsible  for  approving  the  prioritization of  all  programs  and  supporting  resource-informed  decision-making during  the  planning,  programming,  and  budgeting  phases  of  the process. For all science and technology efforts, the ASA (ALT) and the AFC commanding general jointly will conduct project reviews before submission  of  the  program  objective  memorandum  and  perform periodic execution reviews at the request of either official. The AFC commanding general is responsible for three budget activities: basic research, advanced research, and advanced technology development. The  ASA  (ALT)  is  responsible  for  four  budget  activities:  advanced component  development  and  prototypes;  system  development  and

demonstration; research, development, testing, and evaluation management support; and operational system development.

During FY 2020, HQDA's deputy chief of staff, G-9, continued its transition of military construction facility investment planning. The transition  moves  this  planning  from  a  headquarters-centric  process to one in which the Regular Army (RA), the ARNG, and the Army Reserve  (USAR)  take  the  lead  in  military  construction  program development in accordance with priorities set by Army senior leaders. The  G-9  did  not  renew  the  charter  of  the  Military  Construction Integrated  Programming  Team,  effectively  disbanding  this  HQDA committee that had annually reviewed the service's five-year military construction program. As part of this transition, G-9 assisted Army Materiel Command as it assumed the responsibility for validating the RA's military construction program.

Since the Army began the continuous process improvement program in FY 2006, it has delivered an average annual financial benefit, in savings and cost avoidance, of $1 billion. In FY 2020, it produced a financial benefit of $2.251 billion. The program trains practitioners to improve the performance of Army business operations. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY 2020 the program produced only 45 new practitioners, down from 490 in FY 2019. The Business Process Reengineering Center of Excellence at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, conducts a three-tiered training program. Because of the pandemic,  the  center  restructured  both  the  Tier  One  Foundation and Tier Two Intermediate courses to accommodate online learning.  In  FY 2020, 170 students completed the Tier One course, 44 students completed the Tier Two course, and 1 student attained Tier Three certification.

In July 2020, the Army established a policy to implement the secretary of defense's directive on the public display or depiction of flags.

## Information Management

In April 2020, the office of the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management  and  comptroller),  in  partnership  with  Army  Materiel Command and HQDA's Office of Business Transformation, established an enterprise business systems multifunctional capabilities team. The Army's  enterprise  business  system  cannot  support  efficiently  the Army's efforts to modernize and raise readiness any longer. The team's objective is to develop a new enterprise business system that improves business process execution, increases the availability of data and its analytical  value,  and  takes  advantage  of  cloud  computing advances

to  reduce  costs.  The  team  is  cochaired  by  the  assistant  secretary  of the Army (financial management and comptroller) and Army Materiel Command's commanding general. The team includes representatives from the business-mission domains of finance, logistics, acquisition, and human resources. The team reached its initial operating capability in September 2020.

The  Army  Cloud  Plan,  published  in  FY  2020,  superseded  the Cloud Strategy issued in 2015. Publication of the plan is part of the Army's  data  and  cloud  migration  initiatives.  These  initiatives  will increase  the  speed  of  data-informed  decision-making  and  deliver cloud-enabled, next-generation capabilities in a fundamentally different  way.  The  plan  describes  the  Army's  vision  for  leveraging cloud  computing  to  maintain  information  superiority  and  produce digital  overmatch.  (Digital  overmatch  is  being  better  equipped  and more skillful than an adversary in the use of information technology.) It  has  six  objectives:  accelerate  data-driven  decisions;  decrease  time to field software; optimize the security accreditation process; establish cloud design, software development, and data engineering as a core competency;  design  software  to  adapt  to  an  unpredictable  world; and provide information technology asset and cost transparency. The Enterprise Cloud Management Office will oversee implementation of the Army Cloud Plan. Through a partnership between the Enterprise Cloud Management Office and the Army Analytics Group, the CIO stood up 'cArmy,' the service's foundation of common secure cloud services  that  aligns  with  the  Defense  Information  Systems  Agency's secure  cloud  computing  architecture.  During  FY  2020,  the  Army began moving data systems, services, and applications to cArmy.

The  General  Fund  Enterprise  Business  System  (GFEBS)  is  the Army's financial, asset, and accounting management system. In July 2020, the system completed its migration to the cloud, moving over thirty  terabytes  of  data  from  outdated  storage  centers  to  a  cloud environment  seven  months  ahead  of  schedule.  It  is  the  first  of  five Army  enterprise  resource-planning  systems  scheduled  for  transfer to  cloud  computing  by  2022.  These  transfers  will  mitigate  the  risk of losing critical  financial  data  from  problems  at  a  data  center  and increase the speed at which these systems can run.

During  FY  2020,  the  Program  Executive  Office  for  Enterprise Information  Systems  extended  GFEBS  to  the  Navy's  Bureau  of Medicine and Surgery. In late 2018, the Navy decided to transition its  medical  facilities  from  its  Standard  Accounting  and  Reporting System-Field Level to GFEBS. After a pilot effort in FY 2019, the program expanded to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in FY 2020 in multiple waves to more than 1,100 users at 36 separate facilities. In

addition  to  Navy  medical  facilities,  by  the  end  of  FY  2020,  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the National Capital Region Medical Directorate, the DHA, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences all were using GFEBS. The GFEBS conversions enable DHA financial and funding control of Army, Navy, and DHA sites that use the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support system.

## Audits

In FY 2020, the independent public accounting firm conducting the annual audits of the Army General Fund and the Working Capital Fund  financial  statements  made  more  than  7,000  requests  to  the Army,  conducted  222  site  visits,  and  tested  approximately  16,900 sample items. Both audits resulted in a disclaimer of opinion by the firm. It could not conclude whether the service presented the Army General  Fund  and  Working  Capital  Fund  financial  statements  and related notes fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Army did not provide sufficient or appropriate evidence to  support  the  information  in  the  financial  statements  because  of inadequate processes, control gaps, and insufficient records to support transactions and account balances. The audit revealed that there were twelve  General  Fund  and  thirteen  Working  Capital  Fund  material weaknesses  remaining  related  to  the  Army's  financial  reporting processes and internal control environment.

## Budget

The Army's FY 2020 base budget request continued the effort to achieve by 2028 a force that is organized, trained, and equipped for prompt, sustained ground combat as part of joint and multinational teams in a multidomain battlespace. It built upon the Army's progress in recovering  from  depleted  levels  of  readiness  brought  about  by  operations in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  The  secretary  of  the  Army's  five  priorities for  the  service  shaped  the  request:  building  readiness  for  high-intensity conflict against strategic competitors and maintaining the Army's readiness for low-intensity conflict; modernizing doctrine, equipment, and formations to conduct multidomain operations; strengthening alliances and partnerships; taking care of soldiers, civilian employees, and their families; and reforming practices and processes to ensure the best use of resources ( Table 1 ).

Comptroller), FY 2020 President's Budget Highlights , March 2019

In the FY  2020 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request,  military  personnel  accounts  primarily  funded  mobilized reserve component soldiers and active component deployment costs. The OCO operation and maintenance request supported Operation Freedom's  sentinel in  Afghanistan;  Operation inherent  resolve operations against the Islamic State; the European  Deterrence Initiative; Operation spartan shield supporting the regionally aligned forces concept in the Arabian Gulf region; and other counterterrorism operations.  The  research,  development,  and  acquisition  accounts funded replacement of battle losses, ammunition replenishment, and the enhancement of pre-positioned equipment stocks in Europe. The Afghanistan  Security  Forces  Fund  provides  assistance  to  Afghan security  forces.  The  Counter-ISIS  (Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria) Train  and  Equip  Fund  builds  key  security  force  capabilities,  helps professionalize security forces, and promotes long-term stability of the Middle East region ( Table 2 ).

At the end of FY 2019, Congress had not approved the Army's budget for FY 2020. Instead, the service operated from two back-toback continuing resolutions that provided funding allocations pegged to FY 2019-enacted levels. Operating under a continuing resolution places restrictions on  new  starts, ongoing  program  expansions, production  rate  increases,  and  the  reprogramming  of  funds.  The president signed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2020 on 20 December 2019.

Congress enacted a base budget for the Army $1.4 billion lower than the amount the service requested and an OCO budget for the Army  $692  million  lower  than  the  service  requested.  The  total enacted budget for FY 2020 had a decrease in the military personnel and  operation  and  maintenance  accounts,  but  an  increase  in  the procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation accounts ( Table 3 and Table 4 ).

Under  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security (CARES) Act, which became law in March 2020, the Army received an additional $1.14 billion in appropriated funds for FY 2020. The act funded the purchase of medical supplies and equipment; the purchase of  nonmedical  personal  protective  equipment;  enhancements  of information technology equipment and services to facilitate increased telework  operations;  delivery  of  distributed  learning  in  lieu  of  onsite training; the increased cost of conducting initial entry individual training with appropriate distancing measures; increased cleaning and sanitizing  contracts;  and  the  cost  of  isolation  measures,  to  include stocking Meals, Ready-to-Eat, to be served to soldiers in lieu of dining facility operations to maintain social distancing. The act relaxed some

contracting  restrictions  for  the  Corps  of  Engineers  and  provided $70 million in direct appropriations to the Army's civil works program for actions related to COVID-19 prevention and response. By the end of April 2020, the Army had committed $587 million in response to COVID-19. Of that, $199 million had come from the CARES Act. By the end of July, the total Army expenditure related to the pandemic had  topped  $2.2  billion,  with  83  percent  of  that  amount  from  the CARES Act.

Through  a  series  of  internal  DoD  reprogramming  actions,  the Army  received  and  obligated  $1.2  billion  by  the  end  of  the  fiscal year.  The  Army submitted thirty reprogramming packages, totaling $2.5  billion,  to  Congress.  Congress  approved  twenty-seven  of  these requests for a total of $2.4 billion.

The Army Working Capital Fund consists of two activity groups: supply management and industrial operations. The first group buys and manages spare and repair parts for sale to its customers, primarily Army operating units. The second group provides the Army an organic industrial capability. It uses a revolving fund concept, relying on revenue from sales to finance operations rather than direct appropriations from Congress. The Army does request some direct appropriations for the fund to maintain its capability to meet mobilization and wartime surge requirements. For FY 2020, however, the fund received appropriation and balance transfers of more than $839.8 million, a $575.4 million increase  from  FY  2019.  Revenue  losses  created  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic,  which  forced  modifications  to  scheduled  deployments, canceled training events, and reduced demand for depot operations, drove this increase.

The Army's FY 2021 budget request supports the service's priorities of people, readiness, modernization, and reform. It has an increase of $3.8 billion over the amount enacted in the FY 2020 base budget; the increase  is  mostly  in  the  military  personnel  and  the  operations  and maintenance accounts (See Table  5 ).  The  request  has  a  decrease  of $5.9 billion from the amount enacted in the FY 2020 OCO budget; the  decrease  is  mostly  in  the  procurement  and  the  operations  and maintenance accounts (See Table 6 ).

The amount requested will maintain a force of 485,900 in the RA, 336,500 in the ARNG, and 189,800 in the USAR, along with 197,593 civilian employees. It also will support the service's efforts to improve the  quality  of  life  for  its  people  by  funding  adequate  investments in family housing and  barracks; transformation of the DHA; improvement  of  child  and  youth  services;  enhancement  of  spouse employment opportunities; and minimization of negative effects from permanent change-of-station moves.

The intent of the FY 2021 operations and maintenance request is  that  all  units  in  each  of  the  three  components will have sufficient resources  to  reach  their  assigned  readiness  proficiency  level.  This request  continues  the  Army's  effort  to  achieve  its  tactical  readiness objective by FY 2022: two-thirds of brigade combat teams (BCTs) at the highest readiness levels. As part of that effort, the request provides for  home-station unit training focused on decisive-action capability, and twenty-four BCT-level combat training center rotations, with four of these rotations reserved for ARNG units. To improve soldier and unit readiness, the FY 2021 request expands enlisted initial entry training from fourteen to twenty-two weeks for soldiers in armor, cavalry scout, and combat engineer specialties. This change follows a similar increase in initial entry training for soldiers in infantry specialties initiated in FY 2020.

The  procurement  request  supports  modernization  of  Bradley, Stryker, Abrams, and Paladin combat vehicles; acquisition of critical  missile  air  defense  systems;  and  accelerating  key  network modernization programs. The research, development, test, and evaluation request focuses on the capabilities the Army needs for largescale  ground  combat.  Its  largest  programs  are  long-range  precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, and air and missile defense.

The OCO request continues Army support to Operation Freedom's sentinel ,  Operation inherent resolve ,  Operation spartan shield , and  the  European  Deterrence  Initiative.  It  continues  funding  for Afghanistan security and defense forces and for countering ISIS by building key security force capabilities to promote long-term stability of the Middle East region.

The  Army  began  FY  2021  without  an  approved  budget.  The congressional continuing resolution that enabled the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2020 levels for both the base and the OCO budgets. The continuing resolution did not extend defense emergency funding for natural disasters or response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## The Army People Strategy

In October 2019, HQDA released The Army People Strategy .  The Army based it on the understanding that individuals will ensure the service remains the world's most ready and capable land combat force. The strategy defines 'Army People' as the soldiers in all three components, their families, the service's civilian employees, and retirees and veterans. The Army People Strategy sets out how the service will acquire, develop, employ, and retain the diversity of soldier and civilian talent needed to achieve its readiness, modernization, and reform objectives.

Crucial  to  implementing  the  strategy  is  a  shift  from  simply distributing personnel to deliberately managing the talents that soldiers and civilians possess. 'Talent' is the intersection of three dimensionsskills,  knowledge,  and  behaviors-that  creates  an  optimal  level  of individual  performance,  provided  the  Army  employs  individuals within their talent sets. All people possess talents that the Army can identify  and cultivate.  Individuals  can  extend  their  talent  advantage dramatically  and  continuously  if  the  Army  properly  develops  them and employs them on the right teams. To optimize performance, the Army must recognize that each soldier and civilian employee possesses a unique distribution of skills, knowledge, and behaviors. The Army requires talent management to help reach its overall strategic personnel objectives of enhancing readiness, sustaining a workforce of trusted professionals, and ensuring it has diverse and integrated teams. Talent management mitigates one of the greatest risks posed by an uncertain operating environment: a mismatch in people and requirements. It also will permit the Army to compete better for talented people in the wider American labor market.

In March 2020, the service published The Army People Strategy: Prevention  of  Sexual  Harassment  and  Sexual  Assault  Annex .  This annex outlines the conditions necessary to accomplish the prevention of sexual harassment and sexual assault across the Army. It describes the methods, resources, and conditions to achieve those outcomes.

In September 2020, the service published The Army People Strategy: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Annex . The Army defines diversity as

all  attributes,  experiences, cultures, characteristics, and backgrounds of the total force that are reflective of the nation it serves and enable the Army to accomplish its assigned missions. The Army defines equity as the fair treatment, access, opportunity, choice, and advancement for all its personnel while striving to identify and eliminate barriers that would prevent full participation of the total force. The Army defines inclusion as the process of valuing and integrating each individual's perspectives,  ideas,  and  contributions  into  the  way  an  organization functions and makes decisions, thereby enabling its personnel to achieve their full potential in pursuit of organizational objectives.This annex provides  direction  for  organizational,  command  climate,  structural, and procedural changes to enable the Army to become a model of diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion.  It  supersedes  the  Army  Diversity Roadmap published in 2011 and fulfills the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization  Act  mandate  to  develop  a  five-year  diversity  and inclusion strategic plan. The annex contains five goals: demonstrate leader commitment, engagement, and support to diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels of the Army; institutionalize talent management processes  to  acquire,  develop,  employ,  and  retain  high-performing personnel  who  will  provide  diversity  in  senior  military  and  civilian leadership; establish and resource a governance structure to support Army  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  efforts;  implement  diversity, equity,  and  inclusion  training  and  education  programs;  and  create and maintain an equitable and inclusive environment where diverse attributes, experiences,  cultures, characteristics, and  backgrounds ensure  mission  readiness.  The  annex  describes  how  the  Army  will achieve these 5 goals through 25 associated objectives and over 100 action tasks.

The  secretary  of  the  Army  chartered  the  Quality  of  Life  Task Force in March 2020. The task force, led by HQDA's deputy chief of staff, G-9, developed a campaign plan, nested within the Army People Strategy, for a comprehensive approach to strengthening quality of life programs across the Army. The plan consists of 6 lines of effort, 31 objectives, and over 200 tasks. The six lines of effort are housing; health care;  child  care;  spouse  employment;  permanent  change  of  station moves; and bolstering facilities and programs at remote installations with critical quality of life needs.

## Army Strength and Distribution

As  of  30  September  2020,  the  service  had  1,010,215  soldiers.  The RA's end strength was 485,383: 78,641 commissioned officers, 14,341 warrant  officers,  387,911  enlisted,  and  4,490  cadets  enrolled  at  the

United  States  Military  Academy.  The  end  strength  of  the  ARNG was  336,129:  37,062  commissioned  officers,  8,786  warrant  officers, and 290,281 enlisted. The USAR's end strength was 188,703: 35,598 commissioned officers,  3,621  warrant  officers,  and  149,484  enlisted. Women constituted 16 percent of the RA, 19 percent of the ARNG, and 25 percent of the USAR. Racial and ethnic minorities constituted 42 percent of the RA, 30 percent of the ARNG, and 46 percent of the USAR. Twenty-four percent of United States Military Academy cadets were women, and 36 percent were racial or ethnic minorities.

## Officers

The Army accessioned 11,495 new officers in FY 2020. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), with 5,373, accounted for the largest share.  It  commissioned  2,935  into  the  RA,  1,703  into  the  ARNG, and 735 into  the  USAR.  An  additional  72  officers  entered  the  RA through the ROTC education delay and early commissioning options. The United States Military Academy produced 1,060 officers for the RA.  In-service  Officer  Candidate  School  (OCS)  commissioned  319 lieutenants: 176 in the RA and 143 in the USAR. The college-option OCS program produced 1,056 lieutenants: 823 for the RA and 233 for the USAR. The Call to Active Duty program and interservice transfers brought 41 new officers into the RA from the reserve components. The ARNG's state-based OCS programs commissioned 576 officers, and an additional 100 lieutenants joined the ARNG after graduating from the federal OCS.

There were 3,231 direct commissions in this fiscal year. Thirteen were into one of the basic branches of the Army. The Judge Advocate General  had  260:  156  RA,  57  USAR,  and  47  ARNG.  The  Army Medical  Department  had  2,351:  1,185  RA,  733  USAR,  and  433 ARNG. The Chaplain Corps had 274: 116 RA, 95 USAR, and 63 ARNG. There were 333 RA officers commissioned into the Medical Service Corps and the Army Nurse Corps.

Diversity within the active component officer corps was similar to recent fiscal years ( Table 7 ).

In  the  RA  commissioned  officer  corps,  51  percent  of  women and  66  percent  of  men  were  married.  In  the  warrant  officer  corps, 59 percent of women and 85 percent of men were married. Among commissioned officers, 6 percent of women and 3 percent of men were single with children. In the warrant officer corps, 18 percent of women and 6 percent of men were single with children.

In the ARNG commissioned officer corps, 46 percent of women and  64  percent  of  men  were  married.  In  the  warrant  officer  corps, 54  percent  of  women  and  79  percent  of  men  were  married.  Nine percent of women and 5 percent of men among commissioned officers were single with children. In the warrant officer corps, 14 percent of women and 6 percent of men were single with children.

In the USAR commissioned officer corps, 51 percent of women and 68 percent of men were married. In the USAR warrant officer corps,  57  percent  of  women  and  70  percent  of  men  were  married. Among commissioned officers, 9 percent of women and 5 percent of men were single with children. In the warrant officer corps, 12 percent of women and 7 percent of men were single with children.

Officer Assignment Cycle 20-02 was the first to implement fully the  Army  Talent  Alignment  Process  (ATAP)  and  its  marketplace through the Army Interactive Module (AIM) 2.0 system. The ATAP is a decentralized, regulated, market-style hiring system that matches officers  with  units  based  on  officers'  knowledge,  skills,  behaviors, and preferences. Officers use the AIM 2.0 to build a résumé and list their next preferred assignments and duty locations. Units use AIM 2.0 to post expected vacancies and the specific requirements for those positions. Units also can reach out to officers and conduct interviews to understand better if they are a good fit for one another. Once the market closes and all preferences are set, ATAP uses the Army Talent Alignment Algorithm to match officers with assignments.

The ATAP for Officer Assignment Cycle 20-02 opened for data input on 1 October 2019. By the time the market for this cycle closed on  6  December,  14,482  officers  had  submitted  873,933  preferences for  14,690  potential  assignments  and  units  had  submitted  137,903 preferences for officers. At the end of the first ATAP cycle, 67 percent of officers received one of their top three assignments, and 66 percent of Army units received one of their top three choices for open positions. Of the matches in the ATAP marketplace, 45 percent were one-to-one matches, meaning both the officer and the unit selected each other as their top choice in AIM 2.0. COVID-19 significantly curtailed Officer Assignment Cycle 21-01. On 4 May 2020, the Army limited this cycle to the command selection list; emergency reassignments for personal reasons;  reassignments  needed  to  meet  HQDA  Directed  Readiness

Requirements; and officers moving into or out of professional military education courses. The 21-02 Officer Assignment Cycle will open early in FY 2021 and the Army expects over 15,000 officers to be involved.

The FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act gave the military services  the  authority  to  allow  commissioned  officers  to  opt  out  of a promotion board for up to two years without penalty to complete graduate school, a broadening assignment, or a unique duty deemed critical to the service. The Army first applied this authority with the FY 2020 Army Competitive Category Lieutenant Colonel promotion selection  board.  The  Army  will  expand  the  program  to  the  reserve components in FY 2021.

The  Army  in  FY  2020  implemented  a  program  that  permits officers to compete for promotion early as long as they have completed certain  key  milestones,  such  as  professional  military  education  and developmental assignments, required for that rank. This change allows the Army to recognize officers who show potential for a rank but who are below the established zone for consideration for promotion to that rank. Any officer meeting the qualifications for a rank can opt in to the  selection  process  by  submitting  a  formal  request  through  AIM 2.0. Voluntarily opting in early does not count as one of an officer's two  mandatory  considerations  for  promotion.  Majors  competing for  promotion  to  lieutenant  colonel  in  the  Information  Dominance Competitive Category were the first group permitted to opt in; eighteen of twenty-five eligible officers opted in. Army Competitive Category captains competing for promotion to major were the next group; 1,007 requested  to  opt  in  and  916  met  the  eligibility  requirements.  Other promotion boards will be included in the program during FY 2021.

The FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act gave the military services the authority to promote temporarily an officer to fill a critical position, an authority known as a 'brevet promotion.' Officers with a  brevet  promotion can wear the rank of the next highest grade as well as receive all pay and benefits of the new grade. The Army began using  this  authority  in  FY  2020,  identifying  225  brevet  promotions and completing more than 170 by the end of the fiscal year.

The  Army  implemented  the  Battalion  Commander  Assessment Program  (BCAP)  in  FY  2020  after  conducting  a  pilot  version  in FY 2019. The BCAP offers a new way to assess an officer's fitness for battalion command. Officers on the Lieutenant Colonel Centralized Selection List attend the program. The BCAP consists of a series of cognitive,  noncognitive,  physical,  verbal,  and  written  assessments, along with peer and subordinate feedback on the officers. The Army Comprehensive  Talent  Interview  (ACTI)  is  the  culminating  event of  BCAP.  A  panel  of  senior  officers,  a  senior  psychologist,  and  a

former battalion command sergeant major conduct the interview. The panel scores each officer's verbal communication and determines his or her readiness for command based on the entirety of the BCAP's assessments.  The  ACTI  involves  a  double-blind  panel  interview  in which a curtain separates the officer from the panel.

The  Army  uses  the  BCAP  assessment  to  modify  the  order  of merit  list  produced  by  the  Centralized  Selection  List  board.  The service then uses the revised order of merit list to select officers for battalion command and other billets. The FY 2020 BCAP resulted in a 34 percent change to the principals for battalion command and key billets. The assessment determined that twenty-five officers were not yet ready to command at the battalion level.

The inaugural Colonels Command Assessment Program (CCAP) took place in September 2020 at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Officers who had opted into the FY 2022 Colonels Active Competitive Category Centralized  Selection  List  attended.  Though  similar  to  the  BCAP, the CCAP replaced the Leadership Reaction Course used in BCAP with a strategic leadership exercise to assess better an officer's strategic aptitude.  Three  hundred  nineteen  colonels  participated  in  CCAP, and the Army will release the results in early FY 2021. Officers who chose not to attend or who do not receive an exemption will not be eligible for command or key billets in FY 2022. The Army will remove officers found not ready for command at CCAP from consideration for command or key billets. If eligible, officers may compete the next year.

## Enlisted Personnel

The RA achieved its recruiting and retention objectives in FY 2020. After  failing  to  meet  its  recruiting  goal  in  FY  2017,  the  Army instituted a series of revisions to its recruiting process. Army Recruiting  Command  focused  on  twenty-two  urban  areas  to  bring in  new  recruits  and  expanded  its  digital  outreach.  The  command planned and executed a national hiring day event in the summer of 2020  to  reach  over  30,000  individuals  interested  in  military  service. In March 2020, the Army closed its recruiting stations in response to the pandemic. Army recruiters, nonetheless, utilized virtual and social media avenues to reach potential recruits. This allowed recruiters to engage with applicants interested in the Army without the need for face-to-face interaction. Because of these efforts, the RA accessioned 62,251 recruits in FY 2020. It reenlisted 53,024 soldiers whose term of service was set to expire in FY 2020, 105 percent of its objective.

The ARNG sought 42,730 enlistees and enlisted 42,730 people. The  USAR  sought  15,850  enlistees  and  enlisted  13,706  people. As  with  the  RA,  the  closure  of  the  reserve  components'  recruiting stations  because  of  the  pandemic  impeded  enlisting  those  with  no prior  military  service.  Another  effect  of  the  pandemic  on  reserve components' recruiting was that many RA soldiers chose to extend their active duty service rather than transition to a civilian life with unsure employment opportunities. The RA encouraged this trend by offering soldiers a one-year extension in lieu of a standard six-year reenlistment during the pandemic. Another factor also affected USAR recruiting  from  the  RA.  In  December  2019,  the  ARNG  decided  to offer $20,000 bonuses to RA soldiers who transitioned to the Guard on  a  three-year  contract  under  the  Active  Component-to-Reserve Component  (AC2RC)  program.  The  USAR  also  offered  a  $20,000 AC2RC bonus, but with  a  six-year  commitment.  This  difference  in commitment length led 75 percent of former RA soldiers who joined a reserve component after leaving active service to select the ARNG rather than the USAR. With far fewer former RA soldiers joining it, the USAR had to return $30 million of its funding budgeted for the AC2RC program in FY 2020.

In the RA, 44 percent of enlisted women and 49 percent of enlisted men were married. Ten percent of enlisted women and 4 percent of enlisted men were single with children.

In the ARNG, 20 percent of enlisted women and 35 percent of enlisted  men  were  married.  Twelve  percent  of  enlisted  women  and 8 percent of enlisted men were single with children.

In  the  USAR, 30 percent of enlisted women and 43 percent of enlisted men were married. Fourteen percent of enlisted women and 7 percent for enlisted men were single with children.

Human  Resources  Command  (HRC)  linked  the  Assignment Satisfaction  Key-Enlisted  Marketplace  (ASK-EM)  program  to  the enlisted  assignment  cycle.  This  initiative  enabled  mid-  to  late-career noncommissioned officers  a  greater  voice  in  their  assignments  with increased  predictability  within  the  assignment  process.  During  two FY  2020  pilots,  sergeants  first  class  and  above  used  ASK-EM  to list  their  top  three  preferred  assignments  in  the  United  States  and their  top  three  preferred  assignments  overseas.  HRC  then  matched these  preferences  against  readiness  requirements  and  then  input  the preferences into a new enlisted assignment cycle construct. It shifted from a weekly cycle to a deliberative process with nine cycles per year. This change enabled the identification of personnel movement with longer  lead  times,  which  offered  more  predictability  to  soldiers  and commands. After the successful pilot efforts in FY 2020, HRC will implement the ASK-EM process early in FY 2021.

## Civilian Personnel

At  the  end  of  FY  2020,  the  Army  had  272,043  appropriated  fund civilian employees and 24,766 nonappropriated-fund employees ( Table 11 ).  During  FY  2020,  minorities  accounted  for  32  percent  of  the civilian workforce, veterans 50 percent, disabled persons 12 percent, and women 36 percent. The median age of Army civilians was 49.

In  May  2020,  the  Army  instituted  the  Civilian  Implementation Plan  (CIP)  as  part  of The  Army  People  Strategy .  The  CIP  is  one aspect  of  the  larger  talent-management  reform  effort  designed  to reshape  the  way  the  Army  acquires,  develops,  employs,  and  retains its civilian workforce. To accomplish this, the CIP has four priorities: transform  workforce  planning  and  management;  modernize  civilian talent  acquisition;  evolve  career  programs;  and  create  world-class supervisors.  As  with  other  talent  management  programs,  the  CIP utilizes  a  data-driven  approach  to  align  an  employee's  knowledge, skills, and behaviors to the optimal job and position. Leaders can use that data in the future to reward high performance. The Army believes a renewed approach to civilian talent management is necessary because it is competing for the most talented people in various fields with other federal agencies and the private sector. Most Army organizations rely on the civilian workforce. In some organizations, the majority of the workforce are civilians. These include Army Materiel Command, Army Medical  Command,  and  the  Corps  of  Engineers,  where  the  civilian workforce  comprises  99  percent,  78  percent,  and  98  percent  of  the workforce, respectively.

In addition to implementing the CIP, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) implemented a career program restructuring that transferred personnel and resources from several commands and HQDA to the Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA) in FY 2020. The reorganization stemmed from the Civilian Implementation Plan and an Army Reform Initiative effort designed to reduce time required to hire new civilian employees. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) consolidated thirty-two existing career programs into eleven broad career field  programs:  Technology; Science, Engineering, and Analysis; Construction Engineering; Logistics; Installations; Medical; Security and Intelligence; Human Capital and Resource Management; Education  and  Information  Science;  Contracting;  and  Professional Services. A new organization under CHRA, the U.S. Army Civilian Career  Management  Activity,  became  responsible  for  Army-wide civilian talent management.

In FY 2020, CHRA's workload remained relatively high despite the pandemic. Nevertheless, the average time-to-fill vacancies decreased  during  the  fiscal  year.  The  Army  measures  time-to-fill from the initiation of the request for personnel action to entrance on duty of the employee who will fill the vacancy. In FY 2018, CHRA received  102,992  actions,  107,966  actions  in  FY  2019,  and  104,307 actions in FY 2020. The average time-to-fill for all competitive and

noncompetitive actions decreased from 93.8 days in FY 2018 to 90.6 days in FY 2019 to 83.4 days in FY 2020.

## Special Topics

Spc. Vanessa Guillén, a soldier assigned to 3d Cavalry Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas, went missing on 22 April 2020. A fellow soldier had murdered her on that day. Then the murderer and an accomplice removed Specialist Guillén's body from Fort Hood, dismembered it, and buried the remains. Specialist Guillén's disappearance triggered a  massive  search  on  and  off  post.  There  also  was  extensive  public interest in her disappearance, especially in social media, driven in part by reports that leaders in her unit had ignored the sexual harassment of Specialist Guillén. On 30 June, workers discovered partial human remains near the Leon River. The murderer killed himself on 1 July when confronted by law enforcement officers. On 5 July, authorities confirmed the remains as those of Specialist Guillén.

On 10 July, the secretary of the Army announced that he would appoint five civilians to a Fort Hood Independent Review Committee. The purpose of this independent review is to determine whether the

command  climate  and  culture  at  Fort  Hood,  and  the  surrounding community, reflect the Army's values. The panel will review historical data and conduct interviews with soldiers and civilians. A brigadier general and a staff will assist the panel with administrative, logistical, and media support. The committee will make a report of its findings and recommendations in early FY 2021. The under secretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff, Army, will cochair an implementation team  to  consider  the  committee's  recommendations  and  implement changes, as appropriate.

On 1 September 2020, the commanding general, Forces Command, appointed the commanding general, AFC, as an investigating officer pursuant to Army Regulation 15-6. The investigation will evaluate Fort Hood leaders at various echelons and their responses to the disappearance and murder of Specialist Guillén. It also will examine several collateral issues:  the  sexual  harassment  of  Specialist  Guillén;  the  alleged  sexual harassment  committed  by  her  murderer;  the  3d  Cavalry  Regiment's Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Prevention (SHARP) program; the regiment's accountability of personnel; the regiment's procedures for personnel assignments; and the regiment's arms room procedures. The  investigation  was  still  underway  at  the  end  of  FY  2020.  The commanding  general,  Forces  Command,  relieved  the  acting  senior commander of Fort Hood on 2 September.

One  pandemic  mitigation  measure  was  a  shift  to  telework  for those  soldiers  and  civilian  employees  in  positions  that  permitted them to continue to perform their duties away from offices. The Army implemented virtual promotion boards and civilian employee hiring panels  to  reduce  person-to-person  contact.  It  also  suspended  some enlisted  promotion  requirements,  such  as  attendance  at  in-person courses, for ARNG soldiers. Because of a DoD-imposed travel ban, HQDA on 15 April suspended performance requirements for soldiers receiving performance-based special or incentive pays for a period not to exceed twelve months. The Army instituted exceptions-to-policy for some administrative requirements, most notably for any person whose Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  expired  after  30  April  2020.  These persons could request a temporary extension until 30 September 2020 before having to go to a CAC office for a replacement card.

In June 2020, the Army announced the start of Project Inclusion. The project's purpose is to implement programs and policies to achieve the objectives and goals set out in The Army People Strategy: Diversity, Equity,  and  Inclusion  Annex .  The  Army  will  conduct  the  project  in tranches.  Tranche  One  has  ten  tasks,  including  training,  listening sessions,  cohort-specific  diversity  implementation  plans,  and  review

of policies, one of which is to ensure fairness and impartiality in the military justice process.

In July 2020, after a five-year process, HQDA published a major revision  of Army  Regulation  600-20:  Army  Command  Policy ,  that superseded the edition issued in 2014 and a set of Army Directives issued  between  2011  and  2019.  Changes  included  clarifying  the reporting requirements for commanders regarding domestic violence; establishing  a  chain  of  command  for  granting  religious  accommodations to  soldiers;  and  updating  the  SHARP  reporting  process.  The  new edition  added  policy  on  extremist  organizations,  cyber  activity,  and social media. It added policy for command of installations, activities, and units on joint bases. It specified the authority to correct minor acts of indiscipline with brief physical exercise, such as requiring soldiers to do push-ups when arriving late to a formation.

During FY 2020, the Army Resiliency Directorate in the Office of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Manpower  and  Reserve Affairs)  began  working  on  a  comprehensive  plan  to  prevent  sexual harassment  and  sexual  assault.  The  directorate  expects  its  Primary Prevention Plan of Action to be completed in December 2022. The plan will focus on the three domains of a prevention system-human resources, partnerships, and infrastructure-and the actions necessary to address gaps in the Army's current system by building capacity. The plan  will  nest  within  and  enable  the  Army's  implementation  of  the DoD Primary Prevention Plan of Action published in May 2019.

In  phase  one  of  preparing  the  plan,  the  DoD  Sexual  Assault Prevention and Response Office provided the services and the National Guard Bureau with criteria to draft a self-assessment to identify gaps and strengths. The Army identified delinquencies in its data collection and a lack of prevention guidance as its gaps. In phase two, the Army Resiliency  Directorate  developed  a  plan-of-action  matrix  and  logic model to address the service's shortcomings. The assistant secretary of the Army (manpower and reserve affairs) approved the matrix and the model in May 2020. With these phases complete, the Army Resiliency Directorate had a data collection model in place to focus on sexual assault and harassment prevention going forward.

During  FY  2020,  the  Army's  SHARP  Academy  trained  192 students: 158 in the Career Course, 18 in the Trainer Course, and 16 in the Program Managers' Course. The academy supported 146 SHARP Foundation Courses (81 were distance learning and 65 were in-person) that trained 3,434 soldiers and Army civilian employees. The academy delivered two SHARP online training products to the Drill Sergeant Academy. It also released version 12 of the SHARP Annual Refresher Training Support Package to the Army.

To ensure that officer, warrant officer, and enlisted selection boards are as fair and impartial as possible, in August 2020 the Army made two changes to the personnel files reviewed by these boards. The first removed  the  official  Department  of  the  Army  photograph  of  the individual from these files. The second redacted all data that identify a soldier's race, ethnicity, and gender on the Officer Record Brief and the Enlisted Record Brief that are included in the file reviewed by a board.

The Army continued implementation of the Integrated Personnel and  Pay  System-Army  (IPPS-A),  a  web-based  human  resource platform  that  supports  total  force  visibility,  talent  management, and auditability. IPPS-A Release 1 began in FY 2015 and continued through the end of FY 2018. It interfaced with fifteen separate pay systems used across the Army and built the foundational database of personnel data for future releases. In FY 2020, the Army completed the fielding of IPPS-A Release 2, which had begun in FY 2019. This release  collapsed  separate  ARNG  pay  systems  into  a  single  system and provided mobile self-service capability to Guard soldiers. IPSS-A Release 3 will begin in FY 2021. It will provide the capabilities currently supported by the major field systems for the RA and the USAR, and subsume approximately thirty-four human resource and pay systems.

In February 2020, the chief of staff, Army, approved the wearing of shoulder sleeve insignia-former wartime service, commonly known as a combat patch, for soldiers who served in Somalia after 1 January 2004. Soldiers with a Somalia deployment also needed to have received a combat zone tax exclusion and either hostile fire or imminent danger pay to be eligible to wear the insignia.

In  November  2018,  the  Army  announced  it  would  field  a  new service uniform-the 'Army Greens'-based on the uniform used by the Army during World War II. The Army Blues uniform will return to  a  formal  dress  uniform,  whereas  the  Army  Greens  will  become the everyday business uniform for all soldiers. In FY 2020, the Army began issuing the Army Greens to Army Recruiting College graduates, drill sergeants, and the Army Band. The Army plans to begin issuing the uniform to new recruits early in FY 2021. The uniform will also be  available  for  purchase  at  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service (AAFES) uniform stores in early 2021. Wearing of the Army Greens will become mandatory in 2027.

The  Army  Review  Boards  Agency  (ARBA)  continued  to  focus on  eliminating  the  FY  2016-FY  2018  case  backlog  that  exceeded congressionally  mandated  standards  of  timeliness.  Because  of  this effort, ARBA has reduced this backlog from 14,000 in FY 2018 to fewer than 700 at the end of FY 2020. In addition to this work, in FY 2020 the agency processed 1,274 cases for the Physical Disability Board; 39

cases for the Officer Special Selection Board; 189 cases for the Army Grade Determination Board; 43 cases for Army Special Review Board (Evaluations and Appeals); 258 cases for the Department of the Army Suitability Evaluation Board; and 1,488 cases for the Army Discharge Review Board.

## Medal of Honor

M. Sgt. Matthew O. Williams received the Medal of Honor in October 2019 for his actions on 6 April 2008 in the Shok Valley, Nuristan Province, Afghanistan, while assigned to Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, Special Operations Task Force 11, Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Afghanistan. Then a Sergeant, Williams was on a  mission to capture or kill high-value targets of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin militant group. As Williams's team moved up a mountain toward their target, they came under heavy fire from enemy machine

guns, snipers, and rocket-propelled grenades. Sergeant Williams was in the trailing portion of the patrol when he learned that enemy fire had pinned down the lead element and that they had incurred heavy casualties. He gathered a small team and moved to assist the besieged element. Williams exposed himself to enemy fire on numerous occasions while providing first aid to wounded soldiers and moving them to casualty collection points. While doing this, he provided suppressing fire and killed numerous enemy insurgents. He also led numerous counterattacks as the enemy threatened to overrun the casualty collection point. Sergeant Williams kept the enemy at bay long enough for helicopters to arrive to evacuate the wounded.

Sgt.  Maj.  Thomas  P .  Payne  received  the  Medal  of  Honor  in September  2020  for  his  actions  on  22  October  2015  while  serving with a special operations joint task force in Al Hawijah, Iraq. Then a Sergeant First Class, Payne was an assistant team leader in a combined American and Kurdish task force sent to rescue more than seventy Iraqi hostages held by ISIS. After air assaulting into the target area, Payne led a team charged with clearing one of the two buildings that held the hostages. They quickly cleared the building amid heavy enemy fire.

After liberating thirty-eight hostages, Sergeant Payne heard a request for assistance at the second building. Acting on his own initiative, he rushed  across  the  compound,  climbed  a  ladder  onto  the  building's partially enflamed roof and engaged the ISIS fighters below. He then moved back to the ground and engaged enemy forces through a breach hole in the building. Knowing time was running out for the hostages, Payne rushed through the burning building with bolt cutters and cut the lock on the door. Other team members followed Payne's lead and the  task  force  rescued  an  additional  thirty-seven  hostages.  Sergeant Payne then facilitated the evacuation of the hostages by helicopter.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Force development is the process of determining Army doctrine, leader development, training, organization, soldier development, and materiel requirements  and  translating  them  into  programs  and  structures, within allocated resources to accomplish Army missions and functions. It  supports  Army  Campaign  Plan  objectives  through  preparation  of doctrine, modernization of equipment, and training programs.

During FY 2020, the service continued to implement the 'Army Vision' and The Army Strategy published in October 2018. The Army Vision stated that the Army of 2028 will be ready to deploy, fight, and win decisively against any adversary, anytime and anywhere, in a joint, multidomain,  high-intensity  conflict,  while  simultaneously  deterring others and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare. The Army Strategy articulated how the service would achieve this vision over  the  next  ten  years.  It  stated  the  Army's  central  challenge  was using  finite  resources  to  remain  ready  to  fight  while  simultaneously modernizing  and  preparing  for  a  fundamentally  different  future. The  strategy  set  forth  a  phased  approach  focused  on  readiness, modernization,  institutional  reform,  and  maintaining  alliances  and partnerships. Underpinning this strategic approach was an enduring commitment to taking care of the Army's people and upholding the Army Values.

## Readiness

In  May  2020,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  approved  the  Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model (ReARMM). This new model  provides  a  flexible,  predictable  force  generation  process  that creates a regionally and functionally aligned Army. A key component of  ReARMM is a predictable window for units to field the modern capabilities necessary to build a multidomain-capable Army, while at the same time continuing to provide a predictable supply of ready units to the joint force. The new model provides greater certainty for training, reserve components, logistical requirements, and personnel managers.

Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model



The readiness of the Army's BCTs also remained steady, despite the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of FY 2020, half of the Army's fifty-eight RA and ARNG BCTs were at the highest level of readiness.

## Doctrine and Future Force

In  July  2020,  AFC  published  AFC  Pamphlet  71-20-1, Army  Futures Command  Concept  for  Maneuver  in  Multi-Domain  Operations,  2028 . This  pamphlet,  together  with  AFC  Pamphlet  71-20-2, Army  Futures Command Concept for Brigade Combat Team Cross-Domain Maneuver 2028 ,  superseded TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-5, The U.S. Army Functional Concept for Movement and Maneuver , published in February 2017.

Army Futures Command Concept for Maneuver in Multi-Domain Operations, 2028 , is nested firmly within multidomain operations, yet also expands on them, accounting for two years of global operational experience, institutional study, war-gaming, and experimentation. The pamphlet describes how Army forces will conduct maneuver within an operational context that includes contested battlefields and domains, integrated adversary defenses with stand-off weapons, operational and strategic deterrence challenges, and multinational and governmental collaboration. The central idea in this concept is that success depends on simultaneous multiechelon convergence from all domains. In this concept,  maneuver  occurs  simultaneously  at  every  echelon  through

division,  corps,  and  higher.  Maneuver  happens  in  competition  and during a return to competition, not just armed conflict.

Army  Futures  Command  Concept  for  Brigade  Combat  Team Cross-Domain  Maneuver  2028 ,  published  in  August  2020,  describes the changes necessary for BCTs to support multidomain operations. It defines  cross-domain  maneuver  as  the  tactical  application  of multidomain  operations  executed  by  BCTs  to  compete  and  shape the  security  environment,  deter  adversaries,  and,  when  necessary, dominate and win in armed conflict. This concept serves as a basis for modernization actions for the BCTs and identifies implications for other supporting and enabling formations.

AFC  Pamphlet 71-20-3, Army Futures Command Concept for  Intelligence,  2028 , and  AFC  Pamphlet  71-20-4, Army  Futures Command  Concept  for  Special  Operations,  2028 ,  both  published  in September 2020, describe the key challenges, solutions, and supporting capabilities required for Army intelligence and Army special operations forces  to  support  multidomain  operations  across  the  competition continuum  against  near-peer  competitors.  The  pamphlets  serve  as a  basis  for  modernization  actions  for  Army  intelligence  and  Army special operations forces. The two pamphlets also identify implications for other supporting and enabling functions. Army Futures Command Concept for Intelligence, 2028 ,  superseded TRADOC Pamphlet 5252-1, The  U.S.  Army  Functional  Concept  for  Intelligence,  2020-2040 , published in 2017.

AFC  launched  Project  Convergence  in  2020  as  the  service's campaign  of  learning  to  ensure  that  Army  forces,  as  part  of  the joint  force,  can  rapidly  and  continuously  integrate  or  'converge' effects across all domains-air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace-to overmatch adversaries both in competition and in conflict. The project is a continuous, structured series of demonstrations and experiments, and AFC designed it around five core components: people; weapon systems; command and control; information; and terrain.

More than 800 persons took part in a Project Convergence exercise during  August  and  September  2020.  It  included  demonstrations from several  of  AFC's  cross-functional  teams,  the  Army's  Artificial Intelligence  Task  Force,  and  the  Combat  Capabilities  Development Command.  Throughout  the  exercise,  air,  land,  and  space  sensors tracked targets, processed data, and sent that data to weapon systems on  the  ground.  Among  the  capabilities  demonstrated  during  the exercise  were  significant  decreases  in  sensor-to-weapon  processing time  and  execution;  an  Army  division  battlespace  extended  to  over 60  kilometers;  autonomous  air-ground  three-dimensional  mapping,

reconnaissance, flight, and weapons launch; and artificial intelligenceaided threat detection and recognition.

During FY 2020, the Army continued to refine its multidomain operational  concepts  through  the  multidomain  task  force  program. The program, established in FY 2017, initially focused on defeating an  adversary's  antiaccess/area  denial  capabilities  in  the  Indo-Pacific region using a field artillery brigade augmented with an Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electric and Space detachment. This first multidomain  task  force  has  participated  in  numerous  exercises  and assessments.  During  FY  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  delayed plans  to  establish  a  task  force  in  Europe  for  testing  multidomain operations concepts there. Nevertheless, the Army remains committed to establishing a European-based multidomain task force in 2021 and a  second  Pacific-oriented  one  in  2022.  By  FY  2026,  the  Army  will expand the first experimental multidomain task force to its full design. The  full  design  will  incorporate  organic  long-range  fires;  air  and missile defense; expanded cyber, electronic warfare, and surveillance capabilities; space assets; and an increased sustainment component.

## Force Structure

The  total  number  of  BCTs  remained  constant  at  fifty-eight,  with thirty-one in the RA and twenty-seven in the ARNG. In June 2020, the 2d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, completed its conversion from an infantry BCT to a Stryker BCT. This brought the mix of BCTs in the RA to eleven armored, thirteen infantry, and seven Stryker. The types of BCTs in the ARNG remained unchanged at five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker.

During FY 2020, the Army finished bringing the last three of its six security force assistance brigades (SFABs), the 4th, 5th, and 54th SFABs,  to  full  operational  capacity.  The  brigades  will  advise  and assist  partner  nations  in  developing  their  security  force  capabilities and  help  preserve  the  Army's  irregular  warfare  competencies.  The Army also worked to align each brigade with a geographic combatant command. The 1st SFAB at Fort Benning, Georgia, will be aligned with U.S. Southern Command. The 2d SFAB at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will be aligned with U.S. Africa Command. The 3d SFAB at Fort Hood will be aligned with U.S. Central Command. The 4th SFAB at Fort Carson, Colorado, will be aligned with U.S. European Command. The 5th SFAB at Fort Lewis, Washington, will be aligned with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The 54th SFAB, an ARNG brigade with battalions in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Texas,

will be aligned to U.S. Northern Command and will reinforce the five RA brigades. Future overseas deployments of SFABs now will consist predominantly of smaller formations of twelve to forty  soldiers,  as opposed to previous brigade-sized deployments.

The  Army  continued  to  increase  its  capabilities  against  nearpeer adversaries in large-scale combat. In February 2020, the service announced it would reactivate the V Corps headquarters at Fort Knox in October 2020. Approximately 200 of the unit's 635 soldiers will staff a forward command post in Poland on a rotational basis beginning early in FY 2021. This will provide a much-needed level of command and control for the U.S. Army and allied- and partner-nation tactical formations operating in Europe. The 1st Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Regiment,  activated  in  Europe  in  September  2020.  The  battalion, equipped  with  the  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System,  provides  U.S. Army, Europe, a second long-range fires unit.

The Army reassigned the 18th Medical Command of Fort Shafter, Hawai'i, from Army Medical Command to U.S. Army, Pacific, effective 16 September 2020. The action codified an informal relationship that had existed for some time and formally oriented the RA's only theaterlevel  operational  medical  command  toward  supporting  the  IndoPacific  region.  The  USAR's  311th  Signal  Command,  also  located at  Fort  Shafter,  established  a  provisional  expeditionary  contingency command  post  to  support  large-scale  ground  combat  operations, multidomain operations, and other critical requirements in U.S. IndoPacific Command's area of responsibility.

In October 2019, the Army announced that it would restore the 101st Airborne Division's full air assault capability. The division had been without its full air assault capability since December 2015, when one  of  its  aviation  brigades,  the  159th  Combat  Aviation  Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, inactivated. The effort aimed to reequip the division's remaining aviation brigade, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, with an additional thirty-six CH-47 Chinook helicopters by 2028.

The  1st  Special  Forces  Command,  as  part  of  its  vision  for the  command  in  the  near  future,  worked  to  reorganize  the  Crisis Response  Force  companies  resident  in  each  Special  Forces  group into  Hard  Target  Defeat  companies.  The  reason  for  this  change is  that  the  Crisis  Response  Force  companies,  which  focus  on  direct action, counterterrorism, and hostage rescue, were underutilized and duplicative of capabilities resident in other formations. The new Hard Target Defeat companies will focus instead on countering near-peer adversaries and operating with regional partners to defeat hard targets

in  sensitive  and  constricted  environments  such  as  underground  or urban environments.

The Army also began restructuring its intelligence assets for largescale combat against near-peer adversaries. In FY 2020, Army senior leaders approved a reorganization of the Army's expeditionary military intelligence brigades. Beginning in FY 2022, these brigades will shift dedicated  support  from  BCTs  to  division-  and  corps-level  support. The reorganized brigades will provide one intelligence and electronic warfare battalion to support corps headquarters and one intelligence and  electronic  warfare  battalion  to  support  division  headquarters with multidiscipline intelligence services. At the same time, the Army approved the inactivation of translator and interpreter platoons.

## Training

During  FY  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  disrupted  the  Army's collective  and  individual  training  programs.  Nevertheless,  the  Army met  many  of  its  training  requirements  and  continued  efforts  to improve  individual  and  collective  training.  On  18  March  2020,  the Army  postponed  rotations  to  the  National  Training  Center,  Fort Irwin,  California,  and  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center,  Fort Polk, Louisiana, to protect soldiers and to ensure that ARNG units were available for use by civil authorities in their local communities. Rotations resumed at the Joint Readiness Training Center in May and at the National Training Center in July after the training centers had implemented measures to protect rotating units and other personnel on the posts. During FY 2020, the Army conducted only thirteen of its planned eighteen combat training center rotations for BCTs.

The Army made significant changes to individual soldier training at  basic  combat  training  and  advanced  individual  training  centers because of the pandemic. On 6 April 2020, the Army announced a twoweek pause in sending recruits to basic training to give training centers time to establish testing and protective measures. This pause resulted in the delayed shipment of approximately 4,000 new recruits to basic combat training centers. Trainees already at basic or advanced training centers, however, continued their training. Training centers instituted various protection measures, such as quarantines to establish virtual safety  bubbles  around  new  recruits  and  trainees,  social  distancing measures,  maximal  use  of  outdoor  training  facilities,  and  limits  on soldiers' contact with individuals outside of their virtual safety bubble. On  22  April,  the  Army  resumed  shipping  recruits  to  basic  combat training. For two weeks before their ship date, the recruiters screened trainees  for  COVID-19  symptoms  or  possible  exposure  and  then

Military Entrance Processing Station personnel screened them again upon arrival. Training centers also began testing trainees for the virus upon their arrival once the Army had acquired sufficient COVID-19 testing systems.

Cadet  Command  made  changes  to  its  annual  summer  training programs for members of the ROTC. Cadets normally travel to Fort Knox each summer for the Basic Camp or the Advanced Camp. In May,  the  command  announced  the  cancellation  of  both  camps  for 2020 because of the pandemic. It moved most Advanced Camp tasks to either college campuses with an ROTC program or to Operation agile leader field-training exercises at a major military installation to be conducted in the late summer or early autumn of 2020. For the training tasks that cadets scheduled to commission in academic year 2021 could not do on campus, the cadets completed a two-week course that  included  a  leadership  field  training  exercise  and  select  soldier individual tasks. The Distributed Basic Camp program ensured cadets scheduled for the Basic Camp in summer 2020 received an additional program of instruction on-campus before the start of their fall 2020 semester to qualify them for Military Science Level III classes. Senior cadets that had completed all other commissioning requirements except

cadet  summer training  were  not  required  to  attend  training  at  Fort Knox and the Army commissioned them as scheduled. Cadet Command canceled the Nurse Summer Training Program and Cadet Troop Leader Training for summer 2020. The Army sent no cadets to badge producing courses such as airborne and air assault in summer 2020.

The  Maneuver  Center  of  Excellence  at  Fort  Benning  made  a number  of  changes  during  the  fiscal  year.  In  July  2020,  the  197th Infantry  Brigade  reactivated,  doubling  Fort  Benning's  capacity  to train recruits to serve in the infantry, as the Army made permanent the extension of infantry One Station Unit Training from fourteen to twenty-two weeks. (One Station Unit Training combines basic combat training and advanced individual training for a military specialty in the same class in one location.) The Armor school at Fort Benning also extended One Station Unit Training for armor crew and cavalry scouts from fifteen  and  seventeen  weeks,  respectively,  to  twenty-two  weeks for both. The Infantry and Armor Schools eliminated the decades-old, draft-era 'shark attack' initiation of new recruits by drill sergeants. The Army replaced this practice with new events better suited to an all-volunteer force that emphasizes teamwork and trust.

Work continued on implementing the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT)  despite  some  delays  caused  by  the  pandemic.  The  Army announced in June 2020 that the new six-event ACFT would become the service's physical fitness test of record effective 1 October 2020, replacing the forty-year-old, three-event Army  Physical Fitness Test.  However,  there  would  be  a  longer  than  previously  planned implementation  period.  Soldiers'  last  passing  of  the  Army  Physical Fitness Test of record would remain valid for any purpose requiring one  until  31  March  2022,  and  the  Army  would  take  no  adverse administrative actions against soldiers based on a failing ACFT until HQDA published further guidance. The Army also continued to make improvements  to  ACFT  events,  notably  allowing  soldiers  to  do  a plank exercise in lieu of a leg-tuck exercise. The Army referred to these changes as ACFT 2.0.

## Operational Forces

During FY 2020, Army units engaged in a variety of global operations and security assistance missions with multiple foreign partners. In March 2020, over 180,000 soldiers were serving in more than 140 countries. Soldiers also assisted with disaster relief, border security missions, domestic disorders, and the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Operational Forces: Afghanistan

Operation Freedom's sentinel in  Afghanistan continued to require significant Army support. American forces in Afghanistan have two missions: a counterterrorism mission against the remnants of al-Qaeda and a train, assist, and advise mission supporting Afghan security forces. In March 2020, there were over 10,000 soldiers supporting operations  in  Afghanistan.  By  September  2020,  the  total  American military presence had dropped to some 8,600 as part of an agreement signed by the United States and the Taliban on 29 February 2020 that aimed for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. During FY 2020, Army casualties for  this  operation  totaled  eleven killed and seventy-one wounded.

Elements of the 10th Mountain Division headquarters replaced elements  of  the  1st  Armored  Division  headquarters  in  June  2020, serving as part of a regular rotation of forces. Two BCTs, two SFABs, and two combat aviation brigades also served in Afghanistan during the  fiscal  year  to  assist  Afghan  forces.  The  3d  BCT,  82d  Airborne Division,  remained  in  Afghanistan  until  March  2020  when  the  1st BCT,  10th  Mountain  Division,  replaced  it.  In  November  2019,  the 2d SFAB handed over its responsibilities to advise and assist Afghan military partners to the 3d SFAB. The 3d SFAB returned to Fort Hood in September 2020. In November 2019, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th  Mountain  Division,  arrived  to  replace  the  Combat  Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Central

During  FY  2020,  the  Army  continued  to  play  a  prominent  role  in Iraq, Syria, and Kuwait. In March 2020, the Army had 27,500 soldiers supporting  operations  in Southwest  Asia.  The  most  significant operations occurred in the continuing fight against the remnants of ISIS as part of Operation inherent resolve .  Combined Joint Task Force-Operation inherent resolve (CJTF-OIR) maintained control of land operations. In addition, the Army maintained forces focused on theater-wide priorities as part of Operation spartan shield . Army casualties for FY 2020 in Operation inherent resolve totaled 8 killed and 143 wounded.

During  FY  2020,  coalition  forces  continued  to  advise,  train, and  assist  partners  to  eliminate  the  remnants  of  ISIS.  During  the

year,  CJTF-OIR  partnered  with  Iraqi  Security  Forces  and  Syrian Democratic  Forces  to  eliminate  ISIS  remnants.  Notable  activities included  a  raid  that  led  to  the  death  of  ISIS  leader  Abu  Bakr  alBaghdadi,  repositioning  of  troops  in  northeastern  Syria,  reducing U.S. military personnel in Iraq, and establishing the Enhanced Joint Operations  Center-Iraq  for  anti-ISIS  missions.  American  soldiers advised  regional  security  forces;  flew  aviation  missions;  patrolled contested  roads  in  Syria;  and  provided  logistics,  intelligence,  and communication support for the multinational coalition.

The Army sent air defense and immediate response forces to the region in response to heightened tensions with Iran. In October 2019, two  Patriot  missile  defense  batteries  and  a  Terminal  High  Altitude Area Defense battery deployed to Saudi Arabia. These forces were part of a larger buildup of forces in the region intended to deter Iranian aggression. They joined another Patriot battery and radars deployed to Saudi Arabia in September 2019 in response to Iran's attack on Saudi oil facilities. On 31 December, an Iranian-backed mob staged a violent protest  outside  of  the  U.S.  embassy  in  Baghdad  after  U.S.  military airstrikes against militia sites in Iraq. The next day, 750 soldiers from the 2d Battalion, 504th Infantry Regiment, part of the 1st BCT, 82d Airborne Division's Immediate Response Force, deployed to Kuwait in response. They were joined over the next several days by the remainder of  the  1st  BCT.  Paratroopers  from  the  Immediate  Response  Force later also replaced marines that had deployed to Baghdad to bolster the  embassy's  security.  The  82d  Airborne  Division  soldiers  began returning to Fort Bragg in late February 2020. In March, Army air and missile defense units moved from Saudi Arabia to Iraq in response to Iran's 8 January 2020 ballistic missile attack on a base in Iraq that hosted U.S. troops.

During  FY  2020,  the  Army  maintained  a  corps  headquarters, and  a  BCT  in  the  region  to  support  Operation inherent  resolve directly.  The  III  Corps  retained  responsibility  for  CJTF-OIR.  The BCT supported CJTF-OIR, including Iraqi and partner forces, with intelligence  support,  joint  fires,  aerial  surveillance,  and  training. In  June  2020,  the  2d  BCT,  82d  Airborne  Division,  assumed  these responsibilities  from  the  1st  BCT,  25th  Infantry  Division.  Elements of the 2d BCT, 82d Airborne Division, began returning to Fort Bragg in September 2020 as the total U.S. troop presence in Iraq decreased from 5,200 to 3,000 during the month. A portion of the 3d SFAB also served in northern Iraq on a mission to train, advise, assist, and enable local Kurdish Peshmerga security forces.

The  Army  maintained  a  division  headquarters,  an  armored BCT,  and  an  aviation  brigade  in  Kuwait  to  support  theater-wide

commitments as part of Operation spartan shield .  In March 2020, the  headquarters  of  the  42d  Infantry  Division  (New  Y ork  ARNG) deployed to Kuwait, replacing the headquarters of the 38th Infantry Division (Indiana ARNG). The 30th Armored BCT (North Carolina and West Virginia ARNG) replaced the 3d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, in November 2019. In September 2020, the 30th Armored BCT passed its  role  as  the  theater's  armored  BCT  to  the  2d  BCT,  1st  Armored Division.  The  Army  maintained  an  aviation  brigade  in  Kuwait  to support theater-wide operations. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 34th Infantry Division (Minnesota ARNG), replaced the 244th Aviation Brigade, an expeditionary combat aviation brigade from the USAR, in  January  2020.  In  addition  to  these  forces,  Army  logistics  and transportation units also served in Central Command areas.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, South

U.S.  Army,  South,  canceled  or  postponed  most  regional  exercises planned for FY 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it continued staff talks, humanitarian relief operations, virtual training, and  limited  exercises  with  partner  nations.  The  missions  of  Joint

Task Force Bravo ,  stationed at Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras, and its primary unit, the 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, include helicopter  support  to  counter  organized  crime,  medical  readiness training, and disaster relief support. In May, Joint Task Force Bravo conducted a large formation helicopter exercise out of Soto Cano Air Base.  This  training  exercise  allowed  participants  to  test  capabilities essential  for  operating  in  an  emergency.  It  also  facilitated  a  threeweek online basic aeromedical-evacuation training course for twenty members of the Honduran Air Force.

In  January,  soldiers  from  the  82d  Airborne  Division's  2d  BCT and Division Artillery joined personnel from U.S. Army, South, on a static-line parachuting exercise near Tolemaida Air Base, Colombia. Over the next several days, participants conducted tactical exercises that simulated securing an airfield and working with their Colombian counterparts. In June, the 1st SFAB deployed a company-sized advisory team to Colombia. The team worked with Colombian security forces in  regions  designated  by  the  host  government  as  priority  areas  and focused on logistics, services, and intelligence capabilities in support of U.S.-Colombian  counternarcotics  collaboration.  In  September,  U.S. Army, South, conducted the eleventh U.S.-Colombia Bilateral Army Staff Talks virtually because of COVID-19. The 525th Military Police Battalion  and  rotational  military  police  units  from  the  ARNG  and USAR supported Joint Task Force guantanamo .

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Africa

During FY 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoD canceled  or  postponed  many  of  the  planned  regional  exercises  in Africa  involving  Army  forces.  The Flintlock exercise,  a  special operations  exercise  focused  on  the  Sahel  region,  took  place  in Mauritania  and  Senegal  with  regional  and  NATO  (North  Atlantic Treaty  Organization)  partners  in  February.  U.S.  Army,  Africa,  had planned to lead the aFrican lion exercise,  a  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staffsponsored  exercise,  beginning  on  23  March  2020.  The  exercise  was supposed to occur in Morocco, involve roughly 3,800 U.S. troops and 5,000 troops from a dozen other countries, and foster interoperability among partner nations to counter transnational threats. However, on 16 March U.S. Africa Command canceled the exercise because of the pandemic.  Soldiers  did  participate  in  several  regional  summits  and medical readiness exercises during FY 2020. Army units also served tours as the Combined Joint Task Forcehorn oF aFrica and its East Africa Response Force (EARF), based at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti.

During  FY  2020,  threats  to  U.S.  and  partner  nation  forces  in East  Africa  remained  high  and  Army  forces  participated  in  several operations in the region. On 30 September 2019, Al-Shabab fighters attacked  the  Baledogle  Airfield  in  Somalia,  which  housed  several hundred U.S. troops. On 5 January 2020, Al-Shabab militants attacked and briefly gained entry to a small U.S. base near Manda Bay, Kenya. The militants killed one soldier and two American civilian contractors, and also damaged several aircraft. As part of the American response to the attack, 120 soldiers from the 3d BCT, 101st Airborne Division, serving with the EARF, deployed to Manda Bay. To allow the 101st Airborne  Division  to  focus  on  preparing  for  large-scale  combat operations, in February 2020 the Army announced that the 1st SFAB would replace the 101st Airborne Division troops at Manda Bay. The 1st  SFAB  soldiers  would  focus  on  training,  advising,  and  assisting regional partners. The Army would fill the EARF mission with other Army forces assigned to the region.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Pacific

The Army maintained some 85,000 troops permanently stationed in the Indo-Pacific region during FY 2020, of whom 21,000 were located in the Republic of Korea. These forces, along with additional soldiers from the continental United States, participated in a number of exercises in the region despite disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S.  Army,  Pacific,  continued  its  Pacific  Pathways  program  to enhance readiness and build relationships with partner militaries, albeit in an abrogated form because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Launched in 2014, Pacific Pathways combines multiple preexisting exercises with partner  nations  into  integrated  operations.  The  Army  revised  the program in 2019 to send troops to fewer countries for longer periods.

Soldiers  from  the  25th  Infantry  Division  traveled  to  Thailand in  late  February  2020  to  participate  in  the  first  phase  of  Pacific Pathways.  They  were  scheduled  to  participate  in  the hanuman guardian and coBra gold exercises,  which  began  in  Thailand  on 24 and 25 February respectively, before moving on to other exercises in the region. coBra gold ,  an annual joint exercise conducted with allies and partners from across the Indo-Pacific region, concluded in

Thailand as scheduled on 6 March without incident. The Royal Thai Army, host of the annual army-to-army exercise hanuman guardian , had  scheduled  the  exercise  to  last  until  late  May.  U.S.  Army  and Thai Army soldiers adopted a number of measures to help prevent or mitigate a COVID-19 outbreak. On 1 April, U.S. Army, Pacific, ordered the soldiers participating in hanuman guardian to return to Hawai'i. They returned in several groups from 13 to 19 April. Medical personnel screened the soldiers for COVID-19 before they departed Thailand. Upon their arrival in Hawai'i, the soldiers then entered a mandatory quarantine period. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command canceled other regional exercises planned as part of Pacific Pathways, such as Exercise Balikatan in the Philippines, because of COVID-19.

Other regional exercises included a short-notice airborne operation by  the  Alaska-based  4th  BCT,  25th  Infantry  Division.  On  1  July 2020,  350  paratroopers  jumped  on  Guam  as  part  of  an  emergency deployment readiness exercise. In August, sixty members of the 5th SFAB conducted  the  unit's  first  overseas  mission  with  a  thirty-day training mission in Thailand.

In September, Army units also participated in deFender-paciFic 2020  exercises.  The  intent  of  this  joint  exercise  was  to  demonstrate strategic  readiness  by  deploying  combat  credible  forces  across  the Indo-Pacific theater of operations. Army units practiced capturing and reinforcing islands by air and sea during two exercises. In one exercise, paratroopers  from  the  25th  Infantry  Division  simulated  seizing an island with a jump in the Alaskan interior, while U.S. Air Force C-17s flew M142 High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers of the 5th Battalion, 3d Field Artillery Regiment, from Fort Lewis to Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island in the Aleutians. Meanwhile, 2d Infantry Division soldiers flew from Y okota Air Base in Japan to an airstrip in Palau. The next day, an Army logistics support vessel arrived in Palau from Guam with HIMARS from the 17th Field Artillery Brigade.

In 2004, the U.S. and South Korean governments agreed to move all U.S. forces to garrisons south of the Han River. The United States will relocate most of these forces to Camp Humphreys, about 60 kilometers south of Seoul on the west coast of the peninsula. During FY 2020, the relocation effort remained in its final stages as work continued to return the installations associated with U.S. Army Garrison Y ongsanCasey in the heart  of  Seoul  to  the  South  Korean  government.  The United States and Korea also canceled many military exercises during the year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The  armored  BCT  rotation  program  begun  in  2015  for  South Korea  continued.  The  2d  BCT,  1st  Infantry  Division,  arrived  from

Fort Riley, Kansas, to begin its nine-month rotation in March 2020. It replaced the 3d BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, which returned to Fort Hood. The Army also continued to maintain a rotational field artillery battalion equipped with the Multiple Launch Rocket System and an aviation battalion in South Korea during FY 2020. In March 2020, the 3d Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment was replaced by the 2d  Battalion,  4th  Field  Artillery  Regiment.  The  4th  Squadron,  6th Cavalry Regiment, concluded its rotation in October 2019 when the 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment replaced it. The 7th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment concluded its rotation in July 2020 when the 2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, replaced it.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Europe

U.S.  Army,  Europe's  Operation atlantic  resolve continues  to demonstrate  U.S.  commitment  to  collective  security  in Europe. It reassures  NATO  allies  and  partners  of  America's  dedication to  enduring  peace  and  stability  in  the  region.  As  part  of atlantic resolve , the Army continued to deploy U.S.-based forces to Europe for nine-month rotations during FY 2020. These rotations allow units to build readiness and increase interoperability with allied and partner militaries through multinational training events, such as the comBined resolve series of exercises. Approximately 6,000 soldiers participate in atlantic resolve at  any  given  time,  conducting  operations  and exercises across seventeen countries.

The U.S. Army had also planned to conduct in early 2020 the largest deployment from the United States to Europe in more than twentyfive  years.  This  exercise, deFender-europe 2020,  would have sent a division-sized force of 20,000 soldiers and 20,000 pieces of equipment. Upon  arrival,  it  would  have  drawn  an  additional  13,000  pieces  of equipment from pre-positioned stocks and then spread out across the continent to participate in various exercises with allies and partners. The first equipment from the United States arrived at Bremerhaven, Germany, on 20 February, and the first convoys of troops belonging to the 2d BCT, 3d Infantry Division, crossed into Poland eight days later, marking the official start of deFender-europe 2020.

By early March 2020, however, Army leaders had to decide on how to proceed with deFender-europe 2020 amid increasingly worsening conditions in Europe from the COVID-19 pandemic. They decided to halt the movement of all personnel and equipment to Europe on 13 March. Instead, the Army modified the size and scope of the exercise. Some of the approximately 6,000 soldiers and their equipment who

M1 Abrams tanks prepared for deployment to defender-europe 2020, February 2020.



had already arrived in Europe remained to conduct modified exercises, and  the  remainder  returned  to  the  United  States.  Nevertheless,  the exercise still achieved many of its objectives. The Army exercised its ability to coordinate large-scale movements of soldiers and equipment with  allies  and  partners.  The  decision  to  modify deFender also demonstrated the flexibility and adaptability of the Army in response to evolving circumstances.

From 5 to 20 June, U.S. Army, Europe, began the first phase of a modified deFender-europe exercise using  various  COVID-19 mitigation methods. Some 4,000 American soldiers who had remained in  Europe,  primarily  from  the  2d  BCT,  3d  Infantry  Division, joined  2,000  Polish  soldiers  to  conduct  exercise allied  spirit at the  Drawsko  Pomorskie  Training  Area  in  Poland.  Among  other objectives,  the  exercise  featured  a  Polish  airborne  operation  and  a U.S.-Polish division-sized river crossing. The Army later conducted a short-notice emergency deployment readiness exercise as part of the second phase of the modified deFender-europe exercise. On 14 July, 550 soldiers from the 2d Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, of the 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, deployed from Fort Hood to the Drawsko Pomorskie Training Area. This exercise demonstrated the Army's ability

to  rapidly  alert  and  deploy  an  armored  force  even  in  a  COVID-19compromised environment.

In addition to units permanently stationed in Europe, such as the 2d Cavalry Regiment and the 173d Airborne BCT, regionally aligned and rotational units also supported U.S. Army, Europe's missions. The headquarters of the 1st Infantry Division provided a mission command element  to  oversee  the  rotational  units  and  provide  a  division-level command and control capability until  June  2020.  At  that  time,  the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Division assumed this mission. The Army also continued rotating an armored BCT to Europe. The 1st BCT, 1st Infantry Division, completed its rotation in October 2019 and handed off responsibility to the 2d BCT, 1st Cavalry Regiment. In July 2020, the 2d BCT, 3d Infantry Division, took over.

The rotation of an armored battalion on long-term deployments to  Pabrade  Training  Area  in  Lithuania  began  in  FY  2020.  The  1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, was the first unit to complete this deployment as part of a larger brigade rotation to Europe of the 2d BCT, 1st Cavalry Division. Later in the year, the 2d Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment, part of the 2d BCT, 3d Infantry Division's rotation to Europe, deployed to Lithuania to continue this mission.

The Army continued to deploy forces to Battle Group Poland, one of NATO's four enhanced forward-presence units. The intent of these multinational battle groups, established in April 2017, is to reinforce NATO's eastern front, deter future Russian incursions, and work with host-nation defense forces. In January 2020, the 3d Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, a Germany-based unit equipped with the Stryker armored fighting  vehicle,  replaced  the  3d  Squadron,  278th  Armored  Cavalry Regiment (Pennsylvania and Tennessee ARNG). In July 2020, the 2d Cavalry Regiment's 2d Squadron replaced it in Battle Group Poland.

Since FY 2017, the Army has deployed a reinforced combat aviation brigade from the United States for a nine-month rotation in Europe to supplement the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade. In November 2019, the  Combat  Aviation  Brigade,  1st  Infantry  Division,  handed  over responsibility to the Combat Aviation Brigade, 3d Infantry Division. The 101st Airborne Division's combat aviation brigade arrived in July 2020 to assume this mission.

## Domestic Operations

In  late  March  2020,  three  RA  hospital  units  moved  to  the  regions most affected by the pandemic. The 627th Hospital Center deployed from Fort Carson to Seattle, Washington. The 9th Hospital Center from Fort Hood, and the 531st Hospital Center from Fort Campbell,

deployed to New York City. These units established field hospitals to supplement the capacity of civilian hospitals. Later, the Army switched to  embedding  its  medical  personnel  directly  into  civilian  hospitals  to augment their staff. A total of 13,000 soldiers from five hospital units deployed during FY 2020 to support civilian hospitals across the country.

The  DoD,  in  response  to  a  request  from  the  Department  of Homeland  Security  in  September  2019,  authorized  the  continued deployment of up to 5,500 military personnel to the southwest border through the end of FY 2020. A force of approximately 5,000 troops remained deployed, split between RA and ARNG personnel. These forces,  under  the  control  of  U.S.  Northern  Command and assisting Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP),  constructed  fencing  and temporary  barriers,  conducted  surveillance,  and  provided  logistical support. They were not directly involved with civilian law enforcement activities. Some 160 soldiers from the RA's 687th Engineer Company and  519th  Military  Police  Battalion  formed  crisis  response  teams to  assist  CBP  at  the  points  of  entry  in  San  Ysidro,  California,  and El  Paso,  Texas.  In  April  2020,  the  DoD  authorized  an  additional 540  military  personnel  to  assist  CBP  agents  in  handling  migrants who might have COVID-19. Military personnel also helped operate CBP-owned surveillance equipment at the border. In June, the DoD extended  the  military's  border  mission  through  30  September  2021 after the Department of Homeland Security requested its continued support.  The  Army  capped  this  new  force  at  4,000  troops  and  it consisted mostly of ARNG personnel.

The killing of George P . Floyd Jr. by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 25 May 2020 sparked protests against police violence at numerous locations around the nation. On 30 May 2020, the DoD alerted RA military police units at Fort Drum, Fort Bragg, Fort Carson, and Fort Riley for possible deployment to Minneapolis, but these units did not deploy to the city. On 2 June, the DoD deployed 1,300 RA troops from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum to military installations just outside of Washington, D.C., in case civilian law enforcement in the city requested their assistance. The troops from Fort Bragg consisted of  the  2d  Battalion,  504th  Infantry  Regiment,  and  a  headquarters element from the 16th Military Police Brigade. The Fort Drum soldiers came from the 91st Military Police Battalion. Also alerted for possible use in the city was the 3d Infantry Regiment, located at Fort Myer, Virginia. The troops from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum began returning to their home stations on 4 June.

On 3 June, the secretary of the Army, the chief of staff, Army, and the sergeant major of the Army published a message to the Army about  the  civil  unrest.  They  emphasized  the  importance  of  taking

care  of  people  and  treating  every  person  with  dignity  and  respect, and that racial division erodes trust among soldiers and between the Army and the American people. The message reminded soldiers and civilian employees that they swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and that includes the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. They urged Army leaders of all ranks to listen to their people and to  ask  the  uncomfortable  questions,  to  lead  with  compassion  and humility, and to create an environment in which people feel comfortable expressing grievances.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Structure

During  FY  2020,  the  ARNG  comprised  roughly  39  percent  of  the Army's overall operational force. Structurally, the ARNG has thirteen command and control headquarters: eight divisional, two expeditionary sustainment,  and  one  each  for  military  police,  theater  sustainment, and air and missile defense. It also has two Special Forces groups, one SFAB, twenty-seven BCTs, forty-two multifunctional support brigades, and fifty-five functional support brigades and groups.

The  ARNG Directorate,  located  in  Arlington,  Virginia,  reports to the National Guard Bureau. It develops and administers ARNG policies  and  programs. The directorate consists of the Office of the Director, ARNG, and the ARNG Readiness Center, which is a fieldoperating agency of the National Guard Bureau. Additionally, staff from the Office of the Chief, National Guard Bureau, provides support to the ARNG Directorate in areas such as public affairs, legislative liaison, and contracting.

The USAR is organized under a single general officer with staff responsibilities to the Department of the Army as the chief of USAR and command authority over most USAR soldiers as the commander, U.S. Army  Reserve  Command  (USARC).  Approximately  2,000 units are organized into twenty-two functional commands and seven geographic  commands-three  mission  support  commands  and  four readiness  divisions-all  overseen  by  USARC.  The  USAR  provides nearly 20 percent of the total Army's organized units; more than a quarter of its mobilization base expansion capacity; and half of its maneuver support and sustainment formations, including civil affairs, medical, fuel distribution, logistics, and transportation units.

In  July  2020,  the  director  of  the  ARNG  announced  plans  to rebuild  the  ability  to  deploy  entire  divisions  for  large-scale  combat operations.  To  do  so,  the  Army  will  realign  some  units  under  the Guard's eight divisional headquarters to provide each division with all  the  capabilities  they  need  to  deploy  and fight as a division. This reorganization will provide the Army with eight additional fully staffed divisions  and  enable  ARNG  division  personnel  to  train  together,

thereby increasing each division's readiness to fight as a unit. Although the divisions will contain units from multiple states in the same region and the reorganization will therefore require the cooperation of state officials,  the  changes  will  not  alter  current  force  structure  or  affect the  authorities  of  state  governors  and  adjutants  general.  The  new approach will enhance the promotion potential of soldiers, who will be able to serve at higher echelons of their division even if these are based in different states. The ARNG anticipates that all eight divisions will reach their initial operating capability by October 2021.

In March 2020, the Army officially recognized the ARNG's newly established 54th SFAB in a ceremony at Fort Bragg. The 54th SFAB headquarters is part of the Indiana ARNG, and its six battalions are based  in  Florida,  Georgia,  Illinois,  Ohio,  and  Texas.  In  September 2020, the South Carolina ARNG's 117th Engineer Brigade received federal recognition as the Army's newest engineer brigade. The brigade will  serve  as  a  headquarters  unit  for  command  and  control  of  all ARNG engineer assets in South Carolina.

During  FY  2020,  the USAR  resumed  the  divestment  and inactivation  of  its  watercraft  capability.  In  June  2018,  the  secretary of  the  Army  directed  the  reduction  of  the  service's  watercraft  fleet from 134 boats spread among the active and reserve components to 62 boats concentrated in the active component. Designed to free up funds for other projects, the decision included a cut to all funding for USAR watercraft, and USARC began to divest its fleet. In mid-2019, the acting secretary of the Army halted implementation of the fleet's restructuring  until  after  additional  study  of  the  military  watercraft needs and capabilities. The acting secretary in September 2019 approved a plan to retain seventy-four watercraft as the study continued. With that decision, USARC recommenced its divestment actions. USARC has scheduled all vessel transfers and unit inactivations to be completed by the end of FY 2021.

In  October  2019,  the  USARC's  Civil  Affairs  and  Psychological Operations  Command  (Airborne)  and  the  Smithsonian  Cultural Rescue Initiative  signed  an  agreement  to  train  and  support  soldiers whose mission is to ensure that cultural property is not destroyed or damaged during armed conflict. The new initiative makes official what had previously been an ad hoc effort. In recent years, the Smithsonian has led occasional workshops to train military personnel in cultural preservation, and the command has sought cultural specialists since 2015. The Smithsonian will train volunteers who enter the new Army Monument  Officers  Training  program.  They  will  become  military government specialists, an area of concentration under the civil affairs career branch that is available only to USAR officers who have relevant

knowledge, skills, and expertise. Cultural heritage preservation officers will  advise  the  Army  regarding  geographic  areas  where  military operations may threaten cultural sites and objects and will assist local authorities  in  preserving  their  own  cultural  treasures.  The  officers' expertise will  also  enable  them  to  support  noncombat deployments, such as earthquake response operations.

## Mobilizations

The  USAR  mobilized  16,260  soldiers  from  981  units  in  FY  2020 ( Table 12 ).

The operational tempo of the ARNG increased markedly during the fiscal year due in large part to domestic demands resulting from the  COVID-19 pandemic and widespread civil  unrest.  The  ARNG executed most of these missions with soldiers in state active duty status or  under  Title  32  mobilization  status,  under  which  state  governors retain control of their troops.

From January through June 2020, the  ARNG recorded just over 5 million full-days' equivalence in the service of domestic missions, more than twice the total for all of calendar year 2019. On 6 June 2020, when national domestic unrest was at a highpoint, more than 72,600 ARNG soldiers were on orders responding to civil disturbances or supporting the nation's COVID-19 response.

During FY 2020, 19,872 ARNG soldiers mobilized under Title 10 of the U.S. Code for federal active duty service ( Table 13 ).

## COVID-19 Pandemic Operations

During the second half of FY 2020, a major focus of the ARNG was the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  scope  of  the  crisis  compelled  state governments to task thousands of ARNG soldiers with a broad range of missions. The ARNG's activities began in earnest in early February 2020,  shortly  after  the  federal  government  confirmed  the  first  U.S. COVID-19 case on 22 January. It then began actively planning and preparing for a possible response effort. Troop mobilizations started soon  after.  Washington  State  became  an  early  hotspot,  and  on  7 March the state called up four ARNG soldiers to assist with emergency planning. Over the next several weeks, the number of soldiers assisting U.S. civil authorities grew rapidly. By 1 April, all fifty states, three U.S.

territories,  and  the  District  of  Columbia  had  collectively  mobilized 15,208 ARNG soldiers to assist with pandemic response efforts. By 1 May, this figure had grown to 37,954, and midway through the month the total reached 39,463. The number of troops supporting COVID19 response efforts gradually declined during the summer and stood at 22,456 on 1 August. At the end of the fiscal year, 15,571 ARNG troops still  assisted  civil  authorities  with  this  mission.  Only  New  Jersey  no longer had soldiers mobilized for this purpose.

The  unique  conditions  of  the  pandemic  prompted  the  Trump administration to modify the funding process for ARNG mobilizations. Typically, when governors call up ARNG troops for disaster response missions, they serve in state active duty status. Initially, this was true of soldiers activated to respond to the pandemic. However, the pandemic's adverse effects on states' economic health made state leaders reluctant to respond aggressively with ARNG deployments because of concerns about  the  costs  of  funding  ARNG  troop  activity.  To  address  these concerns,  in  late  March  the  president  began  authorizing  activation of state and territorial National Guard personnel on Title 32 orders. Under Title 32 orders, governors continue to control ARNG forces but the federal government pays for most expenses, including federal pay and benefits for soldiers. The president directed the secretary of defense  to  request  that  governors  order  National  Guard  troops  to execute mission assignments issued to the DoD by FEMA.

That same month, the DoD also altered its process to authorize the use of National Guard forces under Title 32 Section 502 (f). The change created a conditional preauthorization in response to FEMA requests, which ensured swifter federal funding for forces mobilizing to aid COVID-19 response efforts. An authorization was subject to several conditions. States and territories, or FEMA, had to identify specific requirements for COVID-19 support; states and territories had to submit their requests to FEMA; and FEMA would then provide the DoD with a fully reimbursable mission assignment. The department indicated  it  would  immediately  approve  requests  that  met  these conditions  and  identified  FEMA 's  National  Response  Coordination Center as the single point of entry for all assistance requests. FEMA required that Title 32 requests from states and territories meet several criteria  before  it  considered  them  for  approval.  First,  FEMA  must have approved a major disaster declaration for the state or territory, or the state or territory must have submitted a major disaster declaration request for review. Second, the state or territory must have activated the lesser  of  either  500  individuals  or  2  percent  of  National  Guard personnel  in  response  to  COVID-19.  Third,  a  specific  request  for reimbursement  had  to  be  submitted  to  the  FEMA  administrator,

identifying the particular emergency support functions to be carried out. If approved under those criteria, the federal government would reimburse states and territories for pay and allowances of National Guard personnel fulfilling  a  FEMA  mission  assignment.  Normally, states and territories would pay 25 percent of the cost of activations under Title 32 and the federal government 75 percent; however, the president  waived  the  25  percent  contribution  until  22  August.  For seven states, this relief continued through the end of the fiscal year.

Some  states  and  the  territory  of  Guam  employed  dual-status commanders  from  the  National  Guard  to  coordinate  their  pandemic response  efforts.  Usually  a  general  officer,  a  dual-status  commander manages complex missions involving National Guard members in state active  duty  or  Title  32  status  and  other  service  members  in  Title  10 status, such as medical and construction personnel. The commander is simultaneously a member of both the state chain of command, subject to the orders of the governor and adjutant general, and the federal chain of  command, subject  to  the  orders  of  the  president  and  secretary  of defense. The arrangement ensures unity of effort and enhances efficiency.

ARNG personnel undertook a variety of missions. In some states, soldiers helped staff emergency operations centers or worked in call centers where they answered questions about the virus. Throughout the  country,  ARNG  troops  provided  urgently  needed  assistance with  COVID-19  testing,  sometimes  setting  up  large  drive-through operations that served hundreds of people a day. Concerns as to whether local  hospitals  would  have  enough  beds  for  all  possible  COVID-19 cases  led  some  areas  to  expand  capacity  by  building  alternate  care facilities in empty hotels, dormitories, or arenas, and ARNG troops assisted with setup and medical care. In New York City, soldiers from the New York ARNG helped establish a hospital in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where a joint and multicomponent staff ultimately treated  approximately  1,100  COVID-19  patients  during  one  month of  operation.  Other  ARNG  soldiers  transported  medical  supplies and,  in  some  instances,  trained  first  responders,  health  personnel, and retailers in the use and decontamination of personal protective equipment. Troops cleaned and sanitized  nursing  homes,  where  the elderly  were  particularly  susceptible  to  infection.  In  Massachusetts, ARNG personnel with medical skills helped to provide care at nursing homes. Florida and Puerto Rico ARNG soldiers screened passengers for COVID-19 symptoms as they arrived at local airports.

The economic effects of the pandemic generated other missions for  ARNG  soldiers.  As  businesses  downsized  or  closed  because  of official lockdowns or in response to the spread of the virus, many more Americans experienced food insecurity. To help meet the unusually high

demand for assistance at a time when the pandemic was reducing the number of volunteers at local food banks and other aid organizations, ARNG troops stepped in  to  pack  and  distribute  food  and  provide meals. In Ohio, for instance, ARNG soldiers assisted fourteen food bank locations and warehouses, a mission they had started in midMarch  and  continued  as  the  fiscal  year  ended.  ARNG  personnel also  supported  expanded  state  administrative  operations.  In  New Hampshire, soldiers staffed an unemployment call center. In Oregon, they aided the state employment department with the processing of a record number of unemployment insurance claims.

The primary thrust of the USAR effort involved the call-up of medical professionals to staff the new UAMTFs. During FY 2020, the USAR sent UAMTFs to hard-hit areas in a number of states. By the end of the fiscal year, the USAR had deployed twenty UAMTFs to help combat the pandemic.

For example, more than 300 members of  the  377th  Sustainment  Command  assembled  in  New  Orleans  to provide planning, communication, and logistics support to FEMA as it  moved essential medical supplies around the country. In addition, as the Corps of Engineers rapidly constructed alternate care facilities throughout  the  United  States,  members  of  the  416th  Engineer Command's  Contingency  Response  Unit  deployed  to  Washington, D.C., to augment the operations center at the Corps' headquarters.

The USAR's two fixed-wing aircraft battalions performed critical roles in moving senior leaders, soldiers, medical response personnel, and medical supplies around the country at a time when commercial air  transportation  was  limited  and  potential  exposure  to  the  virus otherwise  may  have  required  personnel  to  quarantine  upon  arrival. In  April,  for  example,  Company  B,  2d  Battalion,  228th  Aviation Regiment, and Company A, 6th Battalion, 52d Aviation Regiment, delivered seven Army critical care nurses and medical gear to Seattle,

Washington.  As  demand  for  military  aircraft  increased,  USARC's G-3/5/7  Aviation  Directorate  stood  up  a  mission  command  node called the 'Double Eagle Express' to better manage and accommodate the  many  competing  priorities.  During  April  and  May,  the  air operations center coordinated about seventy-five requests. In August and September, it dealt with more than 220. These missions included standard military air transport for more than 1,100 essential personnel and support for multiple resourcing and planning conferences.

Outside  of  the  continental  United  States,  personnel  from  the USAR's 9th Mission Support Command headquartered in Honolulu, Hawai'i, deployed to Guam, American Samoa, Saipan, and around the state to support medical efforts. In Honduras, members of the 352d Combat Support Hospital screened personnel entering Soto Cano Air Base and assisted with the evacuation of U.S. citizens in the region.

## Civil Unrest

In late May 2020, civil unrest throughout the United States prompted states to call up thousands of ARNG troops. Protests in Minneapolis after  the  death  of  George  Floyd,  along  with  looting  and  arson,  led the governor of Minnesota on 28 May to activate nearly 400 ARNG soldiers to maintain order. By 2 June, he had called up almost 7,000 troops. As protests spread to more states, other governors took similar steps. As of 6 June 2020, 41,398 ARNG soldiers in 32 states and the District of Columbia were on orders to help state and local authorities deal with civil disturbances.

In  Washington,  D.C.,  the  president  controls  the  District  of Columbia National Guard via a chain of command that runs through the DoD. Demonstrations in the city after the death of George Floyd led  to  looting,  fires,  and  confrontations  near  the  White  House.  The Trump administration then ordered the District of Columbia National Guard to active duty in support of law enforcement agencies in the city. On the evening of 1 June, soldiers supporting federal law enforcement helped forcibly clear protesters from Lafayette Square in front of the White House just before the president emerged to pose for photographs near the fire-damaged St. John's Episcopal Church across the square.

Later that evening, two D.C. ARNG medical evacuation helicopters hovered low over protesters in the city, kicking up debris and causing alarm.  On  3  June,  the  D.C.  National  Guard's  commanding  general ordered  an  investigation  of  this  incident  under  Army  Regulation 15-6.  The  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  in  HQDA  reviewed  the investigation's  report  and  notified  the  DoD  Inspector  General  of  a

District of Columbia ARNG soldiers from the 273d Military Police Company, 30 May 2020



possible emergent allegation against a senior D.C. Army ARNG officer. The DoD Inspector General in July 2020 identified several items that needed clarification and additional information before it could reach a conclusion regarding the investigation results. It requested the Office of The Inspector General to conduct additional investigative work to provide the necessary information. That work was ongoing at the end of the fiscal year.

The Trump administration also requested National Guard troops from  other  states  deploy  to  Washington,  D.C.,  to  protect  national memorials  and  otherwise  assist  local  and  federal  law  enforcement officers dealing with the crowds assembled in the city. As of 6 June, some 3,900 soldiers from eleven states had joined more than 750 D.C. ARNG troops in Washington. By then, tensions were dissipating and the violence had ebbed. Within days, all out-of-state ARNG soldiers returned home.

As the end of the fiscal year approached, a flare-up of civil unrest again led to the activation of several thousand ARNG soldiers. On 23  August,  violent  protests  erupted  in  Kenosha,  Wisconsin,  after police  shot  Jacob  Blake  Jr.  Demonstrations  continued  during  the

days that followed, and protesters clashed with counterprotesters. In response, the governor of Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help with crowd control, infrastructure protection, and security for emergency services personnel. By 28 August, the state had called up more  than  500  Wisconsin  ARNG  soldiers.  As  of  29  August,  some 2,000  ARNG  troops  were  on  orders  in  the  state,  including  more than 700 members of military police units from Alabama, Arizona, and Michigan. After protests  spread  to  other  areas  of  the  country, the governor of Massachusetts also briefly activated several hundred ARNG troops  for  possible  support  to  the  Boston  police.  By  midSeptember, state governments had demobilized all of the troops.

Events in Kentucky prompted the activation of ARNG forces in late  September.  On  23  September,  protests  broke  out  after  officials released  the  results  of  a  grand  jury  investigation  into  the  death  of Breonna  Taylor,  killed  by  Louisville  police  officers  in  March  2020. Angered  that  the  grand  jury  did  not  indict  any  police  officers  on criminal charges directly related to Taylor's death, demonstrators in Louisville  and  communities  around  the  United  States  took  to  the streets once more. In Kentucky, the governor called up ARNG soldiers to assist the Louisville police and protect critical infrastructure in and around the city. By 27 September, the state had activated nearly 1,300 soldiers. It demobilized them within days as the situation calmed. In several other states, ARNG troops were on standby for several days, ready to support local police if needed.

## Readiness

Reserve component efforts to improve readiness and reduce deployment timelines continued during FY 2020. In keeping with the Army's changing strategic concerns, the USAR in 2016 began shifting its  orientation  from  predictable,  rotational,  and  episodic  readiness and  employment  to  large-scale  and  short-notice  combat  operations against peer or near-peer threats. In FY 2020, the USAR continued a program started in 2016, Ready Force X, designed to boost readiness in select units and enable the USAR to surge capability faster. Rather than  building  readiness  for  scheduled  overseas  rotations  with  long mobilization  lead  times,  as  the  USAR  did  for  operations  in  Iraq and Afghanistan, Ready Force X has been building a pool of units with high-demand capabilities that are able to deploy quickly. In all, Ready Force X affects about a third of the force. Examples of highdemand capabilities include transportation, cyber, aviation, medical, engineers,  and  military  police.  USAR  leadership  has  stressed  also

that the foundation of unit readiness is individual readiness in terms of physical fitness, medical readiness, tactical discipline, professional education, and field craft proficiency.

COVID-19  travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and distancing rules impeded training during the fiscal year. In mid-March 2020, the USAR paused battle assemblies and other training until the nation reduced infections. By June, USAR leadership recognized that the pandemic was likely to persist for some time and would prevent soldiers from participating in Combat Support Training Exercises as well as the prerequisite training for these exercises. Concerns about the concomitant degradation of readiness led to new guidance. The USAR directed units to use the remainder of FY 2020 to conduct readiness training at the individual and squad level, including qualification on individual and crew-served weapons. In FY 2021, training will move primarily  to  the  squad  and  platoon  level,  with  the  expectation  that large-scale collective training will resume in FY 2022.

Modified  small-scale  collective training officially resumed  in July 2020. A decision to allow soldiers to perform up to twenty-four days of drill as distance learning aided this development. Many units had already pursued this course and developed training solutions in advance of the new guidance. Methods for a virtual battle assembly varied, but generally included slide presentations, online exercises, time for physical training, and other adapted activities. Some USAR units used the virtual format as an opportunity to test virtual coordination that would be required in mission situations. As the year progressed and situations permitted, some units adopted hybrid battle assemblies. These allowed soldiers from the commuting area to appear in person with  proper  protection  and  distancing,  whereas  those  from  farther away continued to participate virtually. To a large degree, the USAR's recent emphasis on the development of virtual training options made possible the rapid introduction of virtual assemblies and training.

In  August,  Operation ready Warrior initiated  the  resumption of  some  collective  training  opportunities.  The  USAR  designed  the operation to deliver in-person training at the individual and squad level while providing extensive health screening, adequate distancing, and public health protection. Sessions included new weapon qualifications, an introduction to the new ACFT, and other specialty-specific training. The weeklong first session, held at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, trained more than 1,000 soldiers. The USAR held a subsequent session at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, in September.

The ARNG's 4.0 initiative seeks to reduce the amount of training that Guard units need upon mobilization. The program will increase readiness  over  time  through  organizational  and  cultural  changes,

thereby  strengthening  the  ARNG.  It  will  develop  units  that  are sustainably staffed, equipped, and trained to deploy quickly for multiple contingencies rather than preparing for a specific mission. ARNG 4.0 employs a multiyear training cycle that requires high-demand units, such as armored and Stryker BCTs and attack-reconnaissance aviation battalions, to conduct as many as sixty-three training days or more per year, rather than the standard thirty-nine, culminating in a combat training center rotation.

During the second half of the fiscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced  the  ARNG's  emphasis  on  its  4.0  initiative.  Thousands  of soldiers assisted local pandemic response efforts, units postponed or canceled training at home and overseas, and health precautions pushed other training  online.  The  ARNG  scheduled  approximately  4,000  troops from the Idaho ARNG's 116th Cavalry BCT to deploy to Europe for a month in late April to participate in Exercise deFender-europe 2020, but in mid-March HQDA canceled the unit's deployment. It likewise canceled  the  Washington  ARNG's 81st Armored BCT's rotation at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin in May. So, too, were the scheduled  summer  rotations  of  the  Florida  ARNG's  53d  Infantry BCT and the Virginia ARNG's 116th BCT, 29th Infantry Division, at  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center.  Health  protection  concerns, requirements  for  ARNG  assistance  at  home,  and,  for  some  units, an  inability  to  prepare  sufficiently  for  their  rotation  because  of  the pandemic, influenced these decisions. In July, after the Army resumed higher-echelon collective training, the Minnesota ARNG's 1st BCT, 34th Infantry Division, conducted the first rotation at the National Training Center with new health protection measures in place.

## Disaster Relief Operations

On 7 January 2020, a series of earthquakes struck the southern coast of Puerto Rico, beginning with a predawn temblor that registered 6.4 on the Richter scale. It caused heavy damage, injuries, and one fatality. The governor activated the Puerto Rico National Guard, and by 15 January,  more  than  1,000  ARNG  troops  provided  support  to  local civil  authorities.  Among other tasks, soldiers supplied medical care, distributed water, and prepared and served hot meals to individuals displaced  from  their  homes.  The  USAR's  1st  Mission  Support Command based at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, also activated 299 soldiers, including personnel from the 430th Quartermaster Company and the 268th Transportation Company, who furnished laundry and

shower  services.  Several  soldiers  from  the  76th  USAR  Operational Response Command and USAR Legal Command mobilized as well.

During the summer, ARNG forces helped civil authorities respond to several hurricanes.  After  Hurricane  Isaias  hit  eastern  North Carolina as a Category 1 storm on 3 August, North Carolina ARNG soldiers assisted state and local emergency management officials with rescue and recovery efforts, including using their high-water vehicles to transport rescue workers and gear. Virginia ARNG soldiers helped clear trees and debris from roads in the storm's aftermath.

On 27 August 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana,  as  a  destructive  Category  4  storm.  In  advance  of  the hurricane, Louisiana's governor activated nearly 900 ARNG troops, and then added to their numbers until almost 2,800 had been mobilized by  28  August.  After  the  storm,  soldiers  cleared  roads  and  bridges; helped  evacuate  people  and  pets;  and  distributed  tarps,  water,  and military rations.  Texas  likewise  mobilized  more  than  400  personnel, and Arkansas contributed additional troops. In total, more than 4,000 ARNG soldiers helped state and local officials prepare for and respond to the storm. On 16 September 2020, Hurricane Sally made landfall as a Category 2 storm near Gulf Shores, Alabama. Western Florida nevertheless  bore  the  brunt  of  the  slow-moving  storm,  suffering torrential  rains  and  related  flooding.  By  20  September,  Florida  had activated  more  than  400  ARNG  troops  for  assistance  with  search and rescue efforts, debris clearance, and supply distribution to storm victims. A smaller contingent of Alabama ARNG troops helped with high-water  evacuations,  traffic  control,  supply  distribution,  and power  restoration  efforts  in  their  state.  Although  the  Mississippi ARNG had staged soldiers and equipment for a possible response in advance of the hurricane, it did not need them as the storm made landfall to the east.

Throughout the fiscal year, ARNG personnel assisted state and local authorities fighting wildfires. The Kansas ARNG, for instance, supplied two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and crews to help battle the state's wildland fires in the fall and spring. They dropped water in areas firefighters on the ground had difficulty accessing. The western United  States,  however,  faced  the  most  challenging  conditions.  In October and November 2019, hundreds of California ARNG troops helped the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection battle wildfires. The summer and fall of 2020 brought additional fires that burned more than 2 million acres of land in California, leading the governor to call up hundreds of soldiers again to support the state's firefighters.  During  August  and  September,  California  also  received assistance  from  small  contingents  of  ARNG  troops-particularly

UH-60  Black  Hawk  flight teams with their helicopters-from Arizona, Idaho, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. As of mid-September 2020, approximately 1,500 ARNG personnel were supporting  firefighting  efforts  in  the  state.  Soldiers  dropped  water from buckets attached to helicopters, provided hand crew and medical evacuation  support,  and  assisted  with  perimeter  mapping,  damage assessment,  spot-fire detection, and  traffic control. In addition, California  ARNG engineers assembled a 100-foot improved ribbon bridge across the Cache Creek to create a faster access route to a nearby fire. In Oregon, hundreds of the state's ARNG troops likewise battled unusually severe wildfires, sometimes supported by ARNG personnel from other states. Governors in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Washington also ordered elements of their states' ARNG to active duty because of wildfires during the summer and fall of 2020.

In  mid-September  2020,  more  than  2,500  ARNG  personnel  were assisting with firefighting efforts. Late in the fiscal year, seven soldiers from the California ARNG's Combat Aviation Brigade, 40th Infantry Division-the crews of a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and a CH-47 Chinook helicopter-earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for their efforts during a California wildfire. On 5 and 6 September, they made multiple trips in dangerous flying conditions to rescue 242 people and their pets trapped by a fast-moving fire in the Sierra Nevada.

Throughout much of the year, elements of the USAR's 2d Battalion, 135th Aviation Regiment (General Support), provided aviation fire response support to the Yakima Training Center in Washington.  From  May  through  September,  two  CH-47F  aircraft  and necessary crews remained stationed and prepared to provide aerial fire suppression capabilities.

ARNG  troops  also  took  part  in  smaller  state  disaster  relief missions.  In  November  2019,  members  of  the  New  York  ARNG assisted  with  debris  clearance  and  traffic  control  after  heavy  rains and winds damaged roads and flooded towns in upstate New York. In  December, more than 200 of the state's ARNG soldiers assisted with snow removal operations, primarily clearing snow from around fire hydrants, after a winter storm deposited as much as 2 feet of snow in some areas of the state. During April and May 2020, the New York ARNG also helped to control flooding near Lake Ontario when water levels rose to 4 feet higher than average.

In Oregon, three helicopter crews from the ARNG provided search and rescue support during February flooding, ultimately rescuing fiftyfour people and a dozen pets, and in May, Michigan ARNG personnel helped evacuate residents threatened by flooding caused by the breach of  two  dams.  After  a  tornado  struck  central  Tennessee  in  March, more than sixty ARNG soldiers distributed relief items, assisted law enforcement with traffic control, conducted damage assessment and recovery operations with helicopters, and performed other missions. Louisiana ARNG personnel similarly assisted civil authorities after April  tornadoes  in  northeast  Louisiana,  using  heavy  equipment to  move  debris  and  operating  a  debris  collection  site.  In  Iowa,  an August derecho windstorm caused extensive damage and led to the mobilization of 150 ARNG troops. The soldiers performed damage assessments and assisted in removing debris from roadways and power lines, enabling civilian electrical crews to restore power to thousands of Iowans.

In some instances, these disaster relief operations temporarily pulled soldiers  away  from  COVID-19-related  missions.  The  pandemic  also created unique operating conditions. Concerns about the spread of the

virus required Guard units to deploy with health safety procedures and protective equipment to operate safely. This sometimes led to special measures, such as the additional activation of mobile-testing teams.

## Specialized Missions

During  FY  2020,  the  ARNG  continued  to  deploy  troops  to  the southwest border of the United States in support of CBP . The secretary of defense originally authorized the mobilization of ARNG personnel for  this  mission  during  FY  2018.  As  of  30  September  2020,  nearly 2,100 soldiers served along the Mexican border in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

The second half of the fiscal year brought a range of activities and events associated with the 2020 presidential election that required support from the ARNG. In June, the governor of Oklahoma activated some 250 ARNG troops to assist with crowd control and help staff checkpoints outside a rally in Tulsa held by President Trump, and in September,  the  governor  of  Ohio  activated  more  than  300  ARNG personnel to support the Cleveland police force during a presidential debate  at  Case  Western  Reserve  University.  In  Colorado,  North Carolina,  Pennsylvania,  West  Virginia,  and  Washington,  ARNG cyber  specialists  provided  cybersecurity  support  to  state  officials  to help  safeguard  elections.  In  Kentucky,  New  Jersey,  and  Wisconsin, soldiers assisted at polling places during their state primaries. Dressed in civilian clothes, they cleaned, assisted with traffic control, counted ballots,  and  performed  other  tasks  normally  handled  by  civilian workers  who  in  2020  stayed  home  because  they  were  in  high-risk categories for COVID-19.

## State Partnership Program

During  FY  2020,  the  ARNG  continued  to  strengthen  its  ties  with military forces around  the  world.  The  National  Guard  Bureau administers  the  State  Partnership  Program,  which  pairs  U.S.  states and territories with other countries. The U.S. State Department guides the program by its foreign policy goals, and each state or territory's ARNG implements  the  program.  The  partnerships  enable  ARNG personnel and units to build long-term relationships with the armed forces  of  other  nations  by  conducting  regular  military-to-military and  interagency  activities  and  participating  in  various  exercises.  In FY 2020, Guard personnel and their partner nations conducted field

exercises and carried out subject matter expert exchanges on topics such as disaster response operations and medical readiness. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of certain planned events, but some units compensated with virtual engagements or made the pandemic itself a focal point of their exchanges. In late spring 2020, for example, the Alabama ARNG hosted a delegation of Romanian military and civilian  medical  and  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear specialists who visited long-term care facilities and hospitals, discussing medical emergency and COVID-19 response strategies, best practices, and standard operating procedures with ARNG units. At the end of the fiscal year, the program included eighty-two partnerships involving one-third  of  the  world's  countries,  covering  all  six  U.S.  geographic combatant commands.



## Management

The acquisition data domain (ADD) will collect and link data from a program's inception as an idea through its development, production, fielding,  sustainment,  and  demilitarization.  The  larger  domain  will then interlink  these  subdomains so that leaders can understand the impacts  of  accelerating  or  divesting  capabilities  that  the  Army  is developing. The ADD will permit the use of advanced analytical tools such as artificial intelligence or machine learning. A pilot program for the business management portion of ADD began in FY 2018. To save time and funds, the pilot built on the Air Force's Project Management Resource Tools (PRMT). In FY 2020, program executive offices began the transition to PRMT. The Army expects that the transition will be completed by the first quarter of FY 2021.

In March 2019, the Office of Management and Budget directed  federal  executive  branch  agencies  to  implement  category management. Category management is the business practice of buying common goods and services using an enterprise approach to reduce redundancies,  increase  efficiencies,  and  drive  savings  in  government acquisition programs. In February 2020, the deputy under secretary of the Army published the policy for common category management contract solutions and practices, and for aligning contracting activities to categories.

## The Army Modernization Strategy

The  Army  published The  Army  Modernization  Strategy in  October 2019 to support implementation of The Army Strategy .  It  expanded on  the  Army's  2018  report  to  Congress  on  modernization  strategy, which described the service's six modernization priorities: long-range precision  fires;  next-generation  combat  vehicles;  future  vertical  lift; network;  air  and  missile  defense;  and  soldier  lethality. The  Army Modernization  Strategy described  how  the  service  would  retain  its position  as  the  globally  dominant  land  power  while  transforming

The Army Modernization Strategy Framework



itself into a modernized Army-capable of multidomain operations as part of an integrated joint force in a single theater and conducting multidomain  operations  across  an  array  of  scenarios  in  multiple theaters-by 2028 and 2035, respectively. To do this, the Army will modernize  how  it  fights,  what  it  fights  with,  and  who  it  is  as  an institution. Taken together, this approach will integrate the elements of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leader development and education, personnel, facilities, and policy.

## Initiatives

In  November 2019, the secretary of defense designated the secretary of the Army as the DoD executive agent for counter-small unmanned aircraft systems (C-sUAS). In turn, the secretary of the Army established the Joint Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office. This office will lead, synchronize, and direct C-sUAS activities to facilitate unity of effort across the DoD. It expects to publish a C-sUAS strategy for the DoD early in FY 2021. During FY 2020, the office completed an assessment  of  currently  fielded  C-sUAS  capabilities.  This  assessment determined the selection of existing systems for future investment based on criteria such as effectiveness, usability, sustainment, and integration. Additionally, the secretary of the Army directed the Rapid Capabilities

and Critical Technologies Office to serve as the materiel and acquisition lead for the Joint Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office.

AFC completed a strategic fires study in FY 2020 that identified a capability gap in Army forces' ability to attack targets in the midrange, defined as between 500 and 2,000 kilometers. Targets in this range fall between the Precision Strike Missile and the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon. The secretary of the Army in July 2020 directed that the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office deliver a prototype weapon system with midrange fires capabilities by FY 2023. The weapon will be  able  to  engage  moving  targets  on  land  and  at  sea.  The  prototype will consist of launchers, missiles, and a battery operations center. To meet the FY 2023 delivery date, the prototype will utilize and modify existing  hardware  and  software  from  the  Army  and  joint  service partners and integrate additional technologies to achieve the required operational effects.

## Logistics and the COVID-19 Pandemic

In  response  to  the  pandemic,  ASA  (ALT)  established  a  COVID-19 task  force.  The  task  force  helped  to  coordinate  the  procurement  of materiel needed by the Army during the pandemic: 75 million items of  personal  protective  equipment;  over  300  diagnostic  instruments; over 3 million COVID-19 tests, sample collection kits, and ancillary material; and nearly 180 thermal imaging devices in support of fever screening. The ASA (ALT) aggressively implemented policy updates to leverage use of Other Transaction Authority for these acquisitions to  rapidly  procure  supplies  and  streamline  all  documentation  for expedited approval and execution.

The  ASA  (ALT)'s  Joint  Program  Executive  Office-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and  Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) provided  DoD  acquisition  support  for  Operation  Warp  Speed,  the partnership between the federal government and private organizations established in May 2020 to develop and deliver vaccines for COVID19. Partnering with Army Contracting Command and the Department of  Health  and  Human  Services'  Biomedical  Advanced  Research and  Development  Authority  (BARDA),  JPEO-CBRND  managed 173  COVID-related  contract  actions  and  awarded  over  $11  billion to accelerate vaccine development  and  delivery. JPEO-CBRND facilitated  contract  awards  for  five  vaccines,  two  therapeutics,  and eleven enablers such as vials and needles in coordination with Operation Warp Speed. Additionally, to support interagency efforts to increase testing capability and capacity, the JPEO-CBRND leveraged existing

contracts  with  industry  partners  to  procure  three  mobile  medical laboratories. It used one of these laboratories to conduct nearly 4,000 COVID-19 tests at Camp Riley, a Minnesota ARNG training facility. It  delivered  a  second  laboratory  to  the  Army  Public  Health  Center to support COVID-19 testing. JPEO-CBRND worked with industry partners and BARDA to develop and procure rapid COVID-19 tests in response to a shortage of testing materials at six DoD training sites.

The Logistics Civil Augmentation Program uses civilian contractors to augment the logistical capabilities of Army operational forces. The HQDA G-4 facilitated the approval and use of the program for other organizations during the pandemic. Among these were Operation Warp Speed, the Navy's Recruit Training Command for recruit quarantine, and the Army Corps of Engineers to assist in the establishment of hospital-capable expansion facilities.

The  Expeditionary  Technology  Search  is  a  program  sponsored by the ASA (ALT) designed to attract small businesses working on transformative  technology  solutions  that  the  service  can  apply  to help  solve  the  Army's  challenges.  In  FY  2020,  the  program  held  a COVID-19 Ventilator Challenge. A panel of subject matter experts evaluated  the  submitted  solutions  based  on  mission  requirements, technical viability, regulatory burden, and speed of delivery for 10,000 units. Within thirty days of the Army issuing the challenge, it awarded contracts to two companies.

The Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center designed a Combat Cloth Face Covering (CCFC) that uses the same Operational Camouflage Pattern used on Army field uniforms. At  the  start  of  the  pandemic,  the  Army  provided  disposable  or reusable solid color masks to soldiers or permitted them to use neck gaiters and other cloth items, such as bandanas and scarves, as face coverings. The Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center produced more than 12,000 prototypes for operational testing by  soldiers  training  at  the  Maneuver  Center  of  Excellence,  Fort Benning. After the testing, the Army Uniform Board recommended, and the chief of staff, Army, approved issuing two CCFCs to recruits at the start of their basic combat training course starting in the second quarter of FY 2021. The Army expects the CCFCs to be available for purchase at AAFES uniform stores in FY 2021.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

In FY 2019, the secretary of the Army directed the accelerated delivery of a prototype ground-launched hypersonic weapon. In March 2020, the  Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office and

Combat Cloth Face Covering prototype testing at Fort Benning, Georgia



the  Navy's  Strategic  Systems  Programs  Office  jointly  conducted  a successful  flight  test  of  the  Common-Hypersonic  Glide  Body  (CHGB) from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Hawai'i. The C-HGBwhen  fully  fielded-will  comprise  the  weapon's  warhead,  guidance system, cabling, and thermal protection shield. The Navy and Army are working closely with industry to develop the C-HGB with the Navy as the lead designer and Army as the production lead. Each service will use the C-HGB while developing individual weapon systems and launchers tailored for their needs.

In  December  2019,  the  Army  awarded  a  four-year  production agreement  for  Army  Vantage.  Begun  in  FY  2019  as  the  Army Leader  Dashboard,  it  is  an  enterprise  operations,  analytics,  and data  management  platform  that  will  enable  Army  users  at  every echelon and across classification levels to make data-driven decisions. The cloud hosts the platform and it operates  on  the  Non-classified Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  and  the  Secret  Internet  Protocol Router  Network.  Army  Vantage  will  provide  users  with  near  realtime visibility and access to more than 135 Army source systems and enterprise resource planning systems.

Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense is a system that integrates sensors, weapons, and a common mission command interface across an integrated fire control network. The Army conducted a limited user test of the system from July to September 2020. The test consisted of five  phases: software and hardware in-the-loop sustained operations against simulated threats; sustained operations against live air targets; two missile flight tests; march order and emplacement; and adversarial assessment.  Preliminary  indications  show  improved  reliability  and stability from the previous test in 2016. The Army expects to make the Milestone C decision on the system in November 2020.

The M1A2 Abrams tank's System Enhancement Package version 2 (SEPv2) upgrades include increased memory and processor speeds, full  color  tactical  display,  digital  map  capability,  and  compatibility with the Army Technical Architecture. In June 2020, DoD's director, operational test and evaluation, published a report summarizing the performance of the Abrams SEPv2 with the Trophy Active Protection System installed during tests in FY 2019. The report supported the Army's decision for Urgent Material Release of SEPv2 vehicles to four brigades in Europe and the Pacific. The M1A2 Abrams tank's System Enhancement Package version 3 (SEPv3) rectifies many of the space, weight, and power issues identified during Operation iraqi Freedom and will be the foundation for all future incremental upgrades to the Abrams. In the first quarter of FY 2020, the Army completed live-fire testing of the Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 and began fielding it to units in the last quarter of the fiscal year. The Army plans to conduct a test and evaluation program for Abrams SEPv3 with the Trophy Active Protection System from the second to fourth quarters of FY 2021.

The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is the replacement for the M113 family of vehicles in armored BCTs. The contractor did not meet the July 2020 first vehicle delivery dates for the AMPV . By the end of the fiscal year, the contractor was six to eight months behind the original schedule to deliver vehicles for use in initial operational testing  and  evaluation  and  live-fire  testing.  In  FY  2020,  the  Army continued live-fire testing using prototype vehicles across all AMPV variants to support the evaluation of survivability and force protection specification requirements. The Army will make a decision on when to proceed to initial operational testing and evaluation in the first quarter of FY 2021, and has scheduled a full-rate production decision for the third quarter of FY 2022.

The Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) is a lightweight troop carrier for infantry BCTs.  The  Army  Test  and  Evaluation  Command conducted  developmental  testing  of  three  vendors'  prototype  ISVs from  December  2019  to  January  2020.  The  Army  then  conducted

the Soldier Touchpoint 2 assessment of the prototypes at Fort Bragg in  January.  (Soldier  Touchpoints  allow  contractors  to  test  system prototypes  with  soldiers  throughout  the  research  and  development process to ensure the final product incorporates soldiers' assessments before they field it to units.) In June, the Program Executive Office, Combat Support and Combat Service Support, selected one of the prototypes  to  enter  Milestone  C  low-rate  initial  production.  The Army Test and Evaluation Command will conduct the ISV's initial operational testing and evaluation in August 2021. The Army plans to field ISVs to 11 Infantry BCTs for a total of 649 vehicles by FY 2025.

The Initial Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (IM-SHORAD) Vehicle  is  a  system  of  systems.  It  consists  of  Stinger  and  Longbow Hellfire missiles, a 30-mm. cannon, a machine gun, an electro-optical sight  system,  and  a  multihemispheric  radar  mounted  on  a  Stryker Double-V hull. The system is part of the Army's efforts to rebuild its short-range air defense capabilities. The Army started live-fire testing and evaluation of IM-SHORAD in February 2020. The survivability and lethality testing is expected to be complete in the first quarter of

FY 2021. In September 2020, the chief of staff, Army, decided to acquire 32 vehicles before operational testing. The Army plans for an expeditionary operational assessment after fielding for FY 2022 in Germany.

The Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) is a series of trucks, configured to support a variety of cargo hauling methods, based on a common chassis that varies by payload and mission. The FMTV A2 is a set of hardware and software improvements to the FMTV A1 trucks designed to expand their capabilities. The FMTV A2 Wrecker and Load Handling System variants demonstrated poor reliability and degraded vehicle functionality in developmental testing. In FY 2020, the program developed a test and evaluation master plan to outline the production verification test and the follow-on operational testing and evaluation for the FMTV A2 vehicles. The Army Test and Evaluation Command  plans  to  conduct  the  follow-on  operational  testing  and evaluation in FY 2022.

The Army delayed the fielding of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) to  several  Army  units  during  FY  2020  from  three  to  seven months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the Army canceled  a  JLTV  developmental  test  with  soldiers  because  of  the pandemic. The test was to have soldiers assess the command, control,

and  communication  capability  of  the  Mounted  Family  of  Computer Systems  (MFoCS)  integrated  on  the  JLTV .  The  Army  will  assess  the MFoCS during the August 2021 JLTV developmental/operational testing.

The  Integrated  Visual  Augmentation  System  (IVAS)  is  a  lowprofile,  ruggedized,  heads-up  display  with  a  body-borne  computer pack, conformal wearable battery, squad radio, and integrated sensors. In  the  first  quarter  of  FY  2020,  the  Army  conducted  the  Soldier Touchpoint 2 to assess  the  IV AS  Capability  Set  2  prototypes  in  an operational  environment.  These  prototypes  demonstrated  increased capability  from  Capability  Set  1,  including  the  ability  to  integrate the  Global  Positioning  System,  tactical  radios,  and  rapid  target acquisition. The prototypes also fused low-light and thermal imagery and  simultaneously  operated  up  to  fifty  systems  within  squad  and platoon  exercises.  The  assessment  identified  performance  problems with the Global Positioning System, imagery sensors, and rapid target acquisition  integration.  Because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the Army delayed the Soldier Touchpoint 3 for the system from July to October 2020. The IVAS Capability Set 4 will be the production-ready

device;  the  Army  expects  to  receive  1,600  of  these  systems  in  April 2021 to support the initial operational test.

The Enhanced Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B) is a helmetmounted individual night vision device with dual thermal and infrared sensing capabilities. It operates on the Intra-Soldier Wireless network with Nett Warrior allowing soldiers to receive and display navigational, targeting, and situational graphics. The Army equipped the 2nd BCT, 1st  Infantry  Division,  with  the  ENVG-B  in  September  2019  before the BCT's deployment to South Korea in FY 2020. During FY 2020, Program Executive Office Soldier conducted a reliability growth test of the ENVG-B at Fort Polk using soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division. Reliability growth tests are part of an iterative test-fix-test cycle in which soldiers use the equipment to help expose weaknesses in a system's software or hardware. By the end of FY 2020, the ENVG-B had entered low-rate initial production.

## Foreign Military Sales

The Army Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is part of the overall U.S. Defense Security Assistance program. It oversees sales of ground forces equipment, training, supplies, and services to foreign countries. The  FMS  program  is  a  significant  element  of  U.S.  foreign  policy and  helps  strengthen  bilateral  defense  relationships  and  improve interoperability between U.S. forces and foreign partners.

During  FY  2020,  Australia  bought  Javelin  missiles  and  related equipment  for  $46  million  and  155-mm.  cannon  ammunition  and accessories,  and  related  equipment,  for  $132.2  million.  Jordan  was approved  to  purchase  up  to  700  Advanced  Field  Artillery  Tactical Data  System  software  license  copies  and  related  equipment  for an  estimated  cost  of  $300  million.

## Installations

The  G-9,  as the proponent  for Strategic Readiness Tenet #6 (Installations), developed a new metrics-based framework to evaluate  the  strategic  readiness  of  installations.  This  framework, also implemented in FY 2020, provides an assessment of installation readiness  across  all  Army  components  and  incorporates  input,  risk assessments, and resource requirements from land holding commands and installation enterprise experts. The assessment found installation readiness at risk in FY 2020, with projected risk anticipated to increase through F 2024 because of reduced sustainment funding, personnel shortages  in  key  service  areas,  and  increased  facility  requirements affecting installations. The G-9 found that 24 percent of Army facilities were  in  poor  or  failing  condition,  requiring  additional  funding  for renovation. Additional funding is required to mitigate risk and reduce increased future demand for funding to replace facilities that are no longer economical to repair.

The Army continued to enhance efficient water and energy use at Army installations. The assistant secretary of the Army (installations, energy,  and  environment)  (ASA  (IEE))  produced  an  Installation Energy and Water Resilience Assessment Guide to assist installations in  developing  or  improving  energy  and  water  systems.  It  includes guidance  for  conducting  black  start  exercises  to  test  backup  power generation  at  installations  and  a  directive  establishing  requirements for installations to protect critical assets against climate change and extreme weather. The Office of Energy Initiatives worked on thirtytwo projects at twenty-four installations, with an aim to make eighteen installations  capable  of  operating  independently  in  the  event  of  a power grid outage. The office's programs also aimed to increase the use of renewable energy at Army installations by developing a variety of technologies including battery storage, solar power, and microgrids.

The ASA (IEE) reviewed the Army's annual facility  investment strategy to spend $1.9 billion in major repair projects of critical facilities and facilities supporting soldiers' and Army families' quality of life at various installations. To improve and update cost comparisons of

options for closing or reorganizing installations, the Army established a Configuration Control Board and tested a Cost Comparison Analysis Tool for Stationing. The HQDA G-9 refined the Army's plans to invest in multiple information technology systems for installations worldwide and led efforts to improve installation management accounting across all Army financial systems.

Installation  management  staff  implemented  several  personnel management  and  professional  development  initiatives  in  FY  2020. The Army continues to offer incentives to retain and attract childcare providers, including military spouses, at its installations. Army leaders selected  ten  installation  management  personnel  to  participate  in the  City-County  Management  Senior  Fellowship  Program.  These personnel will work with city or county managers to gain management skills  for  operating  communities  such  as  military  installations.  The program will continue in FY 2021 after delays caused by the COVID19 pandemic. The new Tenet Assessment Working Group reviewed, measured, and analyzed operations, capabilities, and risks related to managing Army installations.

## Housing, Construction, and Infrastructure

The Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) is the Army's partnership with private companies to build and maintain almost all on-post family housing. During FY 2019, widespread publicity about the failure of these companies to provide required maintenance and repair services, and their frequent disregarding of tenant complaints about these failures, prompted an inspection of the RCI by the Office of The Inspector General. Similar failures in the privatized housing programs of the other services led Congress to include in the FY 2020 National  Defense  Authorization  Act  eighteen  rights  of  military service members and their families residing in privatized housing on military installations.

In February 2020, the secretary of defense and the secretaries of the military departments signed a Military Housing Privatization Initiative Tenant Bill of Rights. By the end of FY 2020, the DoD implemented fourteen of the eighteen rights in the bill. The four remaining rights were a process for dispute resolution, a method for withholding Basic Allowance for Housing payments during a dispute, a way for tenants to obtain a housing unit's maintenance history, and standard forms and documents for privatized housing projects.

The Army hired a contractor to review the operations and finances of privatized housing projects. These reviews are the corrective action in  response to a finding in The Inspector General's 2019 inspection

of  the  RCI  program.  It  recommended  that  the  Army  conduct  an operational and financial audit (to include historical records) of each project and establish a system to validate portions of RCI program financial statements and operating expenses. The contractor reviewed seven projects in FY 2020. It will perform an additional seven reviews every fiscal year thereafter until it has reviewed all RCI projects. Also in FY 2020, the Army secured $1.6 billion in additional funds from bankers  and  private  investors  to  construct  3,800  new  homes  and renovate 18,000 houses on Army installations over the next five years.

Because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, companies delayed some routine maintenance projects of RCI housing. Companies also delayed  several  planned  renovations  and  demolitions  of  privatized Army housing. Using guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention,  companies  had  adjusted  maintenance  practices  by the  end  of  FY  2020  and  were  reducing  the  backlog  and  beginning construction efforts.

In September 2020, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, an  independent  federal  agency  that  promotes  historic  preservation, adopted  the Program  Comment  for  Department  of  the  Army  InterWar Era Historic Housing, Associated Buildings and Structures,  and Landscape Features (1919-1940) . A program comment is an alternate method for federal agencies to meet their obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires them to consider the effects of projects they carry out, approve, or fund for historic  properties.  The  program  comment  ensures  the  preservation of  the  historic  and  architectural  character  of  the  housing  with  its agreed-upon standardized criteria, procedures, and design guidelines. At the same time, it will permit the Army to more effectively address hazardous materials in them, such as lead-based paint and asbestos; the high maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation costs associated with historic  housing;  the  need  for  additional  bedrooms  and  expanded living space; and the modernization of heating, ventilation, plumbing, and electrical systems.

In FY 2020, the Army completed forty-four new buildings certified as  environmentally sustainable by the U.S. Green Building Council, including  five  in  Germany  and  Korea.  These  buildings  included aircraft hangars, barracks, clinics, schools, dining facilities, and unit headquarters.

In  March  2020,  the  secretary  of  defense  placed  strict  limits  on official  travel  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  reduction in travel significantly affected the Privatized Army Lodging program, as  the  spring  and  summer  are  its  busiest  times  of  the  year.  Facility operators  furloughed  many  of  their  employees  to  reduce  expenses.

Additionally, the service suspended all development to preserve cashon-hand until it could ascertain the financial impact of the pandemic. In FY 2020, occupancy was at 56.3 percent instead of the budgeted 72.2  percent  and  total  revenue  was  $219.9  million  instead  of  the expected $284.3 million.

The  Army  and  OSD  updated  the  European  Infrastructure Consolidation  Business  Plan  to  include  closing  or  consolidating thirty-five Army posts in Europe by FY 2025. The Army continued some infrastructure actions in Europe, renovating Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, and closing part of Camp Darby, Italy. The Army delayed other European Infrastructure Consolidation actions because of  uncertainty  about  President  Trump's  plans  for  decreasing  troop strength in Europe.

## Public Affairs

The Army Communication Plan for 2020 emphasized three themes: 'Ready Now'-the Army has highly trained, disciplined, and fit teams that can win on the battlefield; 'Investing in the Future'-the Army is modernizing to meet the challenges of the future; and 'People'-the Army's greatest strength.

The  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Public  Affairs  (OCPA)  released guidance on communicating about the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Army operations. In April, OCPA asked Army personnel to share official Army posts about the pandemic to combat the spread of  misinformation  online.  Public  affairs  personnel  stressed  that  the service protected the health of soldiers, civilian employees, and families by cancelling or scaling back events and exercises, limiting in-person recruiting, and imposing travel restrictions. OCPA stressed that Army chaplains remained available for virtual counseling of individuals. It shared crisis-line telephone numbers in the United States and abroad to  assist  members  of  the  Army  community  experiencing  stress  or anxiety related to the pandemic. Public affairs personnel also shared information on Army efforts to combat the pandemic.

In FY 2020, OCPA developed the Outreach Knowledge Management  System.  It  is  a  web-based  application  that  provides immediate access to planning documents, coordinates outreach, and engages Army leaders in communications efforts. OCPA also used the Sprinklr technology system to share content, collect data, and evaluate interactions on Army digital and social media platforms.

## Legislative Liaison

In  FY  2020,  the  Office  of  the  Chief,  Legislative  Liaison  (OCLL), worked to gain congressional support for Army initiatives including military housing reforms, sexual harassment and sexual assault policies, the  new  ACFT,  military  health  system  reforms,  and  modernization of the Army. Before COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, OCLL facilitated  visits  by  fifty-five  congressional  delegations  and  eightyeight congressional staff delegations to sites in the U.S. and abroad. It provided daily updates to Congress on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the Army and on Army support of pandemic response efforts. The pandemic did not permit hearings at traditional venues, so OCLL assisted  Army  senior  leaders  in  preparing  for  hybrid  congressional committee and subcommittee hearings. The office answered over 530 congressional  requests  for  information  regarding  COVID-19.  For all  of  FY 2020, OCLL answered over 10,000 written inquiries from members of Congress. Members of Congress took a close interest in Fort Hood after the murder of Spc. Vanessa Guillén. OCLL facilitated briefings  about  and  visits  to  Fort  Hood  by  several  congressional delegations,  including  trips  led  by  the  chair  of  the  House  Armed Services  Committee's  Subcommittee  for  Military  Personnel  and  the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

## Chaplain Corps

The  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Chaplains  (OCCH)  established  virtual meetings of senior Chaplain Corps leaders around the world to share ideas and practices for ensuring soldiers' exercise of religion during the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Chaplains  implemented  virtual  worship services  broadcast  over  the  Internet  and  safety  precautions  for  inperson gatherings. OCCH created a digital-giving platform that allowed Army religious communities to continue to support religious programs financially during the pandemic. It also provided $6.8 million in grants for Army garrisons to support virtual worship services by the purchase of  audiovisual  equipment,  computers,  software,  and  furniture.  The Chaplain Center and School implemented virtual Chaplain Candidate Practicum to replace traditional in-person training for reserve component chaplain candidates.

OCCH  worked  with  Columbia  and  Baylor  Universities  and Yale  Divinity  School  to  create  the  Science  of  Spirituality  Initiative, a  five-step  pilot  program  for  training  soldiers  to  maintain  spiritual fitness  as  part  of  their  holistic  health.  As  part  of  this  initiative,  the

Chaplain Corps worked with behavioral health specialists to develop assessments  of  soldiers'  mental  and  spiritual  health.  The  Religious Support  Division  of  OCCH  provided  $34.8  million  in  funding  for Strong Bonds, a chaplain-led program that trains soldiers and Army families to build and maintain good personal relationships. During the fiscal year, there were 743 Strong Bonds events with 30,347 participants in the RA, 175 ARNG events with 5,937 participants, and 13 events with 558 participants in the USAR.

Chaplain Corps recruiters attended the National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces in January 2020 to enhance relations with  religious  denominations  and  faith  groups  that  endorse  clergy. OCCH responded to COVID-19 restrictions by using online tools and social media for recruiting. Recruiters launched training sessions titled 'Every Chaplain Corps Member a Recruiter,' training 954 personnel to assist in recruiting chaplains to the Army. The Chaplain Corps met its FY 2020 recruiting targets despite the loss of twenty-one recruiters in December 2019. It selected the highest number of applicants in over a decade: 113 chaplains for the RA, 55 for the ARNG, and 112 for the USAR, and an additional 172 chaplain candidates for the ARNG and the USAR.

## Safety

The Army lost ninety-five soldiers and one civilian to accident-related fatalities in FY 2020, the fewest fatalities on record for a single year. The  U.S.  Army  Combat  Readiness  Center  (USACRC)  concluded that circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel restrictions, reduced the number of deaths. The Army lost seventy-one soldiers  to  off-duty  accidents;  fifty-three  of  these  fatalities  involved private motor vehicles.

There were 114 Class A accidents; these involve fatalities, permanent disabilities, $2 million or more of property damage, or loss of an Army aircraft. This was a 20 percent decrease in Class A accidents compared to  FY  2019.  Accidents  involving  government  motor  vehicles  killed eleven soldiers, including eight killed in six rollover accidents.

In FY 2020, there were six aviation accidents with crewed aircraft, causing  seven  fatalities,  and  nine  remotely  piloted  aerial  vehicle accidents. Despite only a small drop in flights because of COVID-19 restrictions, the Army reduced Class A crewed aviation accidents by 90 percent over FY 2019. In March 2020, the Army launched an aviation safety campaign emphasizing the importance of risk management and planning in aviation missions. USACRC set FY 2021 goals of reducing crewed aviation Class A accidents to a rate of 0.9 per 100,000 flying

hours, reducing Class A on-duty ground accidents by 5 percent, and reducing accidents involving Gray Eagle drones by 15 percent.

In conjunction with USACRC, the Office of the Director of Army Safety  reinvigorated  assessments  in  special  interest  areas  including ammunition, explosives, chemical agents, infectious agents and toxins, radioactive materials, and radiation generating devices. This program identifies trends and periodically informs senior Army leadership of shortcomings in these areas. The Office of the Director of Army Safety conducted special interest surveys at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, in  September  2019  and  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground,  Maryland,  in December 2019. Because of COVID-19 travel restrictions, it postponed the remainder of the surveys planned for FY 2020. Observations noted during the two surveys it conducted include problems with the number of explosives safety personnel and their qualifications and that aging facilities and  equipment  are  generating  maintenance,  repair,  and replacement funding challenges.

In FY 2020, USACRC launched the he Army Readiness Assessment Program  internet  tool  to  provide  battalion-level  commanders  with  survey data from soldiers and employees about their unit's or organization's safety  climate.  USACRC  released  the  Joint  Risk  Assessment  Tool database in October 2019 to assist with risk management by providing accident statistics. From June to September 2020, select Army units tested the Army Safety Management Information System 2.0. Based on  this  testing,  USACRC  made  improvements  to  it  and  expects  to release the system early in FY 2021.

Because  of  COVID-19  restrictions,  USACRC  adjusted  safety courses-suspending some, condensing others, and allowing blended learning options of face-to-face and virtual portions for some courses. In FY 2020, USACRC also shared general information on the COVID19 pandemic and directed that safety offices on individual Army posts investigate suspected cases of COVID-19 disease following guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

AAFES  operates  about  4,000  facilities,  including  department  and convenience  stores,  restaurants,  malls,  movie  theaters,  gas  stations, and  other  retail  businesses  on  military  installations  in  the  United States  and  thirty-two  other  countries.  All  AAFES earnings support military community programs including school services and recreation centers. AAFES employs 35,000 associates-85 percent of whom have connections to the military. Its workforce is 45 percent veterans and

military spouses or dependents. The sale of goods and services funds 97 percent of the AAFES operating budget, with 3 percent provided by federal appropriations to transport goods overseas.

In late 2019, AAFES offered tax-free shopping and discounts to all federal agencies and other organizations authorized to use government purchase cards in the continental United States. On 1 January 2020, in  accordance  with  the  Purple  Heart  and  Disabled  Veterans  Equal Access  Act  of  2018,  4.1  million  disabled  veterans,  Purple  Heart recipients, and their primary caregivers gained shopping privileges at Exchange facilities.

In early March 2020, AAFES adjusted its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. AAFES implemented disease prevention measures, requiring its employees to wear face masks. It installed acrylic shields at checkout counters, customer service areas, and restaurants, starting with facilities in Italy and expanding to other parts of Europe, the Pacific region, and the United States. AAFES regularly disinfected high-traffic areas, expanded restaurant delivery and takeout services, and delivered supplies to quarantined customers. In Korea, Japan, and Europe, AAFES distributed grab-and-go meals to students of DoD schools who were attending classes virtually because of the pandemic. In Iraq, Afghanistan, and other locations in the Central Command area  of  operations,  exchanges  offered  personal  shopping  services for  quarantined  service  members.  AAFES  deployed  Mobile  Field Exchanges to serve quarantined service members at Joint Base San Antonio, Fort Benning, and Fort Drum. A Mobile Field Exchange deployed to New York City served military personnel working at a temporary hospital set up in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. At AAFES clothing alteration shops, employees made face coverings for COVID-19 prevention. In spring 2020, with much of Europe under stay-at-home orders, AAFES's water plants in Grünstadt, Germany, and Vicenza, Italy, delivered bottled water to U.S. military homes and offices throughout Europe.

AAFES  provided  new  services  to  increase  morale  during  the pandemic. The senior enlisted adviser to AAFES hosted talks with celebrities and musical guests on the Exchange's Facebook page. Its Operation Fun campaign offered free movie screenings and familyfriendly virtual activities including crafts and giveaways.

AAFES  partnered  with  Installation  Management  Command (IMCOM) on three initiatives. In August 2020, AAFES and IMCOM launched  the  Digital  Garrison  technology  application  to  provide information  on  various  services,  such  as  shops,  child  development centers,  fitness  facilities,  and  recreation  programs  at  each  Army installation. At Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Fort Irwin; and Fort Polk,

the Quality of Life Task Force launched a pilot program to upgrade stores, dining facilities, and Wi-Fi infrastructure, and to offer jobs to military  spouses  at  remote  installations.  IMCOM  and  AAFES  are coordinating to ensure that AAFES continues to provide services to military communities in times of natural disaster or crisis.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The  Army's  Family  and  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR) program provides family, child, and youth programs and recreation, sports, entertainment, travel, and leisure activities to soldiers, Army families,  and  retirees.  It  runs  numerous  facilities  on  Army  posts including  libraries,  dining  facilities,  movie  theaters,  fitness  centers, swimming pools, bowling alleys, golf courses, childcare centers, and youth centers. MWR services include arts and crafts programs, travel programs,  outdoor  recreation  services,  concerts  and  entertainment, sports and  fitness programs,  tutoring and  educational  support, babysitter training, childcare fee assistance, automotive maintenance and training, financial services, relocation planning, and employment assistance.  MWR  runs  the  BOSS  (Better  Opportunities  for  Single Soldiers) program,  providing recreation and  community  service projects for single soldiers.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced MWR to curtail or modify its services  and  close  some  facilities  for  a  time.  Where  it  was  possible to  maintain  the  safety  of  children  and  staff,  the  Army  kept  child development centers open to continue providing affordable childcare. Centers  took  precautions  such  as  increased  cleaning  and  physical distancing.  Closed  centers  worked  with  Army  public  health  staff to  determine how and when to reopen. Army Community Services, which  provides  programs  to  promote  self-reliance,  resilience,  and stability,  continued  to  provide  financial  education  and  counseling, employment  programs,  relocation  assistance,  and  family  advocacy, offering virtual programs and website content to assist Army families. Military personnel were encouraged to use outdoor gyms. In July 2020, the BOSS program teamed with a gaming company to offer soldiers a twelve-week online e-sports tournament allowing individual soldiers the opportunity to participate safely from their barracks or homes.

Closures of MWR facilities and suspension of income-generating activities such as food operations, bowling alleys, and golf courses led to an inability to pay facilities' utility bills and MWR employee salaries. Proceeds from AAFES, which fund MWR activities, also dropped. To

cover lost revenues, the DoD provided $57.2 million in congressionally authorized COVID-19 emergency funding to Army MWR programs.

The MWR program hosted the 35th Army Ten-Miler road race on 13 October 2019 in Washington, D.C. More than 35,000 runners participated,  generating  proceeds  for  Army  MWR  programs.  On 1  January  2020,  as  authorized  by  the  Purple  Heart  and  Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018, MWR extended many services to 4.1 million disabled veterans, former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients,  and  their  primary  caregivers.  In  August,  the  secretary  of the Army approved allowing the ARNG to establish nonappropriated fund instrumentalities for MWR programs at Guard facilities and sites.

## Special Functions

## The Surgeon General

The Office of The Surgeon General is responsible for all health and medical matters of the Army, including the medical aspects of training, organizing and equipping the Army. The Surgeon General is also the commanding general of Army Medical Command (MEDCOM).

In  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Acts  of  2017  and  2019, Congress  directed  the  military  services  to  eliminate  what  it  saw  as duplicated services and establish a single, integrated military healthcare system by transferring control of medical treatment facilities (MTFs) to the DHA. In FY 2019, six Army MTFs in the eastern United States transferred  to  the  DHA.  On  2  April  2020,  the  deputy  secretary  of defense paused all transition activities because of the unprecedented burden  the  COVID-19  pandemic  was  placing  on  DHA  and  the services' medical organizations. This pause remained in effect through the end of FY 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a high demand for healthcare professionals. MEDCOM responded by creating the COVID Volunteer Retiree  Recall  program.  The  Army  issued  a  request  for  retirees possessing skills needed during the pandemic to return to active duty temporarily. By the end of FY 2020, 662 persons had volunteered and MEDCOM had selected 188 of them to serve at 31 MTFs and the 4 regional health commands. Another method used was the extension of officers with critical specialties beyond their mandatory retirement dates. Seven officers (three from the Medical Service Corps, two from the Medical Corps, one from the Army Nurse Corps, and one from the Medical Specialist Corps) opted to remain on active duty for an additional three years.

Army  health  facilities  implemented  a  number  of  measures  in response to the pandemic. They established COVID-19 testing sites and expanded inpatient treatment facilities. They installed new safety measures,  including  plexiglass  shielding  and  air  filtration  system improvements.  Virtual  health  treatment,  including  secure  online messaging  and  remote  video  consultations,  supplanted  much  of

the  usual  in-person  treatment,  particularly  during  spring  and  early summer  2020.  The  safety  measures  taken  at  facilities  increased  inperson treatment from August onward.

Medical Command prepared to handle large COVID-19 outbreaks on Army installations. Over the past twenty years, medical facilities on  some  posts,  including  initial  entry  training  centers,  had  been downgraded from hospitals to outpatient clinics.  These  posts  relied on nearby civilian facilities  to  treat  serious  cases.  Initial  projections of  the  disease's  possible  spread  generated  concern  that  these  posts would be overwhelmed by an outbreak at the same time as the civilian medical facilities they depended on. The RA, however, did not have a  surge  of  life-threatening  COVID-19  cases.  There  were  no  elderly persons,  the  most  at-risk  group,  serving  as  soldiers,  and  mitigation measures implemented on installations proved effective at curtailing transmission of the virus. The number of critical cases at installations remained  small,  so  no  medical  treatment  facility  experienced  the overload that affected hospitals in the New Y ork City area.

COVID-19 drive-through testing center, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, July 2020



The Health Facilities Planning Agency worked with the Corps of Engineers to create concepts of operation, programs for design, and equipment lists for alternate care sites in the United States. The agency assisted in 1,155 location assessments and the construction of 74 sites across  the  country.  In  coordination  with  the  MEDCOM  G-9  and the Corps of Engineers, the agency developed facility and equipment outfitting  contingency  plans  for  military  medical  facility  expansion capabilities. These plans included the Closed Hospital to Healthcare and Barracks to Healthcare models.

After a comprehensive review of the Warrior Care and Transition Program,  the  Army  in  November  2019  began  restructuring  it  to focus  on  complex  case  management  for  wounded,  ill,  and  injured soldiers. This restructuring will simplify and streamline policy, remove barriers,  and tailor services to fit the unique needs of every soldier. As part of that restructuring, in January 2020, the Army renamed the Warrior  Care  and  Transition  Program  to  the  Army  Recovery  Care Program.  It  reorganized  the  fourteen  Warrior  Transition  Battalions and  redesignated  them  as  Soldier  Recovery  Units.  Under  the  new organization, Soldier Recovery Units consist of platoons organized as 'tracks' to focus resources and services based on a soldier's point of recovery. The three primary platoons are complex care, veteran track, and return to duty. To incorporate the changes, the service published a revised Army Regulation 40-58 in May 2020. The Army expects the organizational restructure and reform measures to reach full capability by October 2020.

The Warrior Care and Transition Program had separate active and reserve component entry criteria. The Army Recovery Care Program established one unified set of entry criteria for all three components based on complex case management. The new criteria went into effect on 1 January 2020. Reserve component soldiers who do not meet the new entry criteria, but are entitled to remain on or return to active duty for medical evaluation or treatment, are eligible for a remote medical management program. Reserve component soldiers who entered the program  before  January  2020  will  retain  all  program  services  and continue to follow their comprehensive transition plan.

## Army Audit Agency

The  Army  Audit  Agency  provides  the  service  an  internal  auditing capability for all Army operations and programs. The Agency maintains an operations center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and the Pentagon, and sixteen field offices-thirteen in the continental United States and one

each  in  Germany,  Hawai'i,  and  South  Korea.  Because  of  previous efforts  to  ensure  employees  could  work  remotely,  the  transition  to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic did not hamper operations.

In  FY  2020,  the  agency  published  eighty-five  reports  with  over $229 million in potential monetary benefits. This represented a threeto-one return on investment for the audit process. Overall, the Agency made over 280 recommendations to improve Army operations. Topics examined  during  the  fiscal  year  included  objective  assessment  by units of their training status, the accuracy of information technology obligations  and  expenditures  recorded  within  the  training  program evaluation  group,  the  extent  of  compliance  with  acquisition  reform initiatives, and whether units were sustaining soldiers' proficiency in the Warrior Skill Level 1 tasks.

## Office of Army Cemeteries

During the fiscal year, the Office of Army Cemeteries (OAC) transferred nine  cemeteries  to  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs'  National Cemetery  Administration  because  these  sites  were  not  on  or  near active Army installations but were close to existing NCA cemeteries. At the end of FY 2020, OAC supervised thirty cemeteries in seventeen states and the District of Columbia.

OAC implemented several projects to improve visitor experience and sustainability at Arlington National Cemetery. These include the rebuilding of roads and storm water lines, cleaning and masonry repair of  the  Memorial  Amphitheater  and  the  restoration  of  its  exterior doors, as well as the construction of an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant access ramp. OAC planted over 100 new holly trees along  Memorial  Avenue  and  implemented  irrigation  systems  and turf renovations in other parts of the cemetery. Planning and design work continued  for  the  Southern  Expansion  to  Arlington  National Cemetery, with the goal of completing all design work by the end of FY 2021.

The  COVID-19 pandemic created a decrease  in  the  number  of burials at Arlington National Cemetery. In FY 2019, there had been 6,440 burials. In FY 2020, there were 4,817 burials. Families canceled 1,495 services at Arlington National Cemetery between 12 March and 30 September 2020. The cemetery rescheduled 708 of these services at the request of the families. OAC held seven interments at the Soldiers and  Airmen's  Home  National  Cemetery  in  Washington,  D.C.,  and three at the Tomb of Remembrance in Arlington National Cemetery.

Arlington National Cemetery Memorial Amphitheater



In  New  York,  land  reclamation  work  continued  at  the  West Point Cemetery to extend the longevity of the site. In Pennsylvania, the  Carlisle  Barracks  Disinterment  Program  continued  its  work  to exhume  the  remains  of  Native  American  children  that  died  at  the Carlisle Indian Industrial School during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and return them to their tribes. The OAC prepared the remains of eight children for return to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and one Aleut native to Saint Paul Island. However, the pandemic interfered with these plans and the program was postponed until FY 2021.

## Civil Works

In  February  2017,  President  Trump  issued  Executive  Order  13778, 'Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the 'Waters of the United States.'' This rule, in effect since 2015 and for which the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency are jointly responsible, defines the scope of waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. The Army and

Corps of Engineers contractors in Lake Charles, Louisiana, install reinforced plastic sheeting on a home damaged by Hurricane Laura.



the Environmental Protection Agency in February 2019 published the proposed revision of 'Navigable Waters Protection Rule: Definition of 'Waters of the United States.' The Federal Register published it as a final rule on 21 April 2020 and it went into effect on 22 June 2020.

In 2016, the Department of the Army issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the Water Supply Rule. It sought to clarify the Corps of Engineers' policies governing the use of its reservoir projects for domestic,  municipal,  and  industrial  water  supply.  The  clarification would define key terms under the Flood Control Act of 1944 and the Water Supply Act of 1958 to account for court decisions, legislative provisions,  and  other  developments  related  to  the  exercise  of  these authorities. In January 2020, President Trump directed the Corps of Engineers to withdraw its water supply rulemaking effort.

The Pebble Mine project in Alaska is in the Bristol Bay watershed. After its review of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project, the Corps of Engineers announced in August 2020 that the project as proposed would likely result in significant degradation of the  environment  and  adverse  effects  on  the  aquatic  ecosystem  and

human environment in the Bristol Bay watershed. Therefore, the Corps of Engineers found that it could not permit the project, as currently proposed, under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

The Corps of Engineers in March 2020 shut down all campgrounds it manages to protect against the spread of COVID-19. Other facilities, such as visitor centers and beaches, also closed. Day-use facilities and lake access areas such as boat launches, picnic areas, fishing piers, and viewing areas, remained open. In May, the Corps of Engineers began reopening its closed recreation areas. Reopening of closed areas varied by location based on state and local conditions, as well as each area's ability to put in place COVID-19 safety precautions

The Corps of Engineers responded to several hurricanes during FY 2020. One of the most important services was 'Operation Blue Roof.' This project has contractors install reinforced plastic sheeting on roofs damaged by hurricanes. Other missions included emergency power installation, supporting temporary housing facilities, conducting infrastructure assessments, and providing debris removal assistance to state governments.

## Environmental Protection

The  ASA  (IEE)  and  HQDA's  G-9  collaborated  to  develop  the Army Environmental Restoration Strategic Plan, published in April 2020.  It emphasized  management  strategies  that  gain  efficiency and  accountability,  provide  an  interrelated  vision  and  overarching objectives, and outline a unified strategy for environmental restoration. The plan provides the framework for implementing the Army's vision for environmental  restoration.  The  Army  signed  an  interagency agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support Army conservation  efforts,  expand  Army  partnerships  for  conservation, and  enhance  mission  support  and  stewardship  for  ecosystem  and endangered species recovery.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of human-made chemicals used in many applications worldwide since the 1950s, to include the firefighting foam used on military installations. In 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a lifetime health advisory for perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in drinking  water.  In  FY  2020,  the  Army  established  the  Army  PFAS Working  Group.  Subsequently,  a  joint  ASA  (IEE)/G-9  governance structure was created. The working group is the centralized, integrated policy and guidance directive body to address PFAS across the Army. It also will implement policy issued by the DoD's PFAS Task Force. In September 2020, the working group finalized a PFAS campaign plan.

## Chemical Weapons Demilitarization

The  chemical  weapons  demilitarization  program  eliminates  chemical warfare materiel in accordance with obligations specified in the Chemical Weapons Convention. The program destroyed nearly 90 percent of the U.S.  chemical  weapons  stockpile  in  2012,  and  then  dismantled  and closed  the  associated  chemical  weapons  destruction  facilities  over  a three-year period. The remaining stockpiles of this materiel are at Pueblo Chemical Depot, Colorado, and Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky. In May, Blue Grass Army Depot destroyed all 8-inch projectiles containing GB  nerve  agent  (sarin),  completing  the  first  munitions  destruction campaign of this class at this depot. Pueblo Chemical Depot in July completed construction of three static detonation chambers to augment its  destruction  capability.  In  September,  it  completed  destruction  of 155-mm.  projectiles  containing  mustard  agent  that  were  suitable  for processing in the depot's main plant. There are 286 155-mm. projectiles remaining that are unsuitable for processing in the main plant; the depot will process them in the static detonation chambers. As of the end of FY 2020, the program has destroyed 58.3 percent of the chemical agents at the two depots. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 set 31 December 2023 as the deadline for destruction of all U.S. chemical weapons.

## Legal

The  Judge  Advocate  General  Corps  in  FY  2020  had  1,850  judge advocates in the active component, 2,589 judge advocates in the reserve components, and 1,400 civilian attorneys and paraprofessionals.

The Office of The Judge Advocate General worked to ensure the availability of appropriate legal assets for new organizations such as Multi-Domain Task Forces and forward corps-level headquarters. To improve services in existing responsibilities, it obtained authorization for  the  hiring  of  140  additional  attorneys  and  paralegals  dedicated to supporting domestic violence victims, special victims council, and criminal investigation. The Army fully implemented the Military Justice Redesign  to  thirty-eight  installations  and  unit  Offices  of  the  Staff Judge Advocate. This initiative increases litigation experience in trialfocused  military  justice  practitioners  and  also  ensures  commanders receive dedicated military justice advice.

In FY 2020, 486 records of trial and over 1,000 motions and briefs were referred to one of the three judicial panels comprising the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA) for judicial review. Of those 486, ACCA received 442 for the first time (not a remand from the Court of

Appeals for the Armed Forces or returned from the convening authority after  remand).  Of  these  cases,  it  processed  77  under  pre-Military Justice  Act  of  2016  procedures  involving  a  promulgating  order  and processed 365 under Military Justice Act of 2016 procedures involving an entry of judgement. For pre-Military Justice Act of 2016 cases, the average processing time for those 77 courts-martial from sentencing to convening authority action was 243 days. In 6 of those 77 cases, initial action was completed by the convening authority within the 120 days prescribed by United States v. Moreno . ACCA received fifty-eight of  the  records  within  thirty  days  of  convening  authority  action.  In 249 of the 365 Military Justice Act of 2016 cases, ACCA completed the certification of the record of trial within 120 days. ACCA received 285 of the Military Justice Act of 2016 cases within 30 days of the completion of certification of the record of trial or entry of judgement. ACCA rendered an initial decision in 409 cases in FY 2020, with an average  processing  time  of  201  days  from  receipt  of  the  record  of trial by the clerk of court to decision by ACCA. Of the 409 decisions, ACCA issued 405 within the 18-month period prescribed by United States v. Moreno .

At the end of FY 2020, the Army had 278 pending courts-martial cases, 38 of which were referred for trial by courts-martial, with the remainder pending disposition decisions. Tables 14 through 19 present data on cases completed in FY 2020.

## Historical Activities

The National Museum of the United States Army is a 185,500-squarefoot building at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, containing 11 galleries displaying nearly 1,390 artifacts. The museum is a joint effort between the Army and the Army Historical Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The Army  Historical  Foundation  constructed  the  building  with  private funds. The Army is providing the infrastructure, roads, utilities, and exhibit work. The Army owns and manages the museum.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening date for the museum had been set for 4 June 2020. On 16 April, the Army announced that because of the pandemic it would postpone the museum's opening. By the end of FY 2020, the Army had not announced a new opening date, but it will attempt to open the museum early in FY 2021 with enhanced health and safety measures for visitors and staff.

## 10 Conclusion

The first half of FY 2020 was for the Army much like FY 2019. The service began the new fiscal year operating on a continuing resolution instead  of  an  approved  budget.  The  Army  continued  its  efforts to  prepare  for  large-scale  combat  operations  with  modernization initiatives  in  personnel  practices,  technology,  doctrine,  organization, and enterprise business processes. Training to improve and sustain units' readiness  coexisted  with  a  continuing  high  demand  for  Army  forces to conduct combat operations, provide deterrence, test new concepts, maintain ties with other armies, and support domestic disaster relief and border security operations. Combat operations continued to kill and wound soldiers.

The first half of FY 2020, however, ended with the COVID-19 outbreak becoming first an epidemic and then a pandemic. For the Army,  the  virus  created  interrelated  missions:  protecting  the  force to maintain readiness for overseas deployments and continuing vital modernization  efforts  while  at  the  same  time  providing  support  to civil authorities dealing with the pandemic's many challenges. Overall, the service accomplished the protection mission, but at some costs in readiness imposed by delayed, modified, or canceled training. There were some costs as well to modernization, mainly from delayed testing of  new  materiel  and  concepts.  The  pressure  on  both  readiness  and modernization eased, but did not disappear, as the Army transitioned from a posture of immediate response to one of sustained operations in  a  COVID-19  environment  in  June  using  the  various  mitigation measures developed since March.

The  reserve  components  provided  almost  all  the  personnel  and units used in one of the largest and longest support to civil authorities operations  in  the  Army's  history.  Governors  used  their  ARNG soldiers for a variety of tasks, from staffing COVID-19 testing sites to  assisting  hard-pressed  food  banks.  The USAR stood up the new urban augmentation medical task forces and deployed them across the nation. The RA's main contributions were medical personnel deployed to severely affected areas and the Corps of Engineers' alternate care site program.

Although constrained during the second half of FY 2020 by the pandemic,  the  Army's  modernization  campaign  saw  some  notable achievements. Publication of The Army Modernization Strategy supported implementation of The Army Strategy . Recognition of the importance  of  digital  technology  produced  the  separation  of  HQDA 's CIO/G-6 into two offices and the publication of the Army Cloud Plan. Publication  of The  Army  People  Strategy, implementation  or  initiation of several talent management programs, and Project Inclusion acknowledged that modernization includes better personnel practices for an all-volunteer force. Army Futures Command issued several important doctrinal concepts for multidomain operations and launched Project Convergence. The Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model will provide a flexible, predictable force generation process.

The second half of FY 2020 also brought the Army its largest deployment in decades to support law enforcement during civil unrest. The killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis sparked protests  at numerous  locations  around  the  nation.  The  ARNG provided all the soldiers, but the DoD did order an infantry battalion and a military police battalion from the RA deployed to sites near the District of Columbia. The unrest also led the secretary of the Army, the chief of staff, Army, and the sergeant major of the Army to publish a message. It reminded soldiers and civilian employees that they had sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution and emphasized that racial division eroded the trust between soldiers as well as the trust between the Army and the American people.

The murder of Spc.Vanessa Guillén by a fellow soldier called into question the effectiveness of how the Army's organizational culture built  and  sustained  trust  between  soldiers.  Reports  that  leaders  in Specialist  Guillén's  unit  had  responded  ineffectively  to  her  sexual harassment,  and  that  another  soldier  had  accused  her  murderer  of sexual  harassment,  generated  widespread  criticism  of  the  Army's SHARP program. An independent review of the command climate and culture at Fort Hood and an Army 15-6 investigation of issues regarding Specialist Guillén's murder remained underway as the fiscal year ended.

The  Army  began  FY  2021  without  an  approved  budget.  The congressional continuing resolution that enabled the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2020 levels for both the base and the OCO budgets. The continuing resolution did not extend defense emergency funding for natural disasters or response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new fiscal year, however, did hold the promise of a COVID-19 vaccine.
