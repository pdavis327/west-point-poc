## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2019

## 1

## Introduction

For  the  first  time  in  ten  years,  the  Army  entered  the  new  fiscal year (FY) operating on an approved budget instead of a continuing resolution. This new fiscal stability was welcome in a competitive and volatile global security environment. The implementation of the Army Vision, released in June 2018, continued in accordance with the Army Strategy released at the start of FY 2019. The demand from combatant commands  for  Army  forces  remained  high,  and  American  soldiers continued to be killed and wounded in action. Senior Army leaders set readiness and modernization as the service's highest priorities. To that end, they continued several efforts begun in earlier years to improve organizations, processes, and concepts in these two areas, and initiated other improvements during FY 2019.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

During fiscal year (FY) 2019, the president nominated Secretary of the Army Mark T. Esper to be secretary of defense, and nominated the chief of staff of the Army, General Mark A. Milley, to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president nominated Under Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy to succeed Esper. After being confirmed by the Senate, McCarthy was sworn in as secretary on 30 September 2019. The president nominated the vice chief of staff of the Army, General James C. McConville, to succeed General Milley. After being confirmed by the Senate, General McConville was sworn in as chief of staff of the Army on 9 August 2019.

Headquarters, Department  of  the Army  (HQDA),  General Orders 2019-01, published in May 2019, revised a number of HQDA functions and responsibilities. The secretary of the Army was given specific authority to prescribe the relationships of each office in the Secretariat and the Army Staff. Additional responsibilities given to the chief of staff included acting as the secretary of the Army's executive agent to supervise Army major commands, Army service component commands, and direct reporting units in the execution of approved plans and recommendations. An additional responsibility assigned to the vice chief of staff was assisting the chief of staff in the execution of  missions  and  functions  related  to  manpower  and  personnel; operations and plans; requirements and programs; command, control, and communications; installations and facilities; medical care; military construction;  force  protection  and  law  enforcement;  modernization; readiness; and acquisition and logistics.

The revision added a statement that the primary purpose of the Secretariat and the Army Staff is to support the secretary and the chief of staff in exercising their duties and responsibilities; supporting the service's war fighting units; and supporting the service's soldiers, civilian employees, and their families. The revision directed the Secretariat and the Army Staff-in  providing  that  support-to  give  the  view  of  commanders  in the field particular weight and primacy in all issues facing the Army . The Secretariat is responsible for developing and recommending policies and programs, typically published in Army directives, and overseeing their implementation. The Army Staff is responsible for providing military advice to the Secretariat regarding policies and programs, and it is charged with planning policies and programs, supervising their execution, and reporting their performance and progress. After being removed from the Secretariat in the 2017 revision, the director of Small Business Programs returned to the Secretariat in the 2019 revision. The 2019 revision removed the chief, National Guard Bureau, from the Army Staff and added the director, Army National Guard, to the Army Staff.

The Army Reform Initiative (ARI) dictated two major changes in installation management organization during FY 2019. In March 2019,  U.S.  Army  Installation  Management  Command,  formally  a direct reporting unit to HQDA, was realigned as a major subordinate command of U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC). This realignment consolidated  base  operations  and  other  similar  support  functions under one command and leveraged the Army's existing expertise in logistics, sustainment, and services. Additionally, the secretary of the Army restructured oversight of installation resource programming and  budgeting  by  assigning  the  AMC  commanding  general  as  a cochair with the assistant secretary of the army (installations, energy and  environment)  (ASA  (IE&amp;E))  for  the  installation  management resource programming process.

In September 2019, HQDA's assistant chief of staff for installation management  was  redesignated  as  the  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-9.

The change from assistant to deputy chief of staff better aligns the position's title with its corresponding three-star rank, with functions and responsibilities transferred to the G-9. The G-9 portfolio includes housing; military construction and infrastructure investment; facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization; child care; energy and water security; resilience and sustainability; installation environmental management and stewardship; and other installation related concerns. The G-9 serves as principal military adviser to the ASA IE&amp;E, and advises  the  assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (manpower  and  reserve affairs) (ASA M&amp;RA) on soldier and family readiness support.

In October 2018, the Army began steps to reassign two major organizations from the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM). The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (MRMC) was redesignated in June 2019 as the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. It will be realigned to the AMC in early  FY  2020.  In  early  FY  2020,  MRMC's  materiel  assets  will become the U.S. Army Medical Logistics Command under AMC. MRMC's medical research, development, and acquisition elements will be transferred to U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) in FY 2020. The U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School was redesignated  as  the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Center  of  Excellence  in mid-September 2019, and will be realigned from MEDCOM to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in early October 2019.

AFC, established in FY 2018, reached full operating capability in  July  2019.  The  command's  mission  is  to  modernize  the  Army by  developing  future  force  requirements,  designing  future  force organizations, and delivering prototype materiel capabilities. As part of  reaching  full  operating  capability,  two  organizations  realigned under AFC. In December 2018, the U.S. Army Capabilities Integration Center  was  redesignated  as  the  U.S.  Army  Futures  and  Concepts Center and realigned from TRADOC to AFC. U.S. Army Research, Development,  and  Engineering  Command  was  redesignated  as the  U.S.  Army  Combat  Capabilities  Development  Command  and transferred from AMC to AFC in February 2019. Additionally, in December 2018, the U.S. Army Reserve Headquarters, 75th Training Command, was redesignated the U.S. Army Reserve 75th Innovation Command. The command will remain part of the Army Reserve. Its mission is to leverage the skills, agility, and private sector connectivity of the Army Reserve in direct support to AFC.

The  U.S.  Army  Rapid  Capabilities  Office  was  created  in  2016 to  expedite  the  delivery  of  critical  combat  materiel  capabilities,  as identified by combatant commands, to soldiers by quickly developing,

acquiring, and prototyping equipment. In December 2018, the office became the U.S. Army Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office in a shift of its mission. It now concentrates on emerging critical technologies that do not fall under program executive offices or AFC cross-functional teams and fields them as quickly as possible.

In  December 2018, the under secretary of the Army approved the U.S. Army Logistics Innovation Agency reform plan. The plan renamed  the  organization  as  the  U.S.  Army  Logistics  Enterprise Support  Agency  (LESA)  but  did  not  change  its  status  as  field operating  agency  under  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff, G-4. The LESA has three primary functions: (1) improve readiness by synchronizing efforts to ensure that Class V (ammunition) and Class VII (general equipment) supplies are auditable; (2) synchronize efforts to operationalize logistics data and analysis within enterprise decision support capabilities such as the Army Leader Dashboard; and (3) synchronize efforts to ensure business processes are standardized, auditable, and integrated across domains to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of defense business systems.

In  May  2019,  the  U.S.  Army  Marketing  and  Research  Group,  a field operating agency of the ASA M&amp;RA responsible for conducting the  service's  national-level  marketing  and  advertising  program,  was redesignated  as  the  Office  of  the  Chief,  Army  Enterprise  Marketing. Furthermore,  it  was  reassigned  as  a  field  operating  agency  of  the deputy chief of staff, G-1, and relocated from Arlington, Virginia, to Chicago, Illinois. In 2018, the Army Audit Agency (AAA) found the U.S. Army Marketing and Research Group did not sufficiently oversee the performance of its primary contractor and the products included in its three main marketing and advertising contracts. The Army chose a new advertising contractor whose main office is in Chicago. Moving the Office of the Chief, Army Enterprise Marketing, to that city will improve  contractor  coordination  and  oversight.  The  new  office  is expected to reach full operational status by February 2020. Its missions are to coordinate the Army's national marketing and advertising strategy, develop and maintain relationships with the marketing and advertising industry, and develop marketing expertise and talent within the Army to support the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve.

In  October  2018,  the  U.S.  Army  Marketing  and  Engagement Brigade  was  discontinued  as  a  direct  reporting  unit  to  the  ASA M&amp;RA and was reassigned as a subordinate element of TRADOC. That command then assigned the brigade to U.S. Army Recruiting Command. The brigade's major elements are the U.S. Army Parachute Team,  the  U.S.  Army  Accessions  Mission  Support  Battalion,  and the  U.S.  Army  Marksmanship  Unit.  Its  mission  is  to  influence  the

American  people  to  join  the  Army  by  enhancing  and  conducting recruiting operations through direct engagements and demonstrating elite army skills and exhibits. This realignment is expected to enable a more effective, integrated, and synchronized use of accession resources.

In November 2018, the secretary of the Army directed the establishment of pilots to explore different alignment structures of the U.S. Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA) and Civilian Personnel Advisory Centers (CPAC). Two options tested included: placing a CPAC under a U.S. Army Installation Management Command garrison and a CPAC under an Army command. In accordance with this guidance, CHRA established a pilot at the U.S. Military Academy and another at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The original end date of the pilots was 20 September 2019, but this was extended to 1 March 2020.

In FY 2019, HQDA established the U.S. Army Strategic Support Element as part of the U.S. Army Office of Technology and Operations, G-3, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The element analyzes vulnerabilities in Army operations and acquisitions to provide analysis and recommendations to support the service's senior leaders' decision-making process.

As part of the ARI, TRADOC proposed, and HQDA agreed, that the U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH), a field operating agency  under  the  Office  of  the  Administrative  Assistant  to  the Secretary of the Army (OAA), be moved to TRADOC. During this realignment, The Institute of Heraldry transferred out of CMH and remained a subordinate element of OAA. CMH was to move under TRADOC  as  a  subordinate  organization  reporting  directly  to  the command's deputy commanding general. During FY 2019, TRADOC and CMH made preparations for this change, which will be effective on 1 October 2019.

## Management

The ARI began in April 2018 after Secretary Esper determined that HQDA had become too large and assumed too much authority. This increase placed greater burdens on subordinate commands, narrowed the authority of leaders in the field, and imposed unnecessary delays in completion of actions. The intent of the ARI is to push authorities and responsibilities down to the lowest level capable of exercising them and place more decision-making authority in commands across the Army. A smaller HQDA will focus on policy, enterprisewide priorities, and matters of strategic importance.

The  ARI  identified  HQDA  core  tasks.  It  then  determined noncore activities and lower-priority tasks to reduce or eliminate; tasks  and  functions  to  move  to  subordinate  commands;  business

processes  to  automate;  and  processes,  procedures,  and  reports to modify  or  eliminate.  Army  major  command  headquarters participated in the ARI as well. They used the same identification process to evaluate their relationships with subordinate commands. The  commands  also  proposed  realigning  tasks  and  functions  to them from HQDA.

The  ARI  working  group  received  690  recommendations  from HQDA and major commands, and assessed each as providing high value, medium value, or low value if implemented. It created categories for the recommendations. Category A addressed efficiencies, such as terminating unnecessary processes or realigning where certain tasks should be accomplished. Category B addressed manpower and risk analysis.  Category  C  addressed  headquarters'  structural  efficiencies. Category D addressed continuous process improvement and business process reengineering. The Army's Office of Business Transformation was the HQDA lead office for the initiative. During FY 2019, the office reviewed and oversaw the completion of the first set of changes under ARI across all four categories.

As part of the Army's effort to reduce manual processes, the Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Financial  Management and Comptroller) (ASA FM&amp;C) Robotic Process Automation program completed sixteen automation projects in FY 2019. These auto-mations produced time savings of 25,132 hours annually. They also improved financial management accuracy and compliance, while resolving and providing insights into enterprisewide challenges, to include unliquidated obligations and unmatched transactions.

In  June  2019,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  and  the National  Archives  and  Records  Administration  (NARA)  issued  a memorandum directing federal agencies to transition recordkeeping to fully electronic formats that comply with all records management laws and regulations. By 2022, agencies will manage all temporary and  permanent  records  in  electronic  format  and  with  appropriate metadata.

Additionally, agencies will develop plans to close agency-operated storage  facilities  for  temporary  paper  records  and  transfer  those records by 31 December 2022 to either federal records centers operated by NARA or commercial storage facilities. After 31 December 2022, NARA will no longer accept new transfers of permanent or temporary paper  records.  It  will  continue  to  store  paper  records  until  their scheduled disposition.

The  Records  Management  and  Declassification  Agency,  a  subordinate element of OAA, engaged the AAA to conduct a comprehensive review of Army records management policy, procedures, and

plans. This review supports the Army's efforts to meet the Office of Management and Budget's June 2019 directive that federal agencies transition their recordkeeping to a fully electronic format by the end of 2022. During FY 2019, the Records Management and Declassification Agency reviewed 5.9 million pages of permanent, historical records for automatic declassification.

## Information Management

In June 2019, the HQDA chief information officer/deputy chief of  staff  G-6  (CIO/G-6)  issued  a  memorandum  providing  guidance to ensure mission-essential records are retained while unnecessary  items  are  eliminated,  thereby  reducing  data  storage  costs. The memorandum facilitates removal-from computer hard drives, local shared network drives, or cloud-provided solutions-of documents and information with no legal, fiscal, operational, historical, or business value to an organization. The guidance did not apply to the email of political appointees, general officers, Senior Executive Service members, or Schedule C personnel whose email is subject to  automatic  archiving.  This  guidance  remains  in  effect  until  the Army fields an automated records management process.

An August 2019 Army Directive established a policy for issuing government-owned  portable  electronic  devices  such  as  phones  and tablets.  It  set  the  number  of  devices  available  for  issue  to  general officers,  Senior  Executive  Service  members,  and  unit  commanders down to the company echelon. In response to this policy, by the end of  FY  2019  the  Army  suspended  3,323  devices,  disconnected  2,747 devices, and placed 1,092 devices on lower-cost service plans for a total annualized savings of $3.5 million.

Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  12  mandates  all federal agencies migrate to the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) authentication credential to allow network access interoperability across the government. The Department of Defense (DoD) chief information officer directed the military services to comply no later than 1 May 2020. By the end of FY 2019, 82 percent of the Army's 1.4 million users utilized PIV-enabled Common Access Cards. The HQDA CIO/G-6 is working with U.S. Army Cyber Command to address  the  remaining  users,  believed  to  be  soldiers  who  do  not regularly access a military network.

On 29 September 2019, the Army replaced the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) Web portal with AKO 2.0. The new portal allows users to continue to access AKO content and files while providing a cloudready  virtualized  infrastructure  platform  for  future  migration.  The

Program  Executive  Officer  for  Enterprise  Information  Systems  will decommission the AKO portal by the end of December 2019.

During FY 2019, HQDA migrated 130 of 142 critical enterprise applications to a Microsoft Azure Cloud environment. The Army currently pays the Joint Service Provider, a field operating agency of  the  Defense  Information  Systems  Agency,  $19  million  per year  to  house  critical  HQDA  enterprise  applications  in  a  legacy Pentagon data center. In 2018, the CIO/G-6 took on the HQDA legacy network as a cloud pathfinder with the intent of reducing operational risks to critical enterprise applications and data. The G-6 expects to completely decommission the HQDA legacy Secret IP  Router  Network  and  Nonclassified  IP  Router  Network  by December 2019.

In  February  2016,  the  deputy  secretary  of  defense  directed  the DoD to transition to Microsoft Windows 10. The intent of this change was to strengthen the department's cybersecurity posture while concurrently streamlining the information technology operating environment. In FY 2019, the Army completed this transition.

The Army published revisions of two information management regulations during FY 2019. The revision of Army Regulation 25-1, Army  Information  Technology ,  updated  responsibilities;  added  new DoD information network lifecycle replacement planning rates  and activities; established  the  Migration  Implementation  and  Review Council; updated Army enterprise architecture processes, and provided new servicewide strategic  planning  policy  guidance  for  standard  lifecycle replacement of information technology assets. The revision of Army Regulation  25-2, Army  Cybersecurity ,  assigned  responsibilities  and prescribes policies for the Army cybersecurity program in accordance with DoD instructions; integrated cybersecurity into system lifecycles; implemented a standard and integrated change management process for Army information technology.

## Audits

The DoD inspector general completed a review of the quality control system in the Army Internal Review Program for the three-year period  ending  31  December  2018.  Quality  control  encompasses  the program's organizational structure, the policies adopted, and procedures established to provide it with reasonable assurance of conformity with the December 2011 version of the Government Auditing Standards issued by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The program received a 'pass with deficiencies' rating. Previously, it received  a  'fail'  rating  in  FY  2017.  The  Office  of  the  ASA  (FM&amp;C)

concurred with the inspector general's findings and began working to implement the report's recommendations.

A  new  Army  internal  review  program,  hosted  on  a  SharePoint Web site,  replaced  the  program's  AKO  Web  site.  The  Office  of  the ASA (FM&amp;C) developed a new internal review standard  operating procedures document for use by internal review offices and established a repository of auditing templates. In April 2019, it began collaborating with the AAA's Data Analytics Cell to provide military pay, civilian pay, and government purchase card datasets to internal review offices in support of audits and financial audit readiness sample testing.

The Army opened FY 2019 with the development of 464 Corrective Action Plans (CAP) or Memoranda for Record in response to the 429 notice  of  findings  and  recommendations  (NFR)  received  from  the previous year's audit of its financial statements. This effort focused on four key areas for FY 2019: asset assurance (valuation, existence, and completeness); information technology general controls; universe of transactions; and fund balance with the Treasury. The service began the fiscal year manually tracking these remediation actions. By the end of FY 2019 it automated its CAP management process in an Armyowned SharePoint site and transitioned to utilizing the Office of the Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  NFR  database  for  CAP  development, implementation, validation, and reporting. These changes allow the Office of the ASA (FM&amp;C) to move corrective action development and tracking down to the specific responsible organizations.

The audit of the Army General Fund financial statements for FY 2018 and FY 2019 by an independent public accounting firm resulted in  a  disclaimer  of  opinion.  The  firm  could  not  obtain  sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the reported amounts within the General Fund financial statements. As a result, it could not conclude whether  the  financial  statements  and  related  notes  were  presented fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The audit found twelve material weaknesses related to the Army's internal controls  over  financial  reporting.  The  Office  of  the  ASA  (FM&amp;C) concurred with the firm's findings.

## Budget

The Army's FY 2019 base budget request addressed increasingly dynamic  global  threats  outlined  in  the National  Defense  Strategy , aligned  with  the  priorities  established  by  the  secretary  of  defense, and continued the readiness improvements made with the FY 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act and FY 2018 budget. The request supports a Regular Army of 487,500, an Army Reserve of 199,500, an

Army National Guard of 343,500, and a civilian workforce of 194,803. The operation and maintenance budget enables the service to continue its focus on rebuilding readiness. The increase in research, development, and acquisition funds, as part of the Army's modernization strategy, is intended to reverse the erosion in technological overmatch against likely  opponents.  The  research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation budget balances upgrades to existing equipment to be fielded in the next  ten  years  with  developing  next-generation  capabilities  for  the future fight. The requested military construction appropriations targets the most critical facility needs for the active and reserve components: replacement of aging facilities that directly support unit readiness such as ranges, training facilities, and maintenance facilities (see Table 1. )

In the FY 2019 Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request, military  personnel  accounts  primarily  fund  mobilized  reserve  component soldiers  and  active  component  deployment  costs.  The  OCO operation and maintenance request supported Operation Freedom's sentinel (Afghanistan),  Operation inherent resolve (targeted  operations  against  the  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria),  the  E uropean D eterrence I nitiative , Operation spartan  shield (the  regionally aligned forces concept with partners in the Arabian Gulf region), and other  counterterrorism  operations.  The  research,  development,  and acquisition accounts fund replacement of battle losses, ammunition replenishment,  and  the  enhancement  of  pre-positioned  equipment stocks in Europe. The Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund builds key security  force  capabilities,  helps  professionalize  security  forces,  and promotes long-term stability of the Middle East region. This account replaces the Iraq Train and Equip Fund and the Syria Train and Equip Fund (see Table 2. )

In August 2018, the president signed the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, and for the first time in nine years the service began the fiscal year operating on its approved budget instead of a continuing resolution. Congress enacted an Army budget $2.2 billion lower than the amount the service requested, but it was $1.4 billion more than the executed amount in FY 2018.

On 15 February 2019, the president declared a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States and invoked four statutory  authorities:  Title  10,  U.S.  Code  §  12302,  authorizing  the secretary of defense to order up to one million members of the Ready Reserve to active duty service for up to twenty-four months; Title 10, U.S. Code § 2808, authorizing the secretary of defense to direct military construction funding to support the use of the armed forces in a national emergency;  Title  10,  U.S.  Code  §  284,  authorizing  the  military  to construct fences and roads and install lighting to block drug-smuggling

corridors  across  international  boundaries  of  the  United  States;  and Title 10, U.S. Code § 9705, authorizing the secretary of the treasury to provide money from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to other agencies for use in connection with law enforcement activities of any federal agency.

Under these authorities, the Army undertook several southwest border  missions  during  FY  2019.  The  first  was  Operation secure line , in which active duty military personnel supported U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Army spent approximately $98.2 million on  this  mission.  The  second  was  Operation guardian  shield ,  in which Army National Guard soldiers mobilized under Title 32 status. The service spent $193 million on this mission, of which $172 million was reprogrammed from the Regular Army's military personnel

appropriation and $21 million came from the humanitarian assistance supplemental appropriation.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted southwest border barrier construction operations. Construction at six locations, costing $2.5 billion, was funded by a transfer into the Army's FY 2019 Operations and Maintenance, Army, account in accordance with the Title 10, U.S. Code  §  284,  authority  from  the  Drug  Interdiction  and  Counterdrug Activities,  Defense,  appropriation.  Since  these  funds  transferred  into the  Operations  and  Maintenance,  Army,  account,  the  legal  one-year appropriation timeframe expired at the end of FY 2019. The secretary of defense approved southwest border construction projects under Title 10, U.S. Code § 2808, authority in the amount of $3.6 billion-funds taken  from  the  services'  military  construction  appropriations.  The Army's share of this diversion was $918 million.

The Army Budget Office conducted a midyear review in order to optimize  resources.  The  office  analyzed  command  budget  execution, collected  unfinanced  requirements  (UFRs),  and  developed  options. The  initial  UFR  list  included  309  requirements  totaling  $6.1  billion. The review resulted in the approval of thirty-four of the UFRs totaling $910.4 million. Internal budget adjustments and reprogramming actions funded these requirements. Among these UFRs was $75.8 million for U.S. Army Forces Command's (FORSCOM) southwest border support actions.

In  FY  2019  the  service  continued  the  'night  court'  review  of programs and spending. The review canceled or downsized programs not  contributing  to  the  six  modernization  priorities:  long-range precision fires,  next-generation  combat vehicle,  Future Vertical Lift, Army  network,  air  and  missile  defense,  and  soldier  lethality.  The funds freed by the review were then applied to modernization. This process  redirected  $10  billion  in  the  FY  2021/25  program  objective memorandum.

In  FY  2019,  the  Army  submitted  twenty-five  reprogramming packages, totaling $3.68 billion, to Congress-a 2.2 percent increase from  the  $3.6  billion  submitted  in  FY  2018.  As  of  the  end  of  FY 2019,  Congress  approved  twenty-four  of  these  requests.  The  Army reprogrammed an additional $1.85 billion in actions falling below the amount requiring congressional approval.

The service executed 99.7 percent of military personnel appropriations by the end of FY 2019, as well as 99.7 percent of the operation and maintenance appropriations in the base budget. It executed 99.9 percent of its OCO operation and maintenance appropriation.

The  research,  development,  and  acquisition  FY  2018/20  procurement  appropriations  finished  its  second  year  of  availability

with a 92 percent obligation rate, 2 percent ahead of the OSD goal. The  FY  2019/21  procurement  appropriations  achieved  a  75  percent  obligation  rate  against  the  80  percent  OSD  goal  in  the  first year  of  availability.  The  Army  executed  its  FY  2017/19  expiring procurement appropriations at 99.3 percent, leaving $141 million unobligated  across  five  procurement  appropriations.  It  expended 41.3  percent  of  its  current  FY  2019  research,  development,  test, and  evaluation  appropriation,  against  the  55  percent  OSD  goal. The Army also obligated 99.7 percent of its expiring year research, development, test, and evaluation appropriation.

In  the  FY  2019/23  military  construction,  Army,  appropriations, the service awarded nine of twenty-four projects in the base budget and one of the eight OCO projects. The DoD diverted some of this funding for the remaining projects to southwest border barrier construction. In some cases, the bids received for the remaining projects exceeded the program amounts. The service awarded all seventeen projects in the expiring military construction, Army, appropriations. In the FY 2019/23 military construction, Army National Guard, appropriations, the service awarded  nine  of  ten  projects. Six projects received awards from expiring military construction, Army National Guard, appropriations.  Two  of  three  projects  came  from  the  FY  2019/23 military construction, Army Reserve, appropriations. All eight projects received awards from expiring Army Reserve, appropriations.

In the FY 2019/23 family housing construction appropriation, one project at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, was awarded, and Increment 3 of a construction project at Camp Humphreys, Korea, was awarded. In the expiring family housing construction appropriation, the service awarded two  projects,  one  at  Rock  Island  Arsenal,  Illinois,  and  one  at  Camp Walker,  Korea.  In  accordance  with  the  Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2018, $6 million was rescinded from the Camp Walker project, but was mitigated by the use of bid savings. The family housing operations appropriation used 99.8 percent of executable funds.

The Army Working Capital Fund consists of two activity groups, supply management and industrial operations. The first group buys and manages spare and repair parts for sale to its customers, primarily Army operating units. The second group provides the Army's organic industrial  capability.  Unlike  profit-oriented  commercial  businesses, the working capital fund's goal is to break even over the long term by returning any monetary gains to appropriated fund customers through lower rates or collecting any monetary losses from customers through higher rates. The Army Working Capital Fund ended FY 2019 with a  cash  balance of $1.894 billion, $164.6 million less than the year's beginning balance. This result was within the operating requirement

range. Tables 3 and 4 present the total obligational authorities for base budgets and OCO for FY 2019.

The  FY  2020  budget  request  supports  a  total  force  of  480,000 soldiers in the Regular Army, 336,000 in the Army National Guard, 189,500 in the Army Reserve, and a civilian workforce of 194,934. The Army plans to conduct twenty-five combat training center rotations in FY 2020 and increase initial entry training for infantry soldiers from fourteen to twenty-two weeks. The request will fund increases to field artillery, air defense, intelligence, and engineer force structure.

When compared to the FY 2019 enacted appropriations, the FY 2020  base  budget  for  research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation increased  even  as  procurement  amounts  decreased.  A  decrease  in legacy system procurement and increased investment in modernization priorities  contributed  to  this  change.  With  the  FY  2020  request, the  Army  aligned  its  science  and  technology  funding  to  identify, develop,  and  demonstrate  technology  options  in  support  of  the  six modernization priorities.

The FY 2020 OCO request will cover the personnel costs associated with  deploying  active  and  mobilized  reserve  component  soldiers.  It supports Operation Freedom's sentinel , Operation inherent resolve , Operation spartan shield , and the european deterrence initiative . It  will  fund  replacements  for  equipment  lost  in  combat,  ammunition replenishment,  and  the  enhancement  of  pre-positioned  equipment stocks in Europe. This funding also will provide assistance to security forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East region. Tables 5 and 6 present the total requests for base budgets and OCO for FY 2020.

Although the beginning of FY 2019 interrupted the long-running trend of entering a fiscal year operating on a continuing resolution instead of an approved budget, that trend resumed at the end of FY 2019. The Army began FY 2020 under a continuing resolution, set to expire on 21 November 2019, which provided funding allocations pegged to FY 2019 enacted levels. As usual, operating under a continuing resolution placed restrictions on new starts, expansion of ongoing programs, production rate increases, and the ability to reprogram funds.

## Army Strength and Distribution

As of 30 September 2019, the Total Force stood at 1,010,633 soldiers. The active component end strength totaled 483,941 personnel: 78,128 commissioned officers, 14,282 warrant officers, 387,001 enlisted soldiers, and 4,530 military cadets. These numbers put the Regular Army (RA) at  5,941  soldiers  above  its  FY  2019  end-strength  goal.  The  Army National Guard (ARNG) and Army Reserve (USAR) also increased their numbers during fiscal year (FY) 2019. The ARNG's end strength was 335,973 (36,984 commissioned officers, 8,804 warrant officers, and 290,185 enlisted soldiers). This was lower than the FY 2019 authorized ARNG end strength  of  343,500  but  higher  than  the  ARNG's  endstrength  goal  of  335,500.  The  USAR  finished  the  fiscal  year  1,469 soldiers above its goal with 190,719 personnel (14,210 commissioned officers,  94  warrant  officers,  and  152,203  enlisted  soldiers).  Women constituted  15  percent  of  the  RA  force  structure,  18  percent  of  the ARNG, and 24 percent of the USAR. Racial and ethnic minorities constituted  42  percent  of  the  RA,  30  percent  of  the  ARNG,  and 46 percent of the USAR.

## Officers

The Army exceeded its officer accession goal of 10,410 in FY 2019. In  total,  the  Army  brought  in  12,130  new  officers  across  the  Total Force. As expected, accessions through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) accounted for the largest contingent of new officers. ROTC commissions totaled 5,605 (2,456 RA, 2,429 ARNG, and 720 USAR). The ROTC education delay and early commissioning options produced another 30 RA officers. In addition to these numbers, 972 officers  commissioned through the United States Military Academy (USMA)  at  West  Point.  Another  328  (183  RA  and  145  USAR) commissioned  through  in-service  Officer  Candidate  School  (OCS), and 1,248 utilized the college option OCS (1,070 RA and 178 USAR). The Call to Active Duty program and interservice transfers brought 267  new  officers  into  the  RA  from  the  reserve  components.  In  the

ARNG, an additional 562 officers entered through state-based OCS, and 104 through federal OCS.

During the fiscal year, seven RA and twenty-seven ARNG direct commissions  entered  into  the  basic  branches.  The  Judge  Advocate General's Corps (JAGC) received 147 RA, 91 USAR, and 95 ARNG direct  commissions.  The  Army  Medical  Department  received  958 RA, 1,063 USAR, and 471 ARNG direct commissions. The Chaplain Corps received 140 RA, 99 USAR, and 50 ARNG direct commissions.

The  Army  initiated the Battalion Commander  Assessment Program  (BCAP)  pilot  in  FY  2019.  The  BCAP  offers  a  new  way to assess an officer's fitness for battalion command. Officers on the Lieutenant  Colonel  Centralized  List  will  be  invited  to  attend  the program. The BCAP consists of a series of cognitive, noncognitive, physical,  verbal,  and  written  assessments.  The  results  of  these assessments, combined with the officer's standing on the Lieutenant Colonel  Centralized  List,  will  be  used  to  develop  a  new  order of  merit  list.  During  the  FY  2019  pilot,  twenty-seven  lieutenant colonels whose names appeared on the FY 2020 alternate command list  participated. After reviewing the results of the pilot, the Army will implement BCAP in FY 2020.

In  FY  2019,  the  USMA  began  transitioning  to  the  Market Model Branching System for assigning cadets to branches upon their commissioning. The Academy is serving as phase one of implementing the  system,  which  will  be  extended  to  the  ROTC  program  in  FY 2020. The goal of the new system, which is part of the Army Talent Alignment  Process,  is  to  better  pair  cadets'  talents  with  the  needs of  the  branches.  Under  the  old  system,  cadets  ranked  their  branch preferences and received assignments to a branch based almost entirely on their ranking in their class order of merit list.

Under the new system, cadets will continue to rank their branch preferences, but the commandants of each of the seventeen branches into  which  cadets  are  commissioned  will  now  rank  the  cadets  as most preferred, preferred, and least preferred for that branch. The commandants  will  determine  these  rankings  based  on  the  cadets' branching  resumes,  which  includes  their  test  scores,  transcripts, physical  fitness  scores,  and  a  personal  statement.  Additionally, cadets  may  interview  with  the  branches  that  most  interest  them; on  average,  cadets  in  the  USMA  Class  of  2020  interviewed  with three branches. Branch assignments will be made using a modified version  of  the  National  Resident  Matching  Program's  algorithm, which pairs medical school graduates with residency programs. One of  the  Army's  modifications  is  the  Branch  of  Choice  Active  Duty Service  Obligation,  which  increases  the  odds  of  a  cadet  receiving

one of their top choices for a branch. Cadets who select this option commit to serving eight years on active duty instead of the five years required of West Point graduates. Each most preferred and preferred grouping set by the branch commandants will be modified to place all cadets who selected this obligation, ranked by order of merit list, above all cadets in the grouping who did not select the obligation. Both branch commandants and cadets in the Class of 2020 locked in their respective rankings in September 2018. Cadets will receive their branch assignments in November 2019.

## Enlisted

Enlisted  recruitment  was  a  high  profile  issue  after  the  Army missed its recruiting goals in FY 2018. During FY 2019, the Army made a concerted effort to focus on twenty-two urban areas where earlier  recruitment efforts lacked. The Army also brought in more than  700  new  recruiters  to  expand  outreach.  Recruiters  updated their approach by shifting away from phone campaigns and mailings toward social media applications and internet outreach. In FY 2019, these endeavors yielded successful results. Enlistments in the urban areas improved by an average of 15 percent across all components, and  the  Army  issued  3.2  percent  fewer  conduct  waivers  than  the previous year. Minority enlistment also increased by 3 percent, and female  enlistments  reached  their  highest  level  since  2004.  USAR female  recruitment  numbers  reached  their  highest  levels  since  the early 1990s.

The RA exceeded its objective of 68,000 recruits by enlisting 68,185. The ARNG recruited 39,063 new soldiers, surpassing its 39,000 goal. An additional 3,140 former Regular Army soldiers transitioned into the ARNG. This brought the ARNG's total accessions to 41,685-455 soldiers short of its overall enlisted accessions objective. The USAR recruited  15,304  new  soldiers,  296  people  short  of  its  15,600  goal. Another 7,000 Inactive Ready Reserve soldiers transferred into units, and 1,945 former Regular Army soldiers transitioned into the USAR. Together, these sources left the USAR accessions 880 short of its total goal at 23,665 soldiers.

Retention was high across all components. The Regular Army set a retention goal of 50,515 for the fiscal year. It surpassed this goal by 886 soldiers. The ARNG retained 36,138 soldiers in its ranks, which exceeded its goal by 938. The USAR's retention goal was 13,434, and it retained 17,089 soldiers.

In  November  2018,  the  Army  made  the  first  adjustment  to retention control points in two years, granting exceptions to existing

time-in-service  limits  for  enlisted  soldiers  in  grades  E-4  to  E-7. Added  authorizations  for  drill  sergeants,  recruiters,  and  security force  assistance  brigades  created  a  shortage  of  noncommissioned officers,  especially  in  the  midcareer  grades.  Time-in-service  limits force  involuntary  retirement  or  separation  for  soldiers  who  have not  advanced  to  the  next  grade.  Raising  retention  control  points allows these soldiers to serve for several more years, fill high-demand positions, and possibly earn a promotion during that time, permitting them to remain on active duty.

In  FY  2019,  the  Army  began  a  multiyear  effort  to  revise  its enlisted centralized promotion board processes. The effort centers on a transition from time-based to merit-based policies and practices, and will begin with RA and Active Guard Reserve program soldiers. Under the  current  system,  soldiers  selected  for  promotion  by  a  centralized board are assigned a promotion sequence number based on a soldier's time in grade, time in service, and date of birth. As positions open for  that  grade,  soldiers  are  promoted  to  it  in  accordance  with  their promotion  sequence  number.  Under  the  revised  system,  soldiers selected  for  promotion  to  a  grade  will  then  be  sequenced  by  merit instead of seniority and promoted in accordance with the order of merit list as positions open. Additionally, the Army will use the list to inform assignment  decisions  such  as  development  and  career  broadening opportunities.  Soldiers  found  'not  fully  qualified'  by  a  promotion board a second time in the same grade will be denied continued service. Soldiers will have access to their order of merit listing by grade, career progression, and specialty through the Army Career Tracker Web site. In FY 2019, the transition to the new system began with the master sergeant promotion board. The revised system is expected to be fully implemented by FY 2021. Once it is implemented, the Army will stop using retention control points.

## Civilian Personnel

At the end of FY 2019, the Army comprised 271,726 appropriatedfund civilian employees and 26,904 nonappropriated-fund employees ( Table  7 ). As  in  the  previous  year,  Army  civilian  demographics mirrored or exceeded the representation of the total U.S. labor force in three of five diversity categories: minority status, disability status, and veteran status. During FY 2019, minorities accounted for 32 percent of the civilian  workforce,  veterans  50  percent,  and  disabled  persons 10 percent. Women were underrepresented in relation to the total labor force at 37 percent of the Army's civilian population. The median age of Army civilians for FY 2019 was 50.

Reducing the time taken to fill vacancies continued to be a main line of effort in civilian personnel management during FY 2019. In FY 2017, there were 83,822 new recruit fill actions, and the average time  from  job  announcement  to  the  selected  person's  start  work date was 141 days. The Civilian Human Resources Agency (CHRA) took steps to speed up the process. These steps included modifying the expedited referral process to allow Civilian Personnel Advisory Centers to issue one referral certificate instead of two. The CHRA also  conducted  a  streamlined  background  check  pilot  where  an employee could onboard after just the initial security check while undergoing  the  more  intense  clearance  process.  Finally,  CHRA experimented with limiting page length in applicants' resumes, and allowed employers to limit the areas of consideration to a smaller candidate pool. In FY 2019, the time from job announcement to the selected person's starting work was down to an average of 122 days, despite a rise in recruit fill actions to 107,966.

In  October  2018,  the  Army  announced  a  new  civilian  service recognition program. A bronze Army Civilian Service Recognition Pin will be bestowed on employees who ranked fully successful or above after one year of service. A silver version of the pin will be bestowed on employees who accumulate ten or more years of service whose rating of record is currently fully successful or above. A gold version of the pin will be bestowed upon their retirement from the Army to those employees  whose  rating  of  record  is  fully  successful  or  above.  This civilian  service  recognition  does  not  replace  career  service  emblems and Office of Personnel Management certificates awarded to civilians in recognition of credited federal government service.

## Special Topics

The  Military  Accessions  Vital  to  National  Interest  (MA VNI) program,  implemented  in  2009,  allowed  immigrants  with  special language and cultural skills to enter U.S. military service in exchange for  naturalization  if  they  maintained  honorable  service.  Since  2016, the  Army  has  not  accepted  new  MAVNI  applicants.  The  Army's implementation of the program nevertheless continued through FY 2019. During FY 2017, the Army extended the contracts of MAVNI recruits  in  the  Army  Reserve  Delayed  Entry  Program  by  one  year to allow time for additional security vetting, but the Department of Defense suspended the program in early FY 2018. As a result, upwards of forty MAVNI recruits already in the program received word they would be discharged. Three federal lawsuits ensued over concerns that the Army denied MAVNI recruits due process. The Army then extended the program for one year to allow for further vetting. Any individual recommended  as  unfavorable  received  a  suitability  determination notification, which provided the denied applicant the opportunity to present mitigating information in response. In June 2019, the secretary of the Army approved another extension to address the 1,570 MAVNI recruits still in the program awaiting initial entry training. The Army Review Boards Agency processed requests from 544 MAVNI recruits in FY 2019, allowing them to begin training. In total, just under 600 MAVNI soldiers entered training in FY 2019.

A November 2018 Army Directive revised the service's criteria and  procedures  for  determining  suitability  and  taking  suitability actions  regarding  the  selection  and  assignment  of  soldiers  to certain  positions.  These  positions,  which  require  unaccompanied access  to  vulnerable  populations,  are  OCS  cadre,  ROTC  cadre, certain USMA personnel, service school cadre, drill sergeants, and recruiters at the company level and below, and personnel serving in Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) authorized  positions.  This  directive  prescribed  a  standardized screening process for personnel considered for or serving in these positions. All screening requirements for these personnel outlined in  the  directive  must  be  met  before  assignment  to  a  designated position. Soldiers serving in designated positions will be rescreened every three years from the date of their initial assignment to the position. The directive included provisions for soldiers disqualified because of a screening to appeal that finding.

As  part  of  its  efforts  to  improve  readiness,  the  Department  of Defense  in  October  2018  directed  the  military  services  to  institute measures  to  reach  the  goal  of  having  only  5  percent  of  their

personnel  nondeployable.  A  November  2018  Army  Directive  set the criteria soldiers must meet to be considered deployable: they are administratively,  legally,  and  medically  cleared  for  employment  in any  environment  in  which  the  Army  is  operating  or  could  operate; they  can  operate  in  austere  areas  or  areas  that  regularly  experience significant  environmental  conditions  that  would  exacerbate  existing medical conditions; they can carry and employ an assigned weapon; they  are  capable  of  executing  all  individual  warrior  tasks  for  their assigned mission; they can operate while wearing body armor, helmet, eye protection, gloves, and/or  chemical  or biological protective equipment; and they are capable of passing the Army Physical Fitness Test or meeting the physical demands of tasks required for a specific deployment.

Soldiers  who  do  not  meet  these  criteria  for  more  than  six consecutive months, or six nonconsecutive months in a twelve-month period, will be processed for administrative separation. Soldiers who are  nondeployable  because  of  a  permanent  medical  condition  that makes them potentially unfit for the duties of their primary military occupational specialty will be referred into the Disability Evaluation System.  The  policy  includes  guidance  for  determining  exemptions to  these  criteria.  By  June  2019,  the  Army  reduced  the  number  of nondeployable soldiers to roughly 5 percent, down from 16 percent eighteen months earlier.

An  Army  Directive  in  April  2019  implemented  changes  to  the Family  Readiness  Program.  It  renamed  the  family  readiness  group the Soldier and Family Readiness Group to better connect families to soldier readiness. The name change did not change the group's status as a unit commander's program. The directive established the group's goals  as  providing  official  and  accurate  information,  connecting soldiers and families to the chain of command, providing a support network, and connecting group members with community resources on and off post.

In FY 2019, the Army established a Workplace Violence Prevention Working Group. The working group is building on recommendations developed  by  the working  group  convened  following  shootings committed by active duty personnel at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 and 2014. Its charter is to define workplace violence, develop an education process  for  prevention,  develop  a  reporting  mechanism  to  spread awareness, and set out how to establish workplace violence prevention and response teams at every Army installation. The working group expects to complete its work in FY 2020.

During FY 2019, the Army worked to comply with changes in the Transition  Assistance  Program  mandated  by  the  FY  2019  National

Defense Authorization Act. An Army Directive published in September 2019  set  out  the  changes  in  the  program,  which  will  go  into  effect at the start of FY 2020. Service members must begin the transition assistance process one year from their anticipated separation from the service.  The  previous  standard was ninety days. Other requirements include  the  mandating  of  a  self-assessment.  Following  completion of this assessment, each soldier will enter into a tier connected to a certain  level  of  transition  assistance  training  and  coursework  the service  member needs to complete. Separating soldiers also select  a post-transition  goal  of  either  employment,  entrepreneurship,  higher education, or vocational training.

In January 2019, a new Army Military Parental Leave Program began in response to provisions in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization  Act.  Primary  caregivers  are  able  to  take  up  to  six weeks of parental leave following the birth of a child. For female soldiers  designated  as  the  primary  caregiver,  they  may  add  the parental  leave  to  the  six  weeks  of  maternity  convalescent  leave previously  approved  by  the  Army's  leave  policy.  Parental  leave  is extended  from  ten  to  twenty-one  days  for  soldiers  designated  as secondary caregivers. The policy also provides a thorough definition for  primary  and  secondary  caregiver  designations,  timeframes  to designate,  and  defines  qualifying  birth  events  or  adoptions.  By doing so, the directive also provides guidance for service members with children born outside of marriage. Leave under this program is nonchargeable.

In April 2019, a new Department of Defense policy on military service  by  transgender  persons  and  persons  with  gender  dysphoria replaced the one instituted in 2016. For persons already in the Army, the major change concerned those with a gender dysphoria diagnosis. The old policy permitted these soldiers  to  continue  serving  in  their preferred gender upon completing transition. The new policy requires soldiers  who  are  not  exempt  to  adhere  to  the  standards  associated with their biological sex. Soldiers who receive a diagnosis of gender dysphoria  after  the  effective  date  of  the  new  policy,  and  who  are unable or unwilling to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with their biological sex, may be subject to the initiation of administrative separation processing.

For persons seeking to join the Army, the major changes concerned those with a gender dysphoria diagnosis and those with a history of medical  transition  treatment.  Under  the  old  policy,  the  first  group was presumptively disqualified from entry unless they had been stable for eighteen months in either their preferred gender or biological sex. Under  the  new  policy,  the  first  group  is  presumptively  disqualified

unless  stable  for  thirty-six  months  and  willing  and  able  to  serve in  their  biological  sex.  Under  the  old  policy,  the  second  group  was presumptively disqualified unless stable for eighteen months in either their preferred sex or biological sex. Under the new policy, the second group is presumptively disqualified.

Several  categories  of  individuals  are  considered  exempt  from the new policy. If, prior to the effective date of the new policy, the soldier entered into a contract for enlistment into the Army using a DD Form 4, or an equivalent, or was selected for entrance into an  officer  commissioning  program  through  a  selection  board  or similar process-and was medically qualified for military service or selected for entrance into an officer commissioning program in their preferred gender in accordance with the 2016 policy-the soldier is considered exempt. Additionally, serving soldiers are exempt if, prior to the effective date of the new policy, they received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from, or had such diagnosis confirmed by, a military medical provider.

The Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) is a Web-based human resource platform that will provide total force visibility,  talent  management,  and  auditability.  During  FY  2019, the Army began implementing IPPS-A Release 2. Release 1 began in FY 2015 and continued through the end of FY 2018. Release 1 interfaced with fifteen separate pay systems used across the Army and built  the  foundational  database  of  personnel  data  for  future releases.  Release  2  collapsed  separate  ARNG  pay  systems  into  a single system and provided mobile self-service capability to Guard soldiers. By the end of FY 2019, twenty-six states and the District of  Columbia  completed  fielding.  Fielding  across  the  rest  of  the ARNG will be complete by March 2020. Following the completion of Release 2, the Army will begin Release 3, which will provide the capabilities currently supported by the major field systems for the RA and the USAR, and subsume approximately thirty-four human resource and pay systems. Release 4 will introduce Global Payroll, and IPPS-A will become the authoritative data source for payroll for all components of the Army.

In addition to the IPPS-A Release 2, the service began fielding the  IPPS-A  Mobile  Application  in  January  2019.  It  will  become available  according  to  the  Release  2  fielding  timeline.  The  app provides  soldiers  access  to  their  Army  personnel  record  from  a mobile  phone  or  tablet  without  requiring  a  common  access  card for  authentication.  Soldiers  can  submit  help  inquiries,  request updates to their records, and monitor the status of their personnel actions. Commanders and human resource personnel can, by using

the  app's  common access  card  authentication  option,  review  and approve transactions.

In  November  2018,  the  Army  announced  it  would  field  a  new service uniform-the 'Army Greens'-based on the uniform used by the Army during World War II. The current Army Blues uniform will return to a formal dress uniform, while the Army Greens will become the  everyday  business  uniform  for  all  soldiers.  The  Army  Combat Uniform-also known as the Operational Camouflage Pattern-will remain the duty/field uniform. Enlisted soldiers will be able to purchase the Army Greens with their annual clothing allowance. The standard uniform will require pants and brown leather oxfords for both men and women. Women will have the option to wear a pencil skirt and pumps. It is expected that the Army Greens will be fielded to soldiers reporting to their first units as early as the summer of 2020. The mandatory wear date for all soldiers will be 2028.

## Expert Soldier Badge

In  FY 2019, the Army announced the creation of the Expert Soldier Badge. This badge is  equivalent  to  the  Expert  Infantry Badge and Expert Field Medical Badge but is open to all

other military occupational specialties. Beginning in FY 2020, Expert Soldier competitions will be held at the brigade level over a five-day period. Soldiers will need to pass the Army Combat Fitness Test, qualify expert on an individual weapon, pass night and day land navigation courses, and qualify in a series of warrior tasks selected by brigade commanders.

## Master Gunner Identification Badge

In March 2019, the Army authorized the Master Gunner Identification Badge. Soldiers, from all three components, who graduate from the Field Artillery Master Gunner Course, the Master Gunnery-M1/ M1A1 Tank Course, the  Infantry  Fighting  Vehicle  Master  Gunner Course, the Avenger Master Gunner Course, the M1A2 SEP Master Gunner Course,  the  Stryker  Master  Gunner  Course,  or  the  Patriot Master Gunner Course will be eligible to wear the badge. Veterans can request award of the badge retroactively if they meet the qualifications.

The  Army  also  began  allowing  soldiers  qualified  in  explosive ordnance disposal to wear the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)



brassard on their left sleeve fulltime. Previously, these soldiers could only wear the brassard when engaged in explosive ordnance disposal duties.

Master Gunner Identification Badge

The Army Review Boards Agency (ARBA) received 17,330 cases in FY 2019. More than 11,400 of these cases went  through  the Army Board for Correction of Military  Records  (ABCMR).  The Army Discharge Review Board received  1,740  cases  and  the  Army Physical Disability Review Board received 1,817 cases. The Army Clemency and Parole Board reviewed

1,419 cases. Other ARBA cases focused on disability evaluations, grade determinations, and other ad hoc issues.

The Army Clemency and Parole Board staff began meeting with U.S. Parole Commission staff regarding the return of parole authority for military prisoners incarcerated within the Federal Bureau of Prisons system. The Parole Commission is currently responsible for granting or denying parole and supervising those released from federal prison. The commission, however, will cease to operate after November 2021. There are currently 189 Army prisoners in the federal prison system for which ARBA will eventually assume parole authority of parole functions.

For the third year in a row, ABCMR did not meet mandated case processing times. According to Title 10, U.S. Code § 1557, ABCMR must complete final action on 90 percent of cases received within ten months and 100 percent within eighteen  months.  During  FY  2019, because of a large backlog of cases and an outmoded tracking system, ARBA added twenty new authorizations to its organization, increased the personal workload from two cases to three per week, and continued to work on fielding the ARBA Case Tracking System 2.0.

In 2016, the Department of Defense directed the military services to  review  more  than  1,300  valor  awards  from  the  Iraq  and  Afghan wars.  The  review  aimed  to  determine  possible  award  upgrades. During  FY  2019,  the  Army  completed  its  review  and  upgraded fourteen  Silver  Star  awards  to  Distinguished  Service  Cross  awards.

## Medal of Honor

Three soldiers received the Medal of Honor in FY 2019. Staff Sergeant Ronald J. Shurer II received the Medal of Honor for his

actions on 6 April 2008 in Afghanistan while serving as senior medical sergeant  with  Operational  Detachment  Alpha  3336,  Company  C, 3d  Special  Forces  Battalion,  3d  Special  Forces  Group,  1st  Special Forces Regiment. On that day, enemy forces attacked the detachment and a group of Afghan National Army commandos as they moved toward their objective. Staff Sergeant Shurer braved enemy machine gun, sniper, and rocket-propelled grenade fire to tend to a wounded soldier and then fought his way to the lead element where he treated and stabilized two more soldiers. He saw two other severely wounded soldiers and moved through intense enemy fire to treat them. Staff Sergeant Shurer began evacuating the wounded by using his own body as a shield while he lowered the wounded down the mountainside. After  setting  up  a  casualty  collection  point,  he  helped  load  the wounded onto a medical evacuation helicopter. Having ensured the safety of the wounded, Staff Sergeant Shurer then continued to lead his group of Afghan commandos until the end of the battle.

The  family  of  Staff  Sergeant  Travis  W .  Atkins  received  his posthumous award of the Medal of Honor for his actions on 1 June 2007 in Iraq while serving as a squad leader with Company D, 2d Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division. On that day, Staff Sergeant Atkins' squad was conducting route security in the town of Abu Samak when they observed suspected insurgents attempting to cross the route. He moved his squad to interdict the individuals, one of whom began behaving erratically. Staff Sergeant Atkins dismounted from his vehicle and approached the men to conduct a search. The

individuals responded belligerently toward Staff Sergeant Atkins, who then  engaged  the  individual  he  intended  to  search  in  hand-to-hand combat. When he noticed the insurgent was reaching for something under his clothes, Staff Sergeant Atkins immediately wrapped him in a bear hug and threw him to the ground, away from his soldiers. Staff Sergeant  Atkins  maintained  his  hold  on  the  insurgent,  placing  his body on top of him, further sheltering his soldiers. With Staff Sergeant Atkins on top of him, the insurgent detonated a bomb strapped to his body, killing Staff Sergeant Atkins.

Staff  Sergeant  David  G.  Bellavia  received  the  Medal  of  Honor for his actions on 10 November 2004 in Iraq while serving as a squad leader  with  Company  A,  2d  Battalion,  2d  Infantry  Regiment,  1st Infantry Division. On that day, while clearing a house, a squad from Staff  Sergeant  Bellavia's  platoon  became  trapped  within  a  room  by intense enemy fire. Staff Sergeant Bellavia exchanged weapons with an M249 squad automatic weapon gunner and entered the doorway of the house. He provided covering fire that allowed the squad to break contact and exit the house. A Bradley Fighting Vehicle was brought forward to suppress the enemy, but due to high walls surrounding the house, it could not fire directly at the enemy position. Staff Sergeant Bellavia reentered the house and observed an insurgent preparing to launch  a  rocket-propelled  grenade  at  his  platoon.  He  assaulted  the enemy  position,  killing  one  insurgent  and  wounding  another.  Staff Sergeant Bellavia, realizing there was an uncleared room to his back, moved to clear it. As he entered, an insurgent came down the stairs firing

at him. Simultaneously, the previously wounded insurgent reemerged and engaged Staff Sergeant Bellavia. Staff Sergeant Bellavia returned fire and killed both insurgents. Staff Sergeant Bellavia then received enemy fire from another insurgent emerging from a closet in the room. Exchanging gunfire, Staff Sergeant Bellavia pursued the enemy up the stairs  and  killed  him.  Staff  Sergeant  Bellavia  moved  to  a  door  that opened onto the roof. At this point, a fifth insurgent leapt from the third-floor  roof  onto  the  second-floor  roof.  Staff  Sergeant  Bellavia engaged the insurgent through a window, wounding him in the back and legs, and caused him to fall off the roof.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Force development is the process of determining Army doctrine, leader  development,  training,  organization,  soldier  development, and materiel requirements and translating them into programs and structures, within allocated resources to accomplish Army missions and functions. It supports Army Campaign Plan objectives through preparation of doctrine, modernization of equipment, and training programs.

During  FY  2019, the service sought to implement  the new  'Army  Vision'  released  in  June  2018.  The  Army  Vision stated the Army of 2028 will be ready to deploy, fight, and win decisively  against  any  adversary,  anytime  and  anywhere,  in  a joint, multidomain, high-intensity conflict, while simultaneously deterring others and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare. In October 2018, the Army released The Army Strategy to articulate how the service will achieve this vision over the next ten years. It stated the Army's central challenge was using finite resources  to  remain  ready  to  fight  tonight  while  simultaneously modernizing and preparing for a fundamentally different future. The  strategy  set  forth  a  phased  approach  focused  on  readiness, modernization,  institutional  reform,  and  maintaining  alliances and  partnerships.  Underpinning  this  strategic  approach  was  an enduring  commitment to taking  care  of  the  Army's  people  and upholding  the  Army  Values.  An  updated Army  Modernization Strategy and a new Army People Strategy will be published early in  FY  2020  to  further  support  implementation  of The  Army Strategy .

## Readiness

Readiness  remained  the  Army  leadership's  top  priority  during the year. Service leaders defined readiness as the ability for organized, trained,  and  equipped  forces  to  deploy,  fight,  and  win  decisively  in high-intensity conflict against any adversary, anytime, and anywhere. During  FY  2019,  readiness  levels  continued  to  improve.  From

The Army Strategy



September  2016  to  December  2018,  the  number  of  ready  Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) increased from eighteen to twenty-eight, and across all Army units readiness increased by nearly 11 percent. By the end of FY 2019, approximately half of the Army's fifty-eight Regular Army and Army National Guard BCTs reached the highest level of readiness.  Also  at  the  end  of  the  year,  approximately  30  percent  of Regular, Guard, and Reserve units reported being at the highest level of readiness. The service will continue to make rebuilding warfighting readiness its top priority through 2022, when the priority will shift to modernization.

## Doctrine and Future Force

The Army Strategy recognized that the Army needs to be ready for  high  intensity  conflict  against  near  peer  adversaries  as  part of the Joint Force, all while modernizing for future great power competition and sustaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare. To achieve this, the Army continued to develop its multidomain operations concepts during FY 2019, which was an evolution and further refinement of the multidomain battle concept published in 2017. In December 2018, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) published The U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations, 2028, to provide a foundation for continued discussion, analysis, and development of multidomain operations. TRADOC also released U.S. Army Concept: Multi-Domain Combined Arms Operations  at  Echelons  Above  Brigade,  2025-2045, in  December 2018. It recast the Army's divisions, corps, field armies, and theater armies into interdependent, echeloned, multidomain warfighting formations  equipped  with  the  capabilities  necessary  to  prevail in  future  large-scale combat. U.S. Army Futures Command will assume responsibility for continuing to develop the multidomain operations concept in the future.

During  FY  2019,  the  Army  continued  to  test  its  multidomain operations concepts through the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) pilot  program.  This  program,  established  in  FY  2017,  combined  a battalion-sized multidomain element with a rocket and missile artillery brigade. The 17th Field Artillery Brigade continued to operate as the MDTF pilot unit. The multidomain element, known as an I2CEWS (Intelligence, Information, Cyber, Electronic and Space) detachment, brought  together  all  of  these  capabilities  under  a  single  formation. The detachment is scheduled to become the 1st Cyber Detachment in September  2020. Together,  these  elements  tested the Army's multidomain concepts during various exercises in the Pacific region,

such  as  Exercise orient  shield where  the  MDTF  deployed  1,200 soldiers across Japan.

## Force Structure

During FY 2019, the Army continued to improve its force structure to  prepare  for  large-scale  combat.  The  FY  2019  National  Defense Authorization Act raised the authorized strength of the Total Army to 1,030,500-an increase of 4,000 soldiers. In addition, the Program Objective Memorandum for fiscal years 2021/25 supported the modest growth in several critical capabilities, to include a corps headquarters, a  CH-47  Chinook  helicopter  aviation  company,  a  short-range  air defense battalion, a Multiple Launch Rocket System battalion, and logistics elements.

During FY 2019, the total number of BCTs remained constant at  fifty-eight,  with  thirty-one  in  the  Regular  Army  and  twentyseven in the Army National Guard. However, the Army continued to convert two BCTs in order to create a sixteenth armored BCT. In  June  2019,  the  1st  BCT,  1st  Armored  Division,  stationed  at Fort Bliss, Texas, completed its conversion from a Stryker BCT to an armored BCT. The 2d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, located at Fort  Carson,  Colorado,  began  converting  from  an  infantry  BCT to a Stryker BCT; the process will be complete in spring 2020. At that point, the thirty-one BCTs in the Regular Army will consist of eleven armored, thirteen infantry, and seven Stryker. The mix of BCTs in the Army National Guard will stand at five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker.

During FY 2019, the Army continued working on the activation of six security force assistance brigades (SFABs), five in the Regular Army and one in the Army National Guard. The brigades will advise and assist partner nations in developing their security force capabilities and help preserve the Army's irregular warfare competencies. U.S. Central Command, U.S. Africa Command, U.S. European Command, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and U.S. Southern Command will each have one Regular Army SFAB aligned with it. The Army National Guard SFAB will align with U.S. Northern Command. In January 2019,  the  fourth  Regular  Army  SFAB  activated  at  Fort  Carson, Colorado, as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th Security  Force  Assistance  Brigade.  The  final  Regular  Army  SFAB activated in June 2019 at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, as  Headquarters  and  Headquarters  Company,  5th  Security  Force Assistance  Brigade.  The  Army  National  Guard  brigade  activated in  June  2019  as  Headquarters  and  Headquarters  Company,  54th

Security Force Assistance Brigade. Its headquarters is in Indiana and its six battalions are spread across Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas.

The Army continued to increase its fires force structure during FY 2019 in response to growing threats from near-peer adversaries. In  November  2018,  the  Headquarters  and  Headquarters  Battery, 41st  Field  Artillery  Brigade,  activated  in  Germany.  The  brigade's mission is providing long range, precision fires in Europe. It will also serve as the Army's test-bed unit for the Europe-based MDTF. The brigade's two subordinate battalions will be stationed in Germany and  equipped  with  the  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System.  The  1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, activated on 16 September 2019. The 1st Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Regiment, is scheduled to activate in September 2020.

The Army continued improving its air defense capabilities. The 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, activated in Germany in  October  2018.  This  battalion  is  equipped  with  the  short-range Avenger air defense system. In the Pacific region, the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, activated in Japan in October 2018. The brigade will provide greater oversight of  existing  Army  air  and  missile  defense  units  in  mainland  Japan, Okinawa, and Guam, and strengthen the Army's ability to cooperate with Japan Self-Defense Forces.

In  late  2018,  the  50th  Signal  Battalion  at  Fort  Bragg,  North Carolina, began serving as the pilot unit for the expeditionary signal battalion-enhanced  (ESB-E).  It  tested  a  more  modular,  scalable, and  agile  version  of  the  existing  expeditionary  signal  battalion organization. The pilot also evaluated tactical network equipment that relied  less  on  Warfighter  Information  Network-Tactical  equipment. Based on the pilot program's results, the Army will begin converting its expeditionary signal battalions to the ESB-E organization in FY 2020.

In  FY  2019,  the  82d  Airborne  Division  experimented  with  a provisional  armored  company,  a  capability  not  used  since  1997.  In October 2018, the division received a contingent of Light Armored Vehicle-25A2s, an eight-wheel vehicle equipped with a 25-mm. cannon. The provisional company tested the vehicle's suitability for airborne operations and evaluated its possible role within the division's global response force mission.

## Training

The Army Strategy called  for  training  to  focus  on  preparing for high-intensity  conflict  against  near-peer  adversaries.  The  strategy

emphasized  tough,  realistic,  recurring,  and  battle-focused  training with an emphasis on operating in dense urban terrain, electronically degraded environments, and under constant surveillance. To meet this objective, the Army pursued a number of efforts to improve individual and collective training.

The Army conducted nineteen combat training center rotations for brigade combat teams: ten at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin,  California  (eight  Regular  Army  and  two  Army  National Guard BCTs); eight at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana (six Regular Army and two Army National Guard); and one Regular Army BCT at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Germany. The Army increased the complexity of combat training  center  scenarios  to  train  for  multidomain  operations, incorporating electronic warfare, cyber, air defense, and long-range fires capabilities. Unit performance during these rotations revealed several types of collective skills that need additional emphasis during FY 2020: staff proficiency, synchronizing fires, reconnaissance, and security.

The Army Futures Command's Simulated Training Environment Cross-Functional  Team  spearheaded  efforts  to  improve  training simulators.  The  goal  is  to  integrate  live,  virtual,  constructive,  and game-based training environments into a single platform to allow for more frequent home-station training and to enhance the realism of training scenarios. Many of the Army's existing training simulators are based on 1980s and 1990s technology that do not work well together. To resolve such problems, the cross functional team worked to develop common 3-D terrain formats, referred to as One World Terrain, to support  large-scale  training  scenarios.  Another  effort  focused  on  a new Squad Advanced Marksmanship Trainer. Using improved virtual reality technology, the first such squad-immersive trainer was fielded to the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, during FY 2019. The Army plans to field the trainer and use it at twenty-eight locations by December 2019.

The Army worked to improve individual training and education. The  Army  Strategy called  for  the  Army  to  produce  better-trained infantry  by  extending  One  Station  Unit  Training  (OSUT)  at  Fort Benning, Georgia, from fourteen to twenty-two weeks. First piloted in July 2018, this was the first major overhaul to initial-entry training for  infantry  soldiers  since  1978.  The  expanded  program  resulted from  unit  requests  for  soldiers  to  be  ready  for  future  large-scale ground  combat  operations  upon  reporting  to  their  first  units.  In addition  to  the  fundamentals  of  marksmanship,  physical  fitness, and discipline, the new OSUT certifies infantry soldiers in combat

lifesaver skills, day and night land navigation, basic combatives, and urban marksmanship. Other branches may begin expanded OSUT in the near future.

Implementation  of  the  Army  Combat  Fitness  Test  (ACFT) continued.  A  new  six-event  test,  the  AFCT  will  replace  the  threeevent  Army  Physical  Fitness  test  introduced  in  1980.  The  new  test is  intended  to  improve  the  Army's  fitness  culture,  reduce  injuries, increase deployability, and increase the survivability of soldiers on the battlefield. During FY 2019, the Army began field testing the ACFT with sixty-three units and plans to make it the fitness test of record for all soldiers by October 2020.

The  Army  made  changes  to  the  ROTC  cadet  summer  training program at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The program increased from thirtyone to thirty-seven days. It now includes throwing live grenades, livefire  maneuver  events,  and  firing  M4  carbines  at  300-meter  pop-up targets instead of simulated paper targets at 25 meters. In addition,

forty cadets from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New  York,  participated  in  the  summer  training  as  part  of  a  pilot program to better integrate ROTC and West Point cadets.

## Operational Forces

During  FY  2019,  Army  units  engaged  in  a  variety  of  global operations  and  security  assistance  missions  with  multiple  foreign partners.  In  September  2019,  soldiers  operated  in  more  than  130 countries. Army troops also assisted with disaster relief and border security missions.

## Afghanistan

Operation  F reedom's S entinel in Afghanistan  continued  to require  significant  Army  support.  American  forces  in  Afghanistan have two missions: a counterterrorism mission against the remnants of al-Qaeda and a train, assist, and advise mission supporting Afghan security forces. During FY 2019, Army casualties for this operation suffered 23 killed and 146 wounded.

Elements  of  the  4th  Infantry  Division  headquarters  replaced elements of the 101st Airborne Division headquarters in December 2018,  serving  as  the  U.S.  Forces-Afghanistan's  National  Support Element.  In  August  2019,  elements  of  the  1st  Armored  Division headquarters replaced those of the 4th Infantry Division. Elements of  the  California  Army  National  Guard's  40th  Infantry  Division headquarters,  served  as  Train  Advise  Assist  Command-South  until March 2019 when elements of the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Division replaced it. These remained in Afghanistan until August 2019 and then returned to Fort Hood, Texas.

Five  augmented  BCTs,  two  SFABs,  and  two  combat  aviation brigades served in Afghanistan during the fiscal year to assist Afghan forces. The 2d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, remained in Afghanistan until November 2018 when the 2d BCT, 10th Mountain Division, replaced it. The 3d BCT, 82d Airborne Division, arrived in July 2019 to  replace  the  2d  BCT,  10th  Mountain  Division.  Meanwhile,  the 1st BCT, 4th Infantry Division, remained in country until January 2019  and  handed  off  to  the  48th  Infantry  BCT  (Georgia  Army National Guard), which departed in September 2019. In February 2019, the 2d SFAB arrived to replace the 1st SFAB, marking the successful conclusion to the Army's first deployment of this new unit specifically designed to advise and assist foreign military partners. In addition, in February 2019, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st

## Southwest Asia

During FY 2019, the Army continued to play a prominent role in Iraq, Syria, and Kuwait. The most significant operations occurred in the continuing fight against the remnants of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as part of Operation inherent resolve. Combined Joint Task  Force-Operation inherent  resolve (CJTF-OIR)  maintained control of land operations  In addition, the Army maintained forces . focused on theaterwide priorities as part of Operation spartan shield . Army casualties for FY 2019 in Operation inherent resolve totaled eight killed and six wounded.

During FY 2019, coalition forces continued to advise, train, and assist  partners  to  eliminate  the  remnants  of  ISIS.  American  forces partially withdrew from Syria during the year, but continued to assist local  partners.  On  23  March  2019,  the  Syrian  Democratic  Forces concluded a campaign to liberate the last physical territory held by ISIS  in  Syria's  Middle  Euphrates  River  Valley.  American  forces assisted  with  this  operation,  including  3d  Cavalry  Regiment,  which provided artillery support. In Iraq, coalition forces continued to train

Iraqi Security Forces and work with them to eliminate the last pockets of ISIS fighters hiding in remote regions of the country. In October 2018, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) also established a training and capacity building mission in Iraq to help strengthen the Iraqi Security Forces. The NATO Mission Iraq fell under the authority of the Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, Italy.

During FY 2019, the Army maintained a corps headquarters, and a BCT in the region to directly support Operation inherent resolve . In September 2019, the III Corps assumed responsibility for CJTF-OIR from the XVIII Airborne Corps in order to lead operations against ISIS with America's coalition partners to establish enduring security in the region. A BCT remained in the region to directly support CJTFOIR,  including  Iraqi  and  partner  forces,  with  intelligence  support, joint fires, aerial surveillance, and training. In January 2019, the 1st BCT, 101st Airborne Division, assumed these responsibilities from the 3d Cavalry Regiment. The 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division, replaced the 1st BCT, 101st Airborne Division, in September 2019.

The Army also maintained a division headquarters, an armored BCT,  and  an  aviation  brigade  in  Kuwait  to  support  theaterwide commitments  as  part  of  Operation spartan  shield .  In  November

2018, the headquarters of the 34th Infantry Division (Minnesota Army National  Guard)  deployed  to  Kuwait,  replacing  the  headquarters elements of the 28th Infantry Division (Pennsylvania Army National Guard). In July 2019, the headquarters elements of the 38th Infantry Division (Indiana Army National Guard) arrived to assume duties as the theater division headquarters. The 155th Armored BCT (Mississippi Army National Guard) replaced the 2d BCT, 1st Armored Division, in July 2018. In March 2019, the 155th passed its role as the theater's armored BCT to the 3d BCT, 4th Infantry Division. The Army also maintained  an  aviation  brigade  in  Kuwait  to  support  theaterwide operations.  The  244th  Aviation  Brigade,  an  expeditionary  combat aviation brigade from the U.S. Army Reserve, replaced the Combat Aviation Brigade, 35th Infantry Division (Mississippi Army National Guard), in May 2019. In addition to these forces, Army logistics and transportation units also served in Central Command areas.

## U.S. Army South

U.S. Army South is responsible for Army operations in Central and  South  America  and  the  Caribbean.  The  personnel  assigned  to this command support security cooperation, contingency operations, and fulfill requirements for Title 10 support and combatant command support agent missions for the Department of the Army and the U.S. Southern Command.

Exercises in FY 2019 included: beyond the horizon, tradeWinds, Fuerzas aliadas humanitarias, and  medical  readiness exercises. Florida Army National Guard soldiers from the 54th SFAB participated in the tradeWinds exercise in June 2019, marking the brigade's first overseas mobilization. The advisers helped bolster the defense capacity in the Caribbean and strengthen regional ties. U.S. Army South also hosted the Conference of the American Armies at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 5-7 February 2019. The conference is part of a two-year cycle of specialized conferences and is intended to create a guide for countering future threats to regional stability. In addition, the National Guard's State Partnership Program involved twenty U.S. states, plus Puerto Rico, and twenty-four partner nations in the region. U.S. National Guard forces conducted numerous engagements with partner nations as part of security cooperation efforts. The missions of Joint Task Forcebravo ,  stationed  at  Soto  Cano Air Base, Honduras, and its primary unit, the 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, include helicopter support to counter organized crime, medical readiness training, and disaster relief support. The 525th Military Police Battalion

and rotational military police units from the Army National Guard and Army Reserve support Joint Task Force-G uantanamo .

## U.S. Army Africa

U.S. Army Africa works to build capacity throughout the continent and support joint forces in order to disrupt transnational threats and promote regional  stability.  During  FY  2019,  the  command,  and  its aligned  units,  participated  in  numerous  training  exercises  related  to security cooperation; logistics and peacekeeping operations; and basic and  advanced  infantry  training.  These  exercises  included JustiFied accord and shared  accord. U.S.  Army  Africa  also  formed  the Combined  Joint  Task  Force  Headquarters  in  support  of aFrican lion , an annual exercise sponsored by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and scheduled by U.S. Africa Command, designed to improve interoperability among partner nations and strengthen relationships. In  2020,  U.S.  Army  Africa  will  assume  responsibility  for  a  greatly expanded aFrican  lion from  U.S.  Marine  Corps  Forces  Europe and Africa-currently running the exercise for the past sixteen years. U.S. Army Africa also participated in the 2019 African Land Forces

Summit in Botswana, where the participants focused on strengthening relationships with regional partners. U.S. Army units also served tours as  the  Combined  Joint  Task  Forcehorn  oF  aFrica and  its  East Africa Response Force (EARF), based at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti.

In October 2018, the 2d BCT, 101st Airborne Division, based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, assumed duties as U.S. Army Africa's regionally  aligned  force,  and  contributed  forces  to  operations  and exercises  across  Africa.  From  October  2018  to  March  2019,  one hundred soldiers assigned to the BCT's 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, deployed to Djibouti as part of the EARF. In January, this force demonstrated its rapid response capabilities when it deployed to Libreville, Gabon, in response to potential unrest in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the  Congo.  After  monitoring  the  situation for several weeks, the soldiers returned to Camp Lemonnier to await the next rapid response request. Approximately one hundred soldiers from the BCT's 1st Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment, also deployed to  Cameroon  from  October  2018  to  March  2019  as  part  of  Task Force talon .  These  soldiers  provided  security  and  force  protection at  Contingency  Location garoua in  Cameroon  for  the  task  force, which supported the Cameroonian military's fight against the violent extremist organization Boko Haram.

## Asia Pacific

U.S.  Army  Pacific  continued  its  Pacific  Pathways  program  to enhance  readiness  and  build  relationships  with  partner  militaries. Launched  in  2014,  Pacific  Pathways  combined  multiple  preexisting exercises with partner nations into integrated operations. The Army changed the program in 2019 to send troops to fewer countries for longer  periods  of  time.  Army  officials  expected  the  change  would allow mid- and high-level commanders in the participating units to become more familiar with each other's forces and doctrine to allow for  greater  responsiveness  in  an  emergency.  Each  of  the  pathways missions includes a multidomain component to test the Army's new operating concept.

In FY 2019, Pacific Pathways consisted of three iterations. During the  first  iteration,  launched  in  February  2019,  more  than  600  soldiers of  the  1st  BCT,  2d  Infantry  Division,  from  Fort  Lewis,  Washington, traveled to Thailand to participate in the hanuman guardian and cobra gold exercises. They later headed to the Philippines to participate in the balikatan and salaknib exercises, as well as additional jungle training. While in the Philippines, the brigade deployed to Palau for a short notice exercise with the island nation's military . This marked the U.S. Army's

first  major  presence  in  the  country  in  thirty-seven  years.  The  second phase of the 2019 Pacific Pathways-July to September 2019-focused on exercising the Army's long range fires and multidomain operations concepts.  The  17th  Field  Artillery  Brigade,  including  the  new  MultiDomain Task Force, participated in the talisman and hamel exercises in Australia, along with elements of the 2d Infantry Division Artillery and U.S. Marine Corps. Later, the 17th Field Artillery Brigade and elements of the 33d Infantry BCT (Illinois Army National Guard), participated in the orient shield exercise. The third Pacific Pathways exercise also ran  from  July  to  September  2019.  More  than  700  soldiers  from  the Hawaii-based 2d BCT, 25th Infantry Division, and the 33d Infantry BCT participated in exercises in Fiji ( cartWheel) , Indonesia ( garuda shield), and Singapore ( tiger balm/lightning strike). They also led members of  Japan's  Ground  Self-Defense  Force  on  a  reverse  pathway  exercise, rising thunder, at Yakima Training Center, Washington.

In 2004, the United States and the Republic of Korea governments agreed to move all U.S. forces to garrisons south of the Han River. Most of these forces will be relocated to Camp Humphreys, about forty miles south of Seoul on the west coast of the peninsula. During FY 2019, the relocation effort reached its final stages. In September 2019, the Army opened a new hospital facility at Camp Humphreys. The Army formally closed Camp Red Cloud, located north of Seoul, and continued making preparations for returning it and Y ongsan Garrison to the South Korean government.

The  armored  BCT  rotation  program  begun  in  2015  for  South Korea  continued.  The  3d  BCT,  1st  Armored  Division,  began  its nine-month  rotation  in  October  2018.  It  replaced  the  1st  BCT,  3d Infantry Division, which returned to Fort Stewart, Georgia. In June 2019,  the  3d  BCT,  1st  Cavalry  Division,  arrived  from  Fort  Hood, Texas, to assume duties as the rotational armored BCT on the Korean peninsula.  The  Army  also  continued  to  maintain  a  rotational  field artillery battalion equipped with the Multiple Launch Rocket System and an aviation battalion in South Korea during FY 2019. In October 2018, the 2d Battalion, 20th Field Artillery Regiment, was replaced by the 3d Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment. In July 2019, the 2d Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Battalion, arrived. The 1st Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment, concluded its rotation in March 2019 when the 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, replaced it.

## U.S. Army Europe

U.S.  Army Europe's Operation atlantic resolve demonstrates continued U.S. commitment to collective security in Europe. It reassures

NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region. As part of atlantic resolve ,  the Army continued to deploy U.S.-based land forces to Europe for nine-month rotations during FY 2019. These rotations allow units to build readiness and increase interoperability with allied and partner militaries through multinational  training  events,  such  as  the combined resolve series of  exercises.  Approximately  6,000  soldiers  participated  in atlantic resolve at any given time, conducting operations and exercises across seventeen countries.

The United States continued to bolster its presence in central and eastern Europe. In September 2019, the U.S. and Polish governments signed  a  joint  declaration  to  advance  defense  cooperation.  This agreement paved the way for the American military presence in Poland to  increase  by  approximately  1,000  personnel,  on  top  of  the  4,500 rotational forces already serving there. Among the provisions of the deal,  the  United  States  agreed  to  station  a  division  headquarters  in Poland. As such, the mission command element of the 1st Infantry Division's headquarters already located in Pozna , Poland, will change its status to 1st Infantry Division (Forward) in early October 2019 to signify its regional alignment with U.S. European Command and its commitment to training and operations. As part of the agreement, the Polish  government will  also  fund  the  construction  of  infrastructure to support American special operations forces, armored and combat aviation  brigades,  a  combat  training  center,  and  an  area  support group. This additional infrastructure will support deFender-europe , a  division-strength  deployment  of  20,000  soldiers  from  the  United States scheduled to begin in early 2020.

The U.S., in FY 2019, announced 500 soldiers and their armored vehicles from 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, would deploy to Lithuania. The battalion is part of a larger brigade rotation to Europe of the 2d BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, expected to arrive in October 2019. Unlike past deployments of Army battalions to Lithuania, this battalion's  mission  will  be  a  long-term  deployment  rather  than  an international exercise.

In addition to units permanently stationed in Europe, such as the 2d Cavalry Regiment and the 173d Airborne BCT, regionally aligned and rotational units also support U.S. Army Europe's missions. The headquarters  of  the  1st  Infantry  Division  continued  to  supply  a mission command element to oversee the rotational units and provide a  division-level  command  and  control  capability.  The  Army  also continued rotating armored BCTs to Europe. During FY 2019, the 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, served in Europe until February 2019 when it was replaced by the 1st BCT, 1st Infantry Division. In addition, in

M1 Abrams tanks of 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, at Smardan Training Area, Romania, 1 June 2019.



March 2019  the  Army  sent  the  2d  BCT,  1st  Armored  Division,  to Poland on a no-notice snap deployment. The brigade's 1,500 soldiers moved to Europe from Fort Bliss, Texas, in a week; drew pre-positioned equipment in Germany; and continued to training ranges in Poland to  conduct  three  weeks  of  exercises.  This  deployment  was  part  of the Dynamic Force Employment strategy for keeping adversaries off balance with unpredictable troop movements.

The Army continued to deploy forces to lead Battle Group Poland,  one  of  NATO's  four  enhanced  Forward  Presence  units.  The intent  of  these  battle  groups,  established  in  April  2017,  is  to  reinforce  NATO's  eastern  flank,  deter  future  Russian  incursions,  and work with host nation defense forces. Each battle group is composed of multinational forces and capabilities. The first three rotations of American units to lead Battle Group Poland were squadrons of 2d Cavalry Regiment, a Germany-based unit equipped with the Stryker armored fighting vehicle. In September 2018, the 2d Squadron, 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Tennessee Army National Guard), assumed responsibility for Battle Group Poland from the 1st Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment. This marked the first rotation of a U.S. armored task force under NATO to Poland's eastern border, and the furthest east American heavy forces traveled in Europe since the end

of the Cold War.  In May 2019, the 3d Squadron, 278th Armored Cavalry  Regiment  (Pennsylvania  and  Tennessee  Army  National Guard), replaced their 2d Squadron counterparts.

Since  FY  2017,  the  Army  has  deployed  a  reinforced  combat aviation brigade from the United States for nine-month rotations in Europe to supplement the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade's operations in  support  of  Operation atlantic  resolve .  In  February  2019,  the Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division, replaced the Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.

## Domestic Operations

During  FY  2019,  Army  forces  deployed  for  relief  and  support operations within the United States and its territories. Army troops from all three components assisted with relief efforts in response to natural disasters that struck the United States, including Hurricanes Michael and Dorian, Super Typhoon Yutu, and California wildfires.

In  October  2018,  the  secretary  of  defense  authorized  the  deployment of 5,200 active duty troops, drawn from all services, to the U.S.-Mexico border in response to a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Army comprised the majority of troops, bolstering the 2,100 National Guard troops assigned to the border since April 2018 as part of Operation guardian support. These forces, under the command and control of U.S. Northern Command and assisting law enforcement officials from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, provided engineering support, such as constructing temporary barricades, medical services, aviation support, and command and control capabilities. The active duty  soldiers  came  from  bases  across  the  United  States-including  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina;  Fort  Campbell,  Kentucky;  Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Riley,  Kansas; Fort Sam Houston, Texas; Fort Stewart, Georgia; and  Joint  Base  Lewis-McChord,  Washington-and  deployed  to the  U.S.-Mexico  border  in  California,  Arizona,  and  Texas.  Their numbers peaked at about 5,800 in mid-November 2018. Initially, the deployment was to last from 30 October to 15 December 2018, but was eventually extended through the end of FY 2020, and new troops  rotated  to  the  border.  By  September  2019,  approximately 2,900  active-duty  and  2,000  National  Guard  troops  remained  on the southwest border supporting civil authorities at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.

## Reserve Components

Organizational Structure

During fiscal year (FY) 2019, the Army National Guard (ARNG) comprised  roughly  41  percent  of  the  Army's  overall  operational force-up from 39 percent in FY 2018. Structurally, the ARNG has thirteen  command  and  control  headquarters:  eight  divisional,  two expeditionary sustainment, and one each for military police, theater sustainment, and air and missile defense. It also has two special forces groups,  one  security  force  assistance  brigade,  one  cyber  brigade, twenty-seven brigade combat teams, forty-two multifunctional support brigades, and fifty-four functional support brigades and groups.

The Army National Guard Directorate, located in Arlington, Virginia, reports  to  the  National  Guard  Bureau  and  develops  and  administers Army National Guard programs. The directorate consists of the Office of the Director, ARNG, and the U.S. Army National Guard Readiness Center, which is a field operating agency of the National Guard Bureau. Additionally, staff from the Office of the Chief, National Guard Bureau, provides support to the Army National Guard Directorate in areas such as public affairs, legislative liaison, and contracting.

The  U.S.  Army  Reserve  is  organized  under  a  single  general officer with staff responsibilities to the Department of the Army as the chief of Army Reserve and command authority over most Army Reserve soldiers  as  the  commander,  U.S.  Army  Reserve  Command. Approximately, 2,000 units are organized into twenty-two functional commands and seven geographic commands-three mission support commands and four readiness divisions-all overseen by U.S. Army Reserve  Command  (USARC).  The  Army  Reserve  provides  nearly 20 percent of the total Army's organized units; more than a quarter of its mobilization base expansion capacity; and roughly 78 percent of its sustainment capabilities, including medical, fuel distribution, logistics, and transportation units.

To enhance its ability to train, equip, and support both individuals and  units,  the  Army  Reserve  in  June  2019  established  each  of  its four  readiness  division  commanders  as  the  'Senior  Geographic Commander'  within  their  designated  geographic  footprint.  Senior

geographic commanders will exercise command authorities that are 'installation-like' within their regions of responsibility, in addition to exercising traditional operational command and control of those units and elements directly assigned to their respective commands. They will serve as the primary point of contact and senior leader responsible for the synchronization of Army Reserve activities within a given region.

In  order  to  support  the  logistical  requirements  of  the  Army's increased presence in Poland and eastern Europe, the Army Reserve activated,  in  September  2019,  the  510th  Support  Group  (a  regional support group), 83d Support Battalion (sustainment support), 319th Military History Detachment, and the 530th and 603d Transportation Detachments (both movement control teams) in Europe. These units serve under the 7th Mission Support Command, a European-based Army Reserve unit that provides critical support capabilities to U.S. Army Europe and the 21st Sustainment Command.

## Mobilization

During FY 2019, the Army National Guard mobilized a total  of  22,050  soldiers  for  active  federal  service  ( Table  8 ). The  Army  Reserve  mobilized  13,502  soldiers  from  674  units. The majority of the troops supported U.S. Central Command operations,  with  most  serving  in  Kuwait  or  Afghanistan.  Army  Reserve

mobilizations  for  U.S.  European  Command  increased  during  FY 2019,  largely  to  support  the  new  defensive  cooperation  agreement with Poland.

## Disaster Relief Operations

The  ARNG  and  Army  Reserve  provided  significant  support for hurricane relief operations and also assisted civil authorities in a variety of other ways. On 10 October 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in western Florida as a Category 5 hurricane. The storm  generated  fierce  winds  and  a  storm  surge  along  the  coast, as  well  as  high  winds  and  rain  inland,  and  left  behind  a  path  of destruction. In its wake, several thousand Florida National Guard members  conducted  search  and  rescue  operations,  distributed supplies,  provided  transportation  and  aviation  support,  assisted with  route  clearance  and  cleanup,  furnished  security  at  shelters, and  completed  other  necessary  tasks.  National  Guard  personnel from nearby states and elsewhere in the country assisted, including Alabama,  New  York,  Ohio,  and  Wisconsin.  National  Guard members  from  Georgia  and  other  states  along  the  east  coast likewise supported state and local authorities when the remnants of Hurricane Michael moved north.

On 25 October, Super Typhoon Yutu struck the islands of Tinian and Saipan in the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana

Islands. The strongest storm to hit any piece of U.S. territory since 1935, the typhoon inflicted extensive damage, destroying homes and businesses,  leveling  trees,  and  causing  widespread  power  outages. In  response,  the  Army  Reserve's  9th  Mission  Support  Command mobilized some 300 soldiers to support relief and recovery operations on Saipan. They helped with debris clearance, distributed supplies, and  assisted  civil  authorities  and  nongovernmental  organization partners with other requirements. Some reservists remained on site for more than a month. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Guam National Guard likewise sent more than 150 soldiers to Saipan  to  assist  in  clearing  debris  and  providing  other  support. Among these soldiers,  heavy  equipment  operators  deployed  with excavators, dump trucks, and other clearing equipment.

Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina,  Virginia,  and  West  Virginia  activated  several  thousand ARNG troops as Hurricane Dorian pushed through the Atlantic Ocean  and  approached  the  U.S.  mainland.  The  soldiers  assisted with the evacuation and securing of coastal areas and helped with other preparations. After the storm passed, they aided search and rescue  and  supply  distribution  efforts,  particularly  along  North Carolina's coast, where the hurricane made landfall as a Category 1 storm on 6 September 2019. Personnel from the Army Reserve's 4th  Sustainment  Command  (Expeditionary)  provided  logistical support  to  military  units  responding  to  the  storm,  coordinating the distribution of supplies and equipment. They supported efforts both in the United States and in the hard-hit Bahamas, where active component forces assisted with recovery operations. Army Reserve Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers also worked with federal and military officials to prepare for recovery operations if needed. These  officers  are  from  the  76th  U.S.  Army  Reserve  Operational Response  Command to the ten Federal  Emergency  Management Agency regions across the United States.

Throughout  the  year,  the  ARNG  supported  civil  authorities in  other  ways  as  well.  Alaska,  California,  Colorado,  Nevada, Oregon, and Washington activated Guard personnel to help cope with  wildfires  in  the  western  United  States.  The  soldiers  directed traffic,  evacuated  families,  provided  logistical  support,  and  flew helicopters equipped with water buckets to assist in fire suppression efforts.  When severe flooding ravaged the Midwest, the shores of Lake Ontario, and other parts of the country, hundreds of Guard members filled and placed sandbags, transported first responders, airdropped hay bales for stranded cattle, and performed additional critical  tasks.  Among  the  ARNG's  other  state  missions,  Kansas

Guard  members  rescued  motorists  stranded  by  winter  storms, and  soldiers  in  Wisconsin,  Louisiana,  and  Oklahoma  assisted with  rescue,  relief,  and  cleanup  efforts  following  severe  summer storms and tornados. The Texas and Louisiana National Guards assisted  in  responding  to  cyber  incidents.  In  Texas,  Guard  cyber experts  helped  with  assessment,  response,  and  recovery  efforts after  a  ransomware  attack  affected  local  municipalities  and  law enforcement  departments.  In  Louisiana,  Guard  members  worked with state experts to bring several school districts back online after malware attacks.

## Southern Border

During FY  2018, the secretary of defense authorized the mobilization  of  up  to  4,000  National  Guard  personnel  to  support the  Department  of  Homeland  Security's  southern  border  security mission through 30 September 2018. In August 2018, the Department of  Defense  authorized  the  continuation  of  this  mission,  Operation guardian support, through the end of FY 2019.

Although California and New Mexico announced in February 2019 that they would soon withdraw most National Guard forces from their borders, more than 2,000 members of the National Guard were  still  deployed  in  Arizona  and  Texas  late  in  the  fiscal  year. These soldiers included some 1,000 members of the Texas National Guard  tasked  with  assisting  federal  immigration  authorities  at ports  of  entry  and  providing  supplemental  staffing  at  immigrant holding facilities.

## Army National Guard State Partnership Program

During FY 2019, the ARNG continued to strengthen its ties with military  forces  around  the  world.  The  State  Partnership  Program, which pairs the National Guards of U.S. states and territories with the  military  and  security  forces  of  other  countries,  is  administered by  the  National  Guard  Bureau.  The  partnerships  enable  ARNG personnel and units to build long-term relationships with the armed forces of U.S. allies and partners by conducting regular military-tomilitary and interagency activities and participating in U.S. and allyled exercises. In FY 2019, Guard personnel and their partner nations conducted command post and field exercises; joined forces to complete construction projects; and carried out subject matter expert exchanges on topics such as military police and peacekeeping operations, civil affairs training, and military engineering best practices. At the end of

the fiscal year, the program included seventy-six partnerships involving one-third of the world's countries and covered all six U.S. geographic combatant commands.

## Readiness

Reserve  component  efforts  to  improve  readiness  and  reduce deployment  timelines  continued  during  FY  2019.  In  keeping  with the  Army's  changing  strategic  concerns,  the  Army  Reserve  in  2016 began shifting its orientation from predictable, rotational, and episodic  readiness  and  employment  to  large-scale  and  short-notice combat operations against peer or near-peer threats. In FY 2019, the Army Reserve continued a program started in 2016, Ready Force X, designed to boost readiness in select units and enable the Reserve to surge capability faster. Rather than building readiness for scheduled overseas rotations with long mobilization lead times, as the Reserve did for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ready Force X builds pool of units with high-demand capabilities that are able to deploy quickly, some with as little as thirty days' notice These units receive priority status for training and equipment. In all, Ready Force X includes about a  third  of  the  force.  Examples  of  high-demand  capabilities  include transportation, cyber, aviation, medical, engineers, and military police.

To better train Ready Force X units and increase overall readiness, the Army Reserve continued its Operation cold steel , which began in 2017. During FY 2019, reservists participated in Operation cold steel III-a  series  of  mounted  and  ground-crew-served  weapons qualification events-at  four installations: Fort Hunter  Liggett, California; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin; and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey.

The Army National Guard's 4.0 initiative similarly seeks to reduce the  amount  of  training  that  Guard  units  need  upon  mobilization. The 4.0 program is designed to increase readiness over time through organizational  and  cultural  changes  and  thereby  strengthen  the ARNG. It will develop units that are led, staffed, equipped, and trained at  sustainable  levels  to  deploy  quickly  for  multiple  contingencies rather than preparing for a specific mission. Army Guard 4.0 employs a  multiyear  training  cycle  that  requires  high-demand  units,  such  as armored and Stryker brigade combat teams and attack-reconnaissance aviation battalions, to conduct as many as sixty-three training days or more per year, rather than the standard thirty-nine, culminating in a combat training center rotation.

In FY 2019, the Army's Associated Units Pilot Program came to a close, and the service elected not to continue the program. The threeyear pilot program, which began in FY 2016, paired select National Guard and Reserve units with Regular Army units to train and build readiness  together,  with  the  intent  of  improving  the  readiness  and responsiveness  of  the  Army  as  a  total  force.  In  FY  2018,  thirteen reserve component units and eleven Regular Army units from company through division level participated in the program.



Management

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics  and  Technology)  continued  developing  an  acquisition data domain (ADD) to create a framework for holistic and effective data management by identifying, collecting, managing, and analyz­ ing  data  throughout  a  program's  lifecycle.  The  ADD  will  collect and link data from a program's inception as an idea through its de­ velopment, production, fielding, sustainment, and demilitarization. It will then link these phases so senior leaders can understand the impacts of accelerating or divesting capabilities being developed. A pilot program for the business management portion of ADD began in FY 2018 and continued in FY 2019. This pilot will help visualize and manage financial data. To save time and funds, the pilot builds on the Air Force's Project Management Resource Tools. This tool operates on the Army network and is already aligned with Office of the Secretary of Defense reporting requirements.

Revisions of several logistics regulations were published in FY 2019: Army Regulation 70-41, Armaments Cooperation , in June 2019; Army Regulation 70-47, Engineering for Transportability Program , in January 2019; Army Regulation 70-75, Survivability of Army Personnel and Material , in April 2019; Army Regulation 700-127, Integrated Product Support , in October 2018; Army Regulation 702-11, Army Quality Program ,  in  November  2018;  and  Army  Regulation 715-30, Secure Environment Contracting , in September 2019.

Army Directive 2019-29, Enabling Readiness and Modernization Through Advanced Manufacturing , issued in September 2019, estab­ lished policy and assigned responsibilities for advanced manufactur­ ing. Advanced manufacturing refers to new ways to manufacture ex­ isting products and the manufacture of new products resulting from advances in information, automation, computation, software, sens­ ing, networking, and materials technologies. Among its provisions, the  directive  makes  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Acquisi­ tion, Logistics and Technology)  responsible for policy related to ad­ vanced manufacturing. That office is also charged with developing,

in coordination with U.S. Army Materiel Command and Army Fu­ tures Command, an advanced manufacturing implementation plan.

## Initiatives

The  ongoing  efforts  to  expand  Army  Pre­positioned  Stocks (APS)  in  Europe  to  a  division  equivalent  force  structure  by  FY 2020 continued. The Army accelerated the growth of a sustainment brigade  equipment  set  in  Belgium  scheduled  for  completion  in  FY 2020.  Likewise,  accelerated  growth  of  medical  unit  equipment  sets provided about 26 percent of equipment on hand. Planning continued for positioning a second armored brigade combat team (BCT) set in Europe by the end of FY 2020 at a temporary site in Germany until facilities in Poland are completed in FY 2021. Rotations of armored BCTs from the United States to Europe during the fiscal year provided the 405th Support Brigade opportunities to practice staging and issuing equipment from APS­2. At the conclusion of the unit's rotation, this equipment was returned to the APS.

In  November  2018,  the  G-4  began  planning  and  coordinating the  Army's  portion  of  the  Department  of  Defense's  support  to  the Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Department  of  Health and  Human  Services'  unaccompanied  alien  children  and  family

member sheltering operations. The concept for this support was the establishment of tent cities, each with 1,000 to 4,000 beds, on military bases in the southwestern part of the United States. The Army did not implement these plans during FY 2019.

A  major  continuing  program  is  the  divestiture  of  excess  and obsolete equipment to preserve resources for modernization. Divestiture  is  accomplished  through  lateral  transfers  of  equipment to maximize readiness across the Army. The G-4 is also working to codify and synchronize policy, processes, and systems to divest in a more expedient manner materiel and capabilities no longer required by the force. In FY 2019, the Army executed 180,000 lateral transfers, shifting assets from locations and units with excess to locations and units in need, as well as executing 547,000 'turn ins.'

In  2003,  the  Army  began  developing  the  Global  Combat  Support System­Army  (GCSS­Army)  using  commercially  available  software  to replace multiple information systems used to order and track supplies, maintain accounts on equipment, and monitor unit maintenance. The GCSS­Army  Wave  1  system,  which  began  fielding  in  February  2013, integrated the databases for warehouse inventory control, as well as supply room, motor pool, and property book offices. In FY 2019, preparations continued  for  fielding  GCSS­Army  Increment  2,  which  includes  a  full suite  of  enterprise­level  business  intelligence  reports  that  will  support strategic management of maintenance objectives. This increment improves the visibility of assets being moved from depots to troops in the field, enabling commanders to better synchronize their flow of resources. The GCSS­Army program management office began transitioning the sustainment of GCSS­Army software from the contractor to the Army Shared Services Center in August 2019. Completion of the transition is expected in March 2020. The Army Shared Services Center will provide enhancements to the system, implement GCSS­Army to additional users, operate the full­service help desk to resolve issues, maintain the system baseline, cybersecurity, and integrate future increments.

The  authorized  stockage  list  (ASL)  includes  items  to  be  kept on hand at the unit level.  During  FY  2018,  all  armored  BCTs  and infantry BCTs converted to a common core ASL list that standardizes supply listings for the majority of unit equipment and enables better interoperability  with  Army  pre­positioned  stocks.  During  FY  2019, a  common  ASL  for  combat  aviation  brigades  was  finalized  and commenced  fielding.  Fielding  to  all  combat  aviation  brigades  is expected to be complete by the end of FY 2021.

In January 2019, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4, collected data demonstrating the lowest customer satisfaction scores during the year  occurred  during  the  peak  season  (15  May-4  July)  for  shipment

of  soldiers'  household  goods  during  a  permanent  change  of  station move. In response to this data, the G-4 established a goal of increasing customer satisfaction scores from 86 percent to 90 percent for the 2019 summer  shipment  season.  Steps  taken  to  achieve  this  goal  included posting moving company customer satisfaction survey scores online to improve transparency; hiring twenty­five additional quality assurance inspectors  for  the  summer;  increasing  moving  company  liability  for household  goods  total  catastrophic  loss  from  $50,000  to  $75,000; increasing liability for a loss of small shipments up to 1,250 pounds from $5,000 to $7,500; and increasing use of containerized shipments in the continental U.S. from 4 percent to 12 percent to reduce loss and damage.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The Future Vertical Lift program will produce aircraft to replace UH-60 Black Hawk, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and OH-58 Kiowa  helicopters.  One  part  of  of  the  program,  the  Future  Long Range  Assault  Aircraft,  will  replace  the  UH-60.  In  July  2019,  the Army Requirements Oversight Council approved the aircraft's draft capabilities development document.

In May 2019, the Army approved a new strategy for accelerating the rapid prototyping and fielding of a variety of directed energy weapons. Later in FY 2019, the Army issued a contract award to accelerate the rapid prototyping and fielding of its first combat­capable laser weapon system. This prototype will deliver a set of fifty­kilowatt lasers on a platoon of four Stryker vehicles in FY 2022. This system is intended to protect BCTs from unmanned aerial systems, rotary­wing aircraft, and rocket, artillery, and mortar fire.

In November 2018, the 3d BCT, 82d Airborne Division, conducted the Army's final Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) at Fort Bliss, Texas.  The  two­week  exercise,  conducted  since  2011,  tested  a  wide variety  of  brigade­level  mission  command  and  intelligence  analysis systems,  concepts,  and  equipment.  In  place  of  NIEs,  the  Army  will continue  to  conduct  annual  Joint  Warfighting  Assessments  (JWAs). Begun in October 2016 as the Army Warfighting Assessment, the JWA is a large­scale joint and multinational exercise intended to test concepts and capabilities at the brigade­level and above. JW A 19 took place from 23  April  to  11  May  2019  at  Yakima  Training  Center  and  Joint  Base Lewis­McChord, Washington. Participants included more than 6,000 soldiers and marines, as well as forces from six partner nations.

One  experiment  at  NIE  was  the  Integrated  Tactical  Network (ITN)  concept  developed  by  Army  Futures  Command's  Network Cross­Functional  Team.  The  ITN  is  the  suite  of  communications

and  networking  hardware  and  software  to  provide  voice  and  data communication capabilities to tactical units in a unified Army network. U.S.  Army  Futures  Command  approved  the  ITN  Modernization Abbreviated - Capability Development Document in May 2019. This requirements  document  does  not  rigidly  define  the  network,  thus enabling evolution over time as the Army identifies new technologies. The Army Acquisition Executive approved a rapid prototyping middle­ tier acquisition for ITN in May 2019. The Army submitted its ITN test and evaluation strategy to Congress in September 2019.

In  FY  2017,  to  support  the european  deterrence  initiative , the  Army  began  an  expedited  installation  and  characterization  of existing  active  protection  system  technologies  for  the  Abrams  tank, the  Bradley  family  of  vehicles,  and  the  Stryker  family  of  vehicles. These systems protect armored fighting vehicles from antitank guided missiles, rocket­propelled grenades, and recoilless rifle threats by using a kinetic 'hard kill' mechanism to intercept and disrupt or defeat the incoming projectile. In FY 2019, for the Abrams system, the Army completed Phase II testing, which included operational testing with a tank platoon and live­fire testing against a ballistic hull and turret tank shell. The evaluation of Phase II testing was not completed by the end of the fiscal year. In August 2018, the Army completed Phase I testing of the Bradley system. The system's tests found an inconsistent capability to intercept threats. The contractor spent FY 2019 working to mitigate these problems; the Army plans to verify this work in Phase II testing scheduled for FY 2021. From December 2018 to April 2019, two  systems  were  tested  for  the  Stryker.  The  tests  showed  neither system was immediately suitable.

In April 2019, developmental testing began on the Army Integrated  Air  and  Missile  Defense  system.  It  is  a  command  and control system integrating sensors, weapons, and a common mission command  interface  across  an  integrated  fire  control  network.  The Army conducted a missile flight test in August 2019 that demonstrated the system's capability to detect, track, and intercept a subscale target at a distance greater than a Patriot system could achieve on its own.

In  November  2018,  the  Army  conducted  an  initial  operational test and evaluation of the Command Post Computing Environment (CPCE) as part of NIE 18.2. The Army began this program in FY 2016.  It  is  a  server­based  software  system  that  provides  mission command applications for commanders and staff from battalion to corps  echelons.  The  CPCE  uses  general  purpose  client  computers located  within  tactical  operations  centers.  Test  results  found  the system not operationally effective, not operationally suitable, and not survivable  in  a  cyber­contested  environment.  After  several  iterative

test­learn­fix­test cycles, an acquisition decision memorandum in July 2019 authorized conditional full deployment of CPCE to two divisions, two brigades, and units participating in exercise deFender 2020. The memorandum established conditions to allow further fielding of the system upon demonstration of key deficiencies. The Army plans to conduct  a  developmental  test  early  in  FY  2020  to  verify  fixes  and assess software enhancements.

In May 2019, the Army Acquisition Executive approved the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program to enter full­rate production. The JLTV, a family of tactical wheeled vehicles and companion trailers, is  replacing  the  High  Mobility  Multipurpose  Wheeled  Vehicles.  It offers better armor protection while still being transportable in C-130 aircraft and externally slung from a CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The JLTV also has improved mobility and a V­shaped hull to deflect the blast of explosions away from the crew cabin. In the second quarter of FY 2019, the 1st BCT, 3d Infantry Division, was the first unit to receive the JLTV . In the fourth quarter of FY 2019, the Army began fielding the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle­Binocular. It has improved capabilities in limited visibility conditions. In addition, it has higher­

resolution stereoscopic displays, which enable faster target recognition by making it easier to identify targets from background.

Fielding  of  the  M32A1  handheld  mortar  ballistic  computersfeaturing  a  tactical  modem  and  an  embedded  global  positioning system-began  in  FY  2019.  Crews  can  receive  digital  call­for­fire messages and calculate ballistic solutions for all three mortar calibers used by the Army. The M32A1 is smaller and lighter than previously fielded ballistic computers, and the interface is streamlined to make it easier to use.

The Armored Multipurpose Vehicle (AMPV) will replace the M113 armored personnel carrier in multiple mission roles, including general purpose transport, command and control, mortar carrier, and medevac. After completion of the limited user test at the end of FY 2018, the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council, in December 2018, approved low­ rate initial production for the program. The Army expects to equip its first unit with AMPVs in 2021.

The Soldier Protection System is the next generation of modular body  armor.  The  major  advance  of  this  new  armor  over  previous protective gear is protection against threats at a reduced weight. Its subsystems  are  designed  to  protect  a  soldier's  head,  eyes,  and  neck region; the vital torso and upper torso areas, as well as the extremities; and the pelvic region. Soldiers can configure the various components to provide different tiers of protection depending on the threat and the mission.  The  Army approved full­rate production of the Integrated Head Protection System in October 2018. Testing of new lighter weight vital torso protection design from multiple vendors began during the fiscal year.

Full rate production was approved for the Improved Environmental Control Unit, which will produce updated systems providing critical cooling to vital military electronic and support systems. The new unit retains the same size and shape as older models, but is 10 to 25 percent lighter  and  is  more  energy  efficient.  Improved  electronics,  such  as  a 'soft  start'  to  limit  voltage  drops  on  startup,  as  well  as  automatic safety controls, are also integrated to increase reliability.

The Joint  Assault  Bridge  is  a  M1A1  Abrams  tank  chassis  with M1A2 Abrams heavy suspension and a contractor designed integrated hydraulic bridge launch mechanism. The bridge is designed to carry even  the  heaviest  tanks  over  gaps  of  eighteen  meters,  significantly improving the tactical mobility of armor and mechanized units. The Army conducted an initial  operational  test  and  evaluation  in  April 2019 using the 2d BCT, 1st Armored Division, at Fort Bliss, Texas. Test events  included  combined  arms  and  in­stride  breaching  operations. Poor system reliability limited availability of vehicles during the testing.

Joint Assault Bridge



After correcting the identified deficiencies, a second initial operational test and evaluation will be conducted in FY 2020.

The Army continued to develop capabilities in additive manufacturing. The Rock Island Arsenal for the Joint Manufacturing and  Technology  Center's  Center  of  Excellence  for  Advanced  and Additive Manufacturing,  established in FY  2018,  began  initial operations in FY 2019. It will serve as the Army's hub for collaboration with industry, academia, and other Department of Defense partners to  implement  additive  manufacturing  best  practices.  The  center  is scheduled to reach full operational capability in 2021.

## Foreign Military Sales

The  Army's  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  program  is  part  of the  overall  U.S.  Defense  Security  Assistance  program,  and  it  is responsible for transferring defense materials and services to foreign countries  and  international  organizations.  The  FMS  program  is a  significant  element  of  U.S.  foreign  policy  and  helps  strengthen bilateral  defense  relationships  and  improve  interoperability  between U.S. forces and foreign partners. In September 2019, the sale of eight AH-6i light attack helicopters was approved for sale to Thailand, with a  total  program  cost  of  $400  million.  The  Czech  Republic  received approval to buy twelve UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for roughly $800 million. Egypt was approved to purchase ten AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, valued at $1 billion. The United Kingdom received

approval to purchase sixteen CH-47 Chinook helicopters in a package valued at $3.5 billion.

Thailand  was  also  approved  to  purchase  sixty  Stryker  combat vehicles,  worth  an  estimated  $175  million.  Morocco  was  approved to  purchase  2,400  TOW  (Tube­launched,  Optically  tracked,  Wire­ guided) missiles for a total program cost of more than $750 million. The government of Lithuania approved the purchase of five hundred JLTVs,  with  a  total  cost  of  $170.6  million.  The  State  Department approved the sale of 108 M1A2 tanks to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, with the total package cost amounting to  roughly  $2  billion.  Morocco  was  approved  for  Abrams  tank enhancements valued at $1.259 billion.

Bahrain was approved to purchase Patriot air defense missiles and support equipment valued at more than $2.4 billion. The United Arab Emirates also was approved to purchase Patriot missiles, with a large request for 452 PAC­3 missiles, valued at more than $2.7 billion. Turkey was approved for a large package of missiles and related equipment for $3.5 billion. Germany was also approved to purchase Patriot missiles.

## 7 Support Services

## Installations

An assessment of infrastructure on Army installations, including housing  and  energy  and  water  systems,  found  that  25  percent  of facilities are in poor or failing condition. The estimated cost to restore these facilities is $11.3 billion.

The  Office  of  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Installations, Energy and Environment) collected complete data on the security of Army installations' energy and water systems. The Army is finalizing energy and water plans for twenty-one strategic installations to ensure energy and water are available for critical missions and to lower costs by  increasing  conservation  and  efficiency.  One  hundred  and  thirtyone  installations  completed  assessments  of  their  energy  and  water systems, allowing installation management staff to identify areas for improvement.

The Army conducted energy resilience readiness exercises at several installations in FY 2019. This exercise is the planned, simultaneous disconnection from utility power of an entire installation, or a large portion  of  it,  to  evaluate  whether  the  installation's  backup  power generation can run at full operational load for an extended period of time. The April 2019 exercise at Fort Bragg took place concurrently with  an  emergency  deployment  readiness  exercise  by  the  XVIII Airborne Corps' global response force to test deployment readiness during a utility power interruption.

The  Office  of  Energy  Initiatives  continued  to  leverage  private capital  to  modernize  and  diversify  the  Army's  energy  supplies.  At the end of FY 2019, the office's project pipeline contained thirty-one developments  at  twenty-two  Army  installations.  Eighteen  of  these will  provide  'islandable'  capabilities,  maintaining  power  for  critical missions at the site  in  the  event  of  a  wider  grid  outage.  The  eleven operational projects have a total production capability of more than 325 megawatts.

Installation  management  staff  assessed  infrastructure  on  Army installations,  including  housing  and  energy  and  water  systems,  and reported 25 percent of facilities are in poor or failing condition. Staff estimated that $11.3 billion is needed to restore these facilities. The

H

Army saved millions of dollars by updating its European Infrastructure Consolidation Business Plan, which directs the closure of certain Army sites  in  Europe.  Review-related  delays  impacted  several  actions  of this business plan. Installation management staff worked with Army information managers and U.S. Army Cyber Command on inventory and  evaluation  of  cyber  facilities  and  cybersecurity  systems.  Teams of Ohio National Guard and Washington National Guard members participated  in  a  pilot  program  to  enhance  cybersecurity  of  critical infrastructure, such as energy, telecommunications, and water systems that serve local military installations. The teams worked with private companies to assess and mitigate risks. In May, the New York State Department of Transportation began working to add turning lanes and a slip ramp to ease traffic congestion at a highway intersection near Fort Drum.

## Housing

The  Residential  Communities  Initiative  (RCI)  is  the  Army's partnership with private companies to build and maintain almost all on-post family housing. During FY 2019, these companies continued to fail to provide required maintenance and repair services, leaving many  houses  damaged  by  mold  in  particular,  as  well  as  by  water leaks  and  vermin  infestations.  Soldiers  and  their  families  reported illnesses caused by these failures. They also reported the companies did not respond effectively, and in some instances retaliated against those reporting.

In February and March 2019, the Office of The Inspector General conducted an inspection of the RCI. The inspector general confirmed these failures and the retaliation against soldiers and their families. The inspection issued several findings: RCI implemented agreements with favored contractors over the Army; policies for RCI housing created confusion  over  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities;  and  garrison commanders and staff received  insufficient  training  to  oversee  RCI contractors; among other issues. The inspector general made twenty recommendations to address these findings.

The deputy chief of staff, G  -9, stood up a team to manage and coordinate the Army's response. In February 2019, the Army launched its action plan to address housing issues. Garrison commanders tracked emergency  work  orders  on  a  daily  basis  to  ensure  swift  resolution. In  coordination  with  officials  of  private  housing  companies,  senior commanders  and  Army  housing  offices  conducted  town  halls  with soldiers  and  their  families  to  hear  their  housing  concerns.  Garrison leaders visited housing and inspected all barracks to identify

substandard conditions and maintenance deficiencies, and they developed plans to remediate these deficiencies. When serious issues could  not  be  immediately  remediated,  housing  managers  relocated residents  to  safe  temporary  quarters.  Federal  preservation  officials are working with the Army to balance preservation needs with health, safety, and quality issues in historic housing built between 1919 and 1940.

Army installation management staff created new guidelines and incentive fees for companies to address housing issues. After finding that more than $1 billion will be needed to address environmental risks primarily  associated  with  23,000  older  homes,  the  Army  requested companies  increase  funding  to  replace  these  homes.  Installation management officials met with RCI contractors to discuss issues such as renter's insurance, residents' rights, leases, incentive fees, property management, customer service, and maintenance. These contractors agreed to invest $500 million in housing improvements.

The Office of Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment) worked with its counterparts in the other military departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense on a military housing privatization initiative tenant bill of rights. This document will promise soldiers and their families quality housing and fair treatment from the contractors that own and operate RCI properties. The secretary of defense is expected to sign the bill of rights in FY 2020.

## Public Affairs

Throughout the fiscal year, the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs stressed six key themes and messages: the Army's readiness for immediate combat, modernization to make soldiers and units more lethal, reform to ensure responsible spending and use of resources, people as the Army's greatest asset, the importance of Army values, and allies and partners. In April 2019, the office issued guidance regarding the Army outreach program. It provided policies and resources for outreach activities and encouraged Army units to host community events such as open houses at installations, aerial demonstrations, and other military demonstrations; to attend local military support committee meetings; and to facilitate civic groups' visits to the Pentagon.

The  commemoration  of  the  seventy-fifth  anniversary  of  the Normandy invasion in June 1944 was a major public affairs event during  the  fiscal  year.  The  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  Public  Affairs Office  provided  relevant  information  to  the  media,  collected  and distributed  images,  and  produced  social  media  content.  The  office also facilitated participation by major media organizations in D-Day

H

commemorations  and  coordinated  with  other  U.S.  government agencies and with French officials.

To better prepare Army public affairs soldiers to operate in the modern media environment,  in  FY  2019,  the  military  occupational specialties for broadcast and print journalists merged into a new mass communication specialty. Soldiers in the grade of staff sergeant and below with one of the older specialties  must  complete  the  required training and validation by the end of FY 2021 to be fully qualified as  a  mass  communications  specialist.  Persons  enlisting  for  the  new specialty will attend the Basic Public Affairs Specialist course followed by the Electronic Journalism course.

Army Reserve soldiers participate in mass communications specialist military occupational specialty conversion training at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, 12 August 2019.



## Legislative Liaison

The Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison (OCLL) manages the Army's relations and communications with Congress. It provides information about the Army to members of Congress and their staff, prepares Army personnel for congressional hearings and engagements, and  assists  senior  Army  officials  during  their  Senate  confirmation process. OCLL advises senior Army leaders and staff about legislative affairs affecting the service.

The  office  informed  members  of  Congress  about  the  Army's programs and goals by hosting a series of events and briefings for 109 congressional  delegations  and  303  congressional  staff  delegations.

It  also  facilitated  engagements  between  soldiers  and  congressional representatives. For example, in June and July 2019, soldiers of the 3d Cavalry Regiment participated in office calls with congressional leaders to discuss the regiment's activities while deployed to Kuwait, Iraq, and Syria. In August 2019, OCLL hosted a visit by six congressional staff members to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. They participated in basic combat training activities such as physical training and marksmanship training to learn what it takes to become a soldier.

The  year  2019  marked  the  tenth  anniversary  of  the  inclusion of  senior  noncommissioned  officers  in  the  Army  Congressional Fellowship Program. The program allows soldiers and Army civilians to pursue a master's degree in legislative affairs, serve on the staff of a member of Congress, and then to serve in an Army office dealing with  legislative  affairs.  The  program  will  expand  from  two  to  three noncommissioned officer fellows in 2020.

## Chaplain Corps

In  fiscal year  2019,  the  Chaplain  Corps  addressed  years  of recruiting shortages by adding the largest number of new chaplains in

H

more than a decade, including 110 chaplains to the Regular Army, 48 chaplains to the Army National Guard, and 91 chaplains to the Army Reserve. The Corps also accepted 163 chaplain candidates (chaplains in training) for the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve.

The Office of the Chief of Chaplains moved some functions from the Pentagon to a new Chaplain Corps Religious Support Operations Center at the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The Religious Support Operations Center coordinates religious services and religious education across the Army. The Office of the Chief of Chaplains recommended colonels be appointed as command chaplains to advise commanding generals, replacing lieutenant colonels, to  improve  religious  services  and  advice  to  senior  leaders.  The  office added data on chaplains into the Total Office Personnel Management Information  System  for  more  efficient  tracking  and  assignment  of chaplains. The Chaplain Corps revived its professional journal, The U.S. Army Chaplain Corps Journal , last published in 2015.

## Safety

During FY 2019, the Army recorded 117 accident-related fatalities: 26 on duty and 91 off duty-an increase of five fatalities from FY 2018.  Class  A  accidents  increased  from  143  in  FY  2018  to  149  in FY 2019. Twelve of these accidents involved Army aircraft. Class A mishaps  are  accidents  in  which  the  resulting  total  cost  of  property damage is $2 million or more; an Army aircraft is destroyed, missing, or  abandoned;  or  an  injury  results  in  a  fatality  or  permanent  total disability.

In an attempt to reduce Army fatalities, the U.S. Army Combat Readiness  Center  created  several  safety  campaigns  and  briefings. Among these was the 2019 Off-Duty Safety Awareness Presentation emphasizing  the  consequences  of  risky  behaviors.  As  part  of  the campaign, the center created and distributed briefing kits for organization  leaders  including  videos,  slides, and  speaker  notes highlighting hazards associated with routine off-duty activities. It also launched  seasonal  safety  campaigns  to  provide  accident  prevention tips related to specific winter and summer hazards.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) operates 122 main stores, 165 military clothing stores, 589 convenience stores, and 77 movie theaters. It operates a Web site for online purchases. More than 1,700 fast food facilities operate under license in AAFES facilities.

An AAFES Mobile Field Exchange deployed to Guyana for the new Horizons 2019 exercise.



The Exchange Credit Program provides the military community with low-interest Military Star credit cards. All Exchange earnings support military community programs such as child and youth services, Armed Forces Recreation Centers, and new or renovated stores. The sale of goods and services funds 97 percent of the AAFES operating budget, and AAFES uses most of the remaining 3 percent from appropriated funds to transport goods to its facilities overseas.

In  November  2018,  AAFES  launched  a  Military  Star  Mobile software  app  allowing  Military  Star  credit  card  users  to  access  their accounts and make payments. In January 2019, it joined the exchange services of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Defense Commissary Agency, to  form  a  joint  buying  alliance  which  uses  the combined buying power of these organizations to save money on bulk purchases  of  goods  for  retail  sale.  The  alliance  began  its  combined purchases with products such as electronics, health and beauty items. Through the BE FIT program, AAFES continued to increase the healthy

food options, such as fresh fruit, nuts, tuna, protein bars, and bottled water, available from its vendors, restaurants, and vending machines.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

In  January  2019,  the  Army  Family  and  Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation (MWR) program joined other U.S. armed services' MWR programs to launch American Forces Travel. It is a Web site run by a commercial company offering discounts and travel deals on hotels, flights, rental cars, vacation packages, and cruises to military service members and their families, to military retirees, and to Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees serving outside the United States. Bookings  through  the  Web  site  generate  commissions  that  support MWR programs.

A February 2019 Army Directive on Army child care and child development  programs  required  spaces  in  these  programs  currently used by children of contractors, military retirees, or non-DoD federal employees be vacated after thirty days' notice when these spaces are needed for children in priority categories: children of single active duty military personnel or DoD civilian employees; of active duty military personnel  or  DoD  employees  with  a  working  spouse  or  a  spouse actively seeking employment; or of active duty military personnel with a spouse enrolled in college.

The MWR program hosted the 34th Army Ten-Miler road race on 7 October 2018 in Washington, D.C. More than 35,000 runners registered for the race, generating proceeds for Army MWR programs. On the same date, MWR held dozens of ten-mile 'shadow runs' on or near Army installations around the world, including thirteen overseas locations. MWR's annual 'Young Lives, BIG Stories' Contest in April 2019 encouraged children of soldiers in six different age categories to submit artwork or essays about their lives as military family members. In partnership with AAFES, the National Guard, and a commercial gaming company, MWR hosted several multiplayer video game events and tournaments at installations.

## Special Functions

Surgeon General

In FY 2019, the Army Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) and Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) experienced major organizational changes. In the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2017 and 2019, Congress directed the military services to eliminate what it saw as duplicated services and establish a single, integrated military healthcare system by transferring control of medical treatment facilities (MTFs) to the Defense Health Agency (DHA). The National Defense Authorization Act of 2019 set out a phased approach for the transition, which began on 1 October 2018 for the Army with Womack Army Medical Center,  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina.  In  FY  2019,  phase  one  saw  six MTFs in the eastern United States (including Womack) transferred to the DHA, joining two facilities already administered by the agencyWalter Reed National Military Medical Center and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital. Facilities in the western United States are scheduled for transfer in 2020, with overseas MTFs by the end of 2021.

The National Defense Authorization Act 2019 revised the surgeon general's  statutory  duties  to  focus  on  medical  readiness  and  Army medical  personnel's  clinical  training  and  professional  development. The surgeon general remained the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff on all health and medical matters.

During  FY  2019,  OTSG  developed  several  courses  of  action for  reorganizing  Army  medicine  in  response  to  the  congressionally mandated  changes  in  military  health  care.  Initially,  in  November 2019, the secretary of the Army approved a reorganization plan. The plan included the following steps: The functions and responsibilities in the MEDCOM staff and the regional health commands will move to mission-tailored medical  readiness directorates established in the  functional  Army  commands  and  the  Army  service  component commands.  The  regional  health  commands  and  MEDCOM  will then be disestablished. A U.S. Army Provisional Medical Readiness Command will be established to manage the transition of MTFs and specified  health  care  delivery  functions  from  MEDCOM  and  the

Lt. Gen. Nadja Y. West, The Surgeon General, at Fort Campbell's Rascon School of Combat Medicine, 30 October 2018



regional health commands to DHA, then be disestablished once the process is completed.

However, in April 2019, DHA scrapped its plan for completing the transfer of MTFs because it required the agency to achieve too much too fast while delaying full transition and the realization of anticipated savings  until  the  end  of  FY  2021.  As  DHA  developed  a  successor plan, MEDCOM and the regional medical commands determined the effort to stand down as rapidly as envisaged by the OTSG plan is not possible since these commands must provide direct support to DHA at least through the end of FY 2021. Therefore, by the end of FY 2019 the approved OTSG plan was not implemented.

In FY 2019, the Army conducted a risk-based analysis looking at converting  military  MTF  authorizations  to  civilian  authorizations  to place greater emphasis on modernization priorities. In November 2018, the  Army  realigned  6,935  low-  and  medium-risk  medical  and  dental authorizations with higher-priority requirements in the Army. The cuts (2,067 officers  and  4,868  enlisted)  spread  across  four  fiscal  years  and include 1,585 'unencumbered,' or unoccupied, enlisted positions. On 6  December 2018, Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) directed  the  reallocation  of  1,685  Professional  Officer  Filler  System (PROFIS) military medical authorizations from the Generating Force to the Operating Force. Formerly, MEDCOM tables of distribution and

allowances assigned PROFIS personnel authorizations in MTFs, labs, and clinics. They filled requirements in modified table of organization and  equipment  (MTOE)  units  only  for  training  and  deployment. Permanently  assigned  to  MTOE  units,  these  soldiers  concurrently maintained places of duty in MTFs to maintain their clinical skills.

The OTSG worked to decrease the stigma associated with behavioral healthcare. By November 2018, sixty-one embedded behavioral health teams supported operational units. Teams are composed of licensed clinical  social  workers,  psychologists,  psychiatric  nurse  practitioners, nurse case managers, and other behavioral healthcare professionals. They are a mix of Regular Army soldiers, civilian employees, and contract providers. Through July 2019, the Army facilitated 19,480 Tele-Behavioral Health encounters, part of the wider initiative to deliver healthcare remotely to patients around the world.

The General Officer-Readiness Executive Health program, which achieved initial operating capability in February 2018 at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, reached full operational capability  in  January  2019.  The  program's  purpose  is  to  develop wellness, resiliency, and health programs as part of the chief of staff's General Officer Readiness program. By September 2019, 219 general officers and 147 spouses attended the program at Brooke Army Medical Center. Virtual followup visits occur quarterly after a general officer's initial  visit.  Face-to-face  followups  are  required  upon  promotion, every three years, or as needed.

## Army Audit Agency

The  Army  Audit  Agency  examines  all  Army  operations  and programs. About sixty employees are based at the agency's operations center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and the Pentagon. The rest are divided between sixteen field offices-thirteen in the continental United States and one each in Germany, Hawaii, and the Republic of Korea. During the  fiscal  year,  the  agency  continued  to  implement  its  FY  2017/21 strategic  plan  and  created  several  process  action  teams  to  work  on specific initiatives. These initiatives include on-the-job training, coaching, and mentoring programs to ensure staff develop necessary auditing skills. The agency also launched a strategic communications initiative to provide staff and leadership with information about policy changes and upcoming events.

The Army Internal Audit Plan for FY 2019 addressed significant risks to the service and its top priorities-readiness, modernization, reform and audit remediation, and best business practices. The agency conducted  an  audit  to  determine  if  the  Army  was  complying  with

acquisition reform initiatives. It also audited the resources required to support rotary-wing flight operations in the Army National Guard. In FY 2019, the agency published 116 reports with more than $784 million in potential monetary benefits. It made almost 400 recommendations to improve Army operations.

## Office of Army Cemeteries

In July 2019, the Army National Military Cemeteries (ANMC) was redesignated as the Office of Army Cemeteries (OAC). Its executive director remained the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army on all matters related to Army cemeteries. The OAC provides oversight and expertise for all Army cemeteries. The United States has fortyone Army cemeteries, of which Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) is the most prominent, with 3.7 million visitors in FY 2019. The OAC employed six civilians and ten military personnel in FY 2019. ANC's civilian strength was 187 employees, with a uniformed strength of 31 military personnel.

For the third year in a row, the OAC led the effort to disinter the remains of Native American children who died during the nineteenth century  while  attending  the  United  States  Indian  Industrial  School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  In  July  2019,  OAC  staff  oversaw  the disinterment of the remains of six Native American children from the Carlisle Barracks post cemetery. Four children are from the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, one child is from the Omaha Nation, and one child is from Modoc Nation. The closest living relative of each child requested  the  remains  be  transferred  for  reinterment  in  their  home regions.

Work continued on making Army cemeteries more accessible to the  public.  During  FY  2019,  the  OAC  collected  aerial  imagery  and GIS  (Geographic  Information  Systems)  data  for  four  cemeteries, which will  be  used  to  create  and  update  the  OAC  Mapper  and  the OAC Gravesite Explorer. These systems, once fielded, will allow the public to search Army cemeteries by name and location in order to find specific gravesites, with a picture of the headstone, an aerial map, and basic data about the deceased.

Proper care and honor for veterans and their families remained ANC's  primary mission. It conducted 6,440 burials, including two  interments  at  the  United  States  Soldiers'  and  Airmen's  Home National Cemetery. In addition to burial services, ANC conducted 35 full honor and 3,150 public wreath ceremonies, along with 260 other events-including  the  traditional  Memorial  Day  and  Veteran's  Day commemorations.

To preserve ANC as an active burial ground for the next 150 years, the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  2019  included  a  provision directing the secretary of the Army, in consultation with the secretary of defense, to prescribe revised criteria for interment and inurnment. The  secretary  of  the  Army  announced  the  proposed  revisions  in September 2019. In accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, the Army then began the public comment process, which will be completed in FY 2020.

## Civil Works

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil works program is responsible for a variety of water resource operations, including flood controls  and  storm  damage  reduction,  commercial  navigation  projects, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The Corps of Engineers maintains more than 700 dams, 12,000 miles of waterways, 240 locks, and 2,200 levee systems. During the fiscal year, work continued on several coastal  and  riverine  flood  projects,  including  in  the  Natomas  Basin  near Sacramento, California, and on the Chickamauga Lock Replacement Project on the Tennessee River, near Chattanooga. The Corps of Engineers also continued dam safety works at Isabella Lake, California, and seepage control upgrades on the Herbert Hoover Dike in south Florida, among others. In September 2019, work began on deepening  the  inner  harbor  of  Savannah,  Georgia.  This  endeavor initiated the final construction phase of the twenty-year effort to deepen the United States' third-busiest container port. These harbor works are estimated to bring a net increase of $282 million per year to the U.S. economy-or $7.30 in benefits for every dollar spent. Similar harbor improvement projects continued in Jacksonville, Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; and Boston, Massachusetts.

In July 2019, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported the Corps of Engineers did not regularly monitor how long it takes to finalize construction contract changes, limiting management's ability to  identify  and  respond  to  problems.  It  recommended  the  Chief  of Engineers develop a strategy to expand on existing data and systems to routinely collect information on and monitor the time frames for finalizing  construction  contract  changes  at  the  headquarters  level. The assistant secretary of the Army (civil works) concurred with the finding and the recommendation.

The  Corps  of  Engineers  responded  to  three  hurricanes  in  FY 2019, most notably Hurricane Dorian. As a Category 5, the storm devastated the Bahamas and brought significant rainfall to Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The hurricane ultimately made landfall in

the United States as a Category 1 at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on  6  September.  After  the  hurricane,  the  Corps  of  Engineers received missions from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to  provide  subject  matter  expertise  on  debris  and  infrastructure assessments  and  temporary  roof  planning  in  Florida.  Working  in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, it deployed 220 personnel to affected areas.

## Environmental Protection

In FY 2019, the Army continued progress toward achieving the Department of Defense's goal of 'response complete' status (the last stage in the environmental restoration process) at 95 percent of its Base Realignment and Closure sites by the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2019, that rate was 91 percent. Progress was hampered by the Army's efforts to decontaminate sites identified as containing perfluorooctane sulfonic and perfluorooctanoic acid-two chemicals historically used in  fire-retardant foams. By September 2019, this contamination was identified  at  108  Regular  Army,  Army  National  Guard,  and  Army Reserve sites. In July 2019, the secretary of defense established a task force to prepare a coordinated and holistic Department of Defensewide  approach  to  proactively  address  this  contamination.  The  task force's report is expected by January 2020.

## Chemical Weapons Demilitarization

The  chemical  weapons  demilitarization  program's  mission  is  to eliminate  chemical  warfare  materiel  in  accordance  with  obligations specified in the Chemical  Weapons  Convention.  The  remaining stockpiles of this materiel are at the Pueblo  Chemical  Depot, Colorado, and the Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky. During FY 2019,  the  program  continued  destruction  operations  at  the  Pueblo Chemical  Agent-Destruction  Pilot Plant and  began  destruction operations  at  the  Blue  Grass  Chemical  Agent-Destruction  Pilot Plant static detonation chamber. The Blue Grass Army Depot main plant  continued  preparations  for  nerve  agent  projectile  destruction operations, expected to begin in FY 2020.

## Legal

In FY 2019, approximately 1,851 judge advocates served on active duty, 2,723 served in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, and 728 served as civilian attorneys subject to the qualifying authority of  The  Judge  Advocate  General.  Judge  Advocate  General's  Corps (JAGC) personnel supported more than 600 legal offices and deployed task  forces  in  more  than  thirty  countries.  The  FY  2019  attorney population included 133 African Americans, 67 Hispanics, 102 Asians, 1 Native American, and 521 women.

During FY 2019, the JAGC implemented the Military Justice Act of 2016. The act directed significant changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), making structural alterations that aligned

the courts-martial process more closely with those of federal district courts.  The  Judge  Advocate  General  also  directed  implementation of  the  Military  Justice  Redesign  (MJR).  The  MJR  is  based  on recognition that the trial counsel position historically performed two distinct roles-command adviser and litigator. Consequently, the MJR separated  these  roles  into  two  separate  positions:  trial  counsel  who litigate cases referred to court-martial and military justice advisers who advise commanders on their military justice mission. This separation of duties is intended to produce greater expertise both in litigation and in command advice.

At the end of FY 2019, the Army had 437 pending courts-martial cases, with 158 referred for trial by courts-martial, and the remainder pending disposition. Tables 9 through 14 present data on cases completed in FY 2019.

## Historical Activities

In January 2019, the U.S. Army War College published The U.S. Army in the Iraq War . Eventually, the U.S. Army Center of Military History  will  produce  comprehensive  official  history  of  the  Army in this war. Understanding that former Chief of Staff of the Army General Raymond T. Odierno commissioned this study in 2013, the study's purpose was to collect and preserve key lessons, insights, and innovations from the war. It focused on the operational level of war, mainly  from  the  perspective  of  the  theater  command  in  Baghdad and the operational commands immediately subordinate to it. It also traced many of the decisions made at these levels to the tactical level to illuminate how strategic and operational intent translated into changes on the battlefield.  The  study  assessed  the  impact  of  changes  to  the institutional  army,  such  as  modularization  and  transformation,  on operations in Iraq. Finally, it explored the assumptions underpinning the campaign in Iraq at various times and assessed their validity.

During FY 2019, the Army concluded its commemoration effort for  the  World  War  I  centennial.  This  program  provided  historical content  to  Army  personnel  and  American  citizens  through  the creation  of  historical  products  detailing  the  war,  the  planning  and

execution of commemoration events, and a social media campaign. In  2016,  HQDA  designated  the  U.S.  Army  Center  of  Military History  as  the  office  of  primary  responsibility  for  the  centennial commemoration. The Center coordinated several  lines  of  effort  for the commemoration. During a three-year period, it produced twentyseven new and reprinted publications about the war. In early 2017, it launched a Web site dedicated to the centennial. Using a contractor, it developed a digital curriculum for ninth- to twelfth-grade audiences and posted these lesson plans on the centennial Web site. The Center identified Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve units with lineage and campaign credit from the war. It then assisted those units that chose to hold their own commemoration events. The Army,  in  coordination  with  host  nations  and  with  the  U.S.  Army Center of Military History as the lead agency, participated in a series of commemoration activities in Europe.

## 9 Conclusion

At the beginning of FY 2019, the service released the Army Strategy to  articulate  how  it  will  achieve  the  Army  Vision  established  in  the previous year. During FY 2019, the service continued its efforts to meet the central challenge of the Army Vision: how to use finite resources to remain ready for operations now, while simultaneously modernizing and preparing for a different future operating environment.

Soldiers  are  the  bedrock  of  the  Army.  In  FY  2019,  the  Army devoted more resources to its recruiting efforts and reversed almost all the accession shortfalls from the previous year. Use of the talent management concept was expanded, most notably with the Battalion Commander  Assessment  Program  and  revisions  to  the  enlisted centralized promotion board processes. For years, the Army's failure to properly supervise the Residential Communities Initiative harmed soldiers and their families. In FY 2019, the service began taking steps to ensure participating companies provided required maintenance and repair services.

The  Army  Reform  Initiative  continued  to  realign  organizations and  push  authorities  and  responsibilities  down  to  the  lowest  level capable of exercising them. The major changes to military medicinemandated by Congress-continued during FY 2019, but at a slower pace, as it became clear that existing Army medical organizations must remain in direct support of the Defense Health Agency for longer than anticipated.

Prioritizing readiness and modernization coexisted with a continuing high demand  for Army  forces to conduct combat operations, provide deterrence, test new concepts, maintain ties with other  armies,  support  domestic  disaster  relief,  and  border  security operations. Combat operations continued to kill and wound soldiers. Unit  readiness  improved  and  steps  were  taken  to  ensure  this  trend line  remained  in  an  upward  direction  for  all  three  components. The  activation  of  the  security  force  assistance  brigades  continued, permitting brigade combat teams to focus on combined arms training while at the same time sustaining irregular warfare competency and meeting the demand from combatant commands for assisting partner

nations  in  developing  their  security  force  capabilities.  The  Army continued to develop and test its multidomain operations concepts.

Although the beginning of FY 2019 interrupted the long-running trend of entering a fiscal year operating on a continuing resolution instead of an approved budget, that trend resumed at the end of FY 2019. The Army began FY 2020 under a continuing resolution, set to expire on 21 November 2019, which provided funding allocations pegged  to  FY  2019  enacted  levels.  As  usual,  operating  under  a continuing  resolution  placed  restrictions  on  new  starts,  expansion of  ongoing  programs,  production  rate  increases,  and  the  ability  to reprogram funds. The uncertainty of funding levels created challenges in supporting the Army's readiness and modernization priorities for leaders at all levels.
