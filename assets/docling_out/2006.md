## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2006

## Introduction

During fiscal year (FY) 2006, the Army' s primary responsibility was to support ongoing coalition efforts in the Global War on Terrorism. The nation' s priority of operations remained Afghanistan and Iraq in the U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility. In the continental United States, Army support for homeland security, Operation Noble eagle , continued to  decline  significantly  from  its  peak  just  after  the  terrorist  attack  in 2001. Although eight thousand soldiers continued to serve in homeland security functions in 2006, the relaxed domestic security threat permitted the virtual elimination of reserve-component soldiers providing security at airports and other key sites vulnerable to terrorist attack. Instead, both active- and reserve-component soldiers focused their efforts on preparing for deployments overseas in ongoing operations in Central Asia.

Because of the Global War on Terrorism, the Army' s budget increased, ending more than a decade-long trend in budget decreases. The institutional costs attendant to supporting two contingency operations alone drove an increase in budget authority. This increase came in two discrete budget categories: the Army' s annual budget appropriations and the supplemental appropriations  to  specifically  fund  operations.  The  active  Army  also obtained approval for a temporary increase in annual operating strength. Mobilization  of  reserve  units  and  individual  reservists  for  operations overseas yielded further increases in forces available.

As operating strength increased, progress continued in transforming existing  forces  to  thwart  future  threats.  Former  Army  Chief  of  Staff General Eric K. Shinseki had made Army transformation the primary goal of his tour of duty at the beginning of the decade. Although the Global War on Terrorism eclipsed his concentration on adapting forces to deploy more rapidly and fight more intelligently on a battlefield, efforts remained under way on several projects to modernize and restructure existing Army forces. The Stryker Brigade Combat Teams had already entered the active force with a sixth brigade scheduled to undergo transition in 2008. The Pennsylvania Army National Guard also began the process of converting a  brigade  combat  team  from  the  28th  Infantry  Division  to  the  Stryker configuration. The Stryker units, however, remained an interim solution to  the  goal  of  fielding  lighter  units  capable  of  deploying  rapidly  and hitting  hard.  General  Shinseki  had  envisioned  that  an  'objective  force' that employed the Future Combat Systems (FCS) would fit the bill. While

development of the main FCS vehicles continued, the Department of Defense endorsed the concept of 'spiraling,'  that  is,  integrating  the latest  technologies  that  would  be used by the Objective Force, such as new  generations  of  drone  aircraft, into the existing force as those technologies became available.

In addition to programs intended to modernize operational forces, all three componentsactive Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserveunderwent major restructuring of  their  forces  during  the  fiscal year. Under the leadership of Army Chief of Staff General Peter  J.  Schoomaker,  conversion

continued to the 'modular' formation (that is, enhanced flexibility for a variety of tactical situations) for tactical forces, the most comprehensive reorganization since the early 1960s. In order to convert units without sacrificing  readiness  for  deployment  to  contingency  operations,  the Army's  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-3/5/7,  integrated  all  active-  and reserve-component brigades into a cyclical rotational framework. This framework, known as the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) model,  offered  a  comprehensive  six-year  plan  for  units  to  restructure to new organizations, undergo retraining of individuals, and rehabilitate equipment  after  returning  from  a  deployment.  Once  reorganized  and equipped during a period ranging from one to four years, units entered a 'ready force pool' that underwent 'collective' or unit training to prepare for a potential deployment. The last group, the 'available force pool,' either deployed or remained ready for a deployment.

In addition to operations in the Global War on Terrorism, Army forces continued in engagement and peacekeeping operations elsewhere in the world. About 40 percent of active-duty strength served overseas in seventysix  countries.  Active  and  reserve  units  served  as  part  of  international peacekeeping  missions  in  the  Balkans  (2,000)  and  Egypt  (700).  Other units served as a forward presence in South Korea (19,000) and Western Europe (54,000). The overseas units also conducted exercises with foreign militaries and were able to deploy in their regions to provide humanitarian assistance to foreign nations. These missions continued concurrent with the Global War on Terrorism.

## OrganizatiOn, ManageMent, and Budget

## Reorganizations and Realignments

Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), avoided any major reorganization  in  2006.  Secretary  of  the  Army  Francis  J.  Harvey  and General Schoomaker employed the existing headquarters organization to provide direction and oversight to the  Army' s three large commands (Forces

Command,  Training  and  Doctrine Command, and Army Materiel Command), to direct reporting units (including  Army service component commands), and to field operating agencies and staff support agencies. Having  undergone  reorganization at the beginning of the decade, the headquarters found itself highly committed  to  ongoing  operations, overshadowing any opportunities for further reorganizations.

## Management

FY 2006 hallmarked an expansion in the Army's  use of information technology for both tactical and administrative purposes. Integrating  with  joint  systems,  the Army  further  expanded  both  the Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router

Network  (NIPRNET)  and  the  Secret  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network (SIPRNET).  To  support  the  high  tempo  of  operations  in  the  Central Command's area of responsibility, the Army leased most of the bandwidth required from commercial satellites during the year. Development of new information systems also continued as integral components of the Future

Combat Systems. This integrated family of systems would rely heavily on several information management systems under development during 2006, including  the  Warfighter  Information  Network-Tactical  (WIN-T)  and  the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The Department of the Army' s Deputy Chief  of  Staff,  G-8,  oversaw  all  these  initiatives  from  the  Pentagon  and remained a major participant in both operations and transformation.

## Budget

By FY 2006, four years of war had helped redress more than a decade of erosion in Army budgets. Through increases in annual budgets and in annual supplemental appropriations to pay for the costs of operations, the Army began to catch its breath and endeavor to fund simultaneously two small-scale contingency operations and force modernization. The active Army's authorized end strength had increased beyond the 480,000 level adopted after the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and special annual authorizations for the Global War on Terrorism and the activation of  reserve  units  and  individual  reservists  had  further  increased  strength over the preceding four fiscal years.

The  Army  budget  continued  to  grow  in  FY  2006,  reflecting  the increasing  demands  of  continual  transformation,  modernization,  and operations  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan.  Increases  in  the  president' s  budget request  focused  on  providing  the  Army  with  more  troops,  continuing operations, and maintaining a force stretched over numerous deployments. Savings were made through limited increases in funding for family housing and  decreasing  chemical  demilitarization  funding  to  FY  2003  levels. Overall, the president' s budget request represented a modest increase in funding for the Army ( Table 1 ).

As in the preceding several years, the president' s budget requests did not specifically cover funding for combat operations, including Operations IraqI Freedom and eNdurINg Freedom . These supplemental funds were in addition  to  the  Defense Appropriations Act  and  were  designated  as Title IX, Additional War-Related Appropriations. In FY 2006, the supplemental funding for the Army, which included hurricane relief funding for the areas hit by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, was $32.3 billion. These additional funds yielded a combined appropriation of $131.5 billion for the Army.

The Army's immediate priority remained the Global War on Terrorism. Concurrent  with  that  effort,  discrete  transformation  initiatives  required adequate sourcing to maintain momentum. Immediate funding priorities included the execution of modular redesign of operational forces. Another requirement  was  to  'rebalance'  active  and  reserve  forces,  as  reserve component units transformed from a 'strategic reserve,' which is used for prosecuting major theater wars, to an 'operational reserve,' which would

mobilize and deploy for a small-scale contingency. Certain high-demand reserve-component  units,  including  civil  affairs,  would  transfer  to  the active component because they were needed for successive contingency operations.  This  restructuring  of  the  total  force  also  allowed  units  to 'stabilize' for two years at their home stations before being redeployed to an active theater. A final requirement involved the continued purchase and conversion of tactical vehicles to protect the occupants mainly from improvised explosive devices. The first Buffalo mine-resistant clearance vehicles deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan during the year focused initially on route-clearing missions.

The high level of commitment to ongoing contingency operations had a direct impact on costs for readiness and maintenance of equipment in particular. The budget sought to ensure that active Army units trained for an average of 765 live miles and 85 virtual miles per year for armored and mechanized units. Army National Guard units were funded to train for an average of 190 live and 60 virtual miles per year. Aircrew flying hours would average 13.1 per month for active crews, 7.6 hours per Army National  Guard  crews,  and  6.4  hours  for Army  Reserve  crews.  Depotlevel maintenance, however, was funded at only 73 percent of the required amount for 2006 and sustainment of facilities at only 91 percent.

## The Quadrennial Defense Review

The  third  congressionally  mandated  review  of  national  strategy, forces, modernization plans, and budgets took place in 2005 during the George  W.  Bush  administration.  The  review  was  based  on  the  March 2005 National  Defense  Strategy , which  shifted  the  U.S.  military  focus away  from  traditional  challenges  posed  by  nations  employing  nuclear and  conventional  weapons. A  mounting  consensus  had  emerged  within the national security establishment that the United States had more than sufficient military capabilities to combat such threats, which the United States was unlikely to face in the near future. Instead, emphasis would shift to 'asymmetric threats,' posed by both nations and non-nation adversaries. The new strategic focus also encompassed irregular challenges (including terrorism and guerrilla warfare), catastrophic challenges (including obtaining  weapons  of  mass  destruction),  and  disruptive  challenges  (in which one or more nations might try to negate U.S. military strengths).

With the new emphasis on combating terrorist networks and irregular forces,  the  Defense  Department  pointed  the  way  for  a  reorientation  of forces  and  modernization  projects. The  Defense  Department  submitted its QDR report to Congress on 6 February 2006, thereby concluding the

study. The big winners were special operations forces. With an expansion of  civil  affairs  and  psychological  operations  units  across  the  Defense Department by 3,700 personnel (a 33 percent increase), special operations forces  would increase by 15 percent overall, with Army Special Forces battalions increasing by one-third.

Unlike previous defense reshaping events over the preceding decade, the  Defense  Department  made  no  recommendations  for  major  force reductions during  FY  2006.  Instead,  it recommended  'reorienting' forces within existing military capabilities. The Army' s 2003 decision to convert to a modular design for operational forces served it well in the most recent review. The Defense Department endorsed this redesign as fostering  the  environment  in  which  units  will  be  'modular  in  structure at  all  levels,  largely  self-sustaining,  and  capable  of  operating  both  in traditional formations as well as disaggregating into smaller autonomous units.' Among these units, the Defense Department approved forty-two brigade combat teams in the active Army and twenty-eight in the Army National Guard (for a total of seventy teams). The Defense Department also validated Army personnel strengths, excluding temporary increases to prosecute ongoing operations in Central Asia and the Middle East, as 482,400 active and 533,000 reserve-component personnel.

Following  the  trend  in  defense  reshaping  studies  that  began  with the  first  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  in  1997,  this  most  recent  review operated in an open environment with direct service participation. As with the  2001  Quadrennial  Defense  Review,  HQDA's  Quadrennial  Defense Review Office (QDR Office) coordinated the Army's effort for the review. Headed  by  Brig.  Gen.  Robert  E.  Durbin  until  January  2006,  the  QDR Office reported to the Army' s Deputy Chief of Staff, G-8, who directed the Army's participation in the review and served as the Army point of contact  for  interaction  with  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  and the Joint Staff. All major staff sections in HQDA, as well as the Army' s Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  participated  in  weekly  meetings  and coordination groups that provided Army input into the development of the Defense Department's supporting studies and recommendations.

## 3 Personnel

## Army Strength and Distribution

Although the Defense Department in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review had set the active Army' s end strength for 30 September 2006 at 482,400,  Congress  modified  these  levels  during  the  year.  The  National Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  2006  approved  a  level  of  512,400, provided that supplemental appropriations funded the additional personnel for  service  in  ongoing  operations. As  of  September,  however,  the  actual number of soldiers in the Army totaled 502,790: 420,165 enlisted personnel, 13,009 warrant officers, and 69,616 commissioned officers. There were an additional  4,346  cadets  enrolled  at  the  United  States  Military Academy. Minorities made up a total of 38.4 percent of the active force and women 14.0 percent.

By September 2006, the Army National Guard had a total of 346,288 members  both  drilling  and  mobilized.  Of  this  number,  309,438  were enlisted  personnel,  6,547  warrant  officers,  and  30,303  commissioned officers. Minorities made up a total of 25.5 percent of the National Guard and women 13.5 percent.

The Army Reserve ended the year with a total of 189,975 personnel: 153,565 enlisted personnel, 2,623 warrant officers, and 33,787 commissioned officers. Minorities made up a total of 40.5 percent and women 23.3 percent.

## Manning Initiatives

In 2000, General Shinseki had mandated that the Army would man active  operational  units  at  100  percent  by  the  end  of  the  year,  but  the high tempo of operations and deployments posed a significant challenge to  meeting  this  goal  six  years  later.  Under  the Army  Force  Generation process, priority for manning went to units either deploying or preparing to deploy overseas. The goal was to stabilize unit turbulence by assigning soldiers for at least a thirty-six-month tour of duty. Under this 'life-cycle management' concept, replacements joined and stayed with a unit from the time it trained together prior to deployment until the unit returned from deployment overseas. Soldiers could not transfer from the unit during the cycle except under extraordinary circumstances, but they would transfer

or  leave  active  service  en  mass  once  they  returned  from  an  operational deployment.

## Enlisted Personnel

The twin problems of recruiting and retention continued to challenge Army  leaders  throughout  FY  2006.  The  active  Army  recruited  80,635 soldiers (of this number 11,240 had prior military service) by the end of the  fiscal  year,  thereby  exceeding  the  recruitment  goal  of  80,000. This achievement reversed the failure during the previous year, when the Army had a shortfall of more than 8 percent and was the only service that did not  meet  its  objective.  Both Army  reserve  components,  however,  failed to meet their quantitative goals for the year, resulting in neither the Army National Guard nor the Army Reserve meeting end-strength objectives for 30 September ( Table 2 ).

table 2-u.S. armY enlISted acceSSIon reSultS, FY 2006

| Component           | Goal   | Actual   | Difference   |   Percentage |
|---------------------|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Active Army         | 80,000 | 80,635   | +635         |        100.8 |
| Army National guard | 70,000 | 69,042   | -958         |         98.6 |
| Army Reserve        | 36,032 | 34,379   | -1,653       |         95.4 |

The qualitative  situation  was  another  matter. Although  the  Defense Department's objective for nonprior service recruits was for 90 percent to have high school diplomas, only 81 percent of active Army recruits in 2006 met this standard. This percentage marked a decline from 2005, when 87 percent of recruits had high school diplomas. Of perhaps equal concern, the percentage of Army recruits that scored in the upper half of the Armed Forces Qualification Test declined from 67 percent in 2005 to 61 percent, just above the Defense Department' s 60-percent benchmark. This was the lowest  level  for  the Army  since  1985.  For  the  second  straight  year,  the Army recruited an increasing portion of first-term soldiers with mental test scores in Category IV (the lowest 10th through the 30th percentile of the tested population). The 2006 percentage of these soldiers recruited was 3.8 percent, just below the Defense Department' s upper limit of 4 percent, and far higher than 2004' s 0.5 percent.

Increased reenlistments offered one alternative to alleviate the demand for  recruits.  In  this  regard,  all  three  Army  components  exceeded  their annual goals, despite the strains of wartime service and the prospect of future deployments ( Table 3 ).

table 3-enlISted actIve armY retentIon, FY 2006

| Personnel    | Goal   | Obtained   |   Percentage |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Initial Term | 26,490 | 28,081     |        106   |
| Mid-Career   | 24,510 | 24,562     |        100.2 |
| Career       | 13,200 | 14,664     |        111.1 |
| Total        | 64,200 | 67,307     |        104.8 |

A new incentive, a tax-exempt reenlistment bonus of up to $15,000 for  deployed  soldiers,  helped  attract  reenlistments. As  of  21  September 2006, a total of 23,200 noncommissioned officers and soldiers had taken advantage of this bonus at a cost of $320 million to the Army. This bonus complemented existing bonuses. The 2006 National Defense Authorization Act  also  increased  reenlistment  bonuses  to  a  maximum  of  $90,000  for individuals in critical specialties.

One incentive that helped with recruiting included an increase in the maximum bonus from $20,000 to $40,000 for active soldiers (and from $10,000 to $20,000 for reservists). Other incentives included an increase in  the  maximum  age  for  enlistment  to  42  years,  expanding  the  student loan repayment program, and matching funds for the federal government' s Thrift Savings Plan to also include uniformed military personnel. A final incentive included a $1,000 referral bonus for active soldiers and retirees who referred a qualified enlistee.

One significant change to the Army' s recruiting strategy that yielded results over the year was an increase in the recruiting force. Having declined from 6,400 in 2002 to an average of 5,100 two years later, this reduced workforce  proved  unable  to  handle  the  increased  workload  required to  expand  the  force  to  conduct  operations  overseas.  Consequently,  the average strength of the Army' s recruiting force increased to 6,500 in 2006. Unfortunately, Army-sponsored studies indicated that individual recruiters did not reach the optimal level of productivity until they had been on the job eighteen months. While at its highest strength in four years, the Army' s recruiting force was still relatively inexperienced.

## Officer Personnel

Reorganization of  Army operational forces and continuing contingency operations generated pressures for increased officer accessions during the year. Having adopted new tables of organization and equipment developed by the Training and Doctrine Command for modular units that required more  company-grade  and  field-grade  officer  personnel,  the  Army  had

to  educate  an  increasing  number  of  new  leaders.  Consequently,  despite generally good officer retention, the active Army remained about 3,500 officers  short  of  requirements,  mostly  in  the  rank  of  major  and  senior captain.

The  active Army  sought  to  commission  4,600  officers  in  the  basic branches in 2006 (excluding medical, legal, and other specialist branches). The United  States  Military Academy  commissioned  only  846  of  these, falling  short  of  the  goal  of  900. The  Reserve  Officers' Training  Corps (ROTC) goal of 2,525 for the year remained slightly higher than enrolled cadets graduating that year, and the Army fell short. One problem with relying on ROTC as a source for officers is that while the Army' s estimates were for 31,000 cadets in the four-year program required to sustain the annual  goals,  only  25,100  participated  in  2006.  As  usual,  the  officer candidate school made up the difference, with a quota of 1,420 for the year, close to full capacity. This figure marked a significant increase in the output for this source, from 484 in 2000, to a level that would account for between 25 and 30 percent of new officers each year. Unfortunately, only slightly more than 80 percent of officers commissioned through the officer candidate school held bachelor' s degrees or higher.

As in the case of the enlisted force, the two main keys to building officer strength were by initial entry and by retention. The Army undertook several  initiatives  to  strengthen  retention.  One  major  change  involved the continued increase in promotion opportunity in ranks up to colonel, permitting  more  officers  to  rise  and  fewer  having  to  face  mandatory separation. The Army also continued to accelerate promotion to captain from the 1980 Defense Officer Personnel Management Act goal of fortyeight  months  of  active  commissioned  service  to  a  thirty-eight-month promotion 'pin-on point.'

Another  method  of  retention  was  to  extend  obligated  service  for younger officers. For example, the number of high-performing companygrade officers offered graduate school annually increased by an additional 200 spaces from 412 to 612 fully funded positions.  As in recent years, newly commissioned officers willing to extend their initial service obligation for three years could opt for either their first choice of branch assignment or a guaranteed duty station. Although these incentives had been available to enlistees for decades, this was the first time that the Army offered such incentives to new officers. By the end of the fiscal year, over 1,100 officers had signed up for these incentives.

## Civilian Personnel

The Army  employed  244,385  civilians  as  of  30  September  2006. Indirect hires of foreign nationals in Germany, the Republic of Korea,

and  other  nations,  totaled  17,742.  In  June,  the  secretary  of  the Army designated  permanent  civilian  employees  as  members  of  the  Army Civilian  Corps.  This  designation  underscored  the  degree  to  which civilians  have  integrated  into  the  Defense  Department's  Total  Force concept over the preceding three decades. It also, however, portended a  potential  challenge  to  the  Defense  Department's  civilian  executive development  system  for  GS-13  through  GS-15  civilian  managers. Established in response to a recommendation by the 1997 Quadrennial Defense  Review,  this  personnel  development  program  hallmarked  a modest and almost meek effort to assert department control over civilian personnel at the expense of service autonomy. Among other features, the program undertook directed reassignments of civilian managers between services to develop a workforce with a broader perspective on Defense Department-wide issues and problems.

The National Security Personnel System (NSPS), however, offered the prospect of a sweeping revision to Defense Department management of civilians. The Army planned to phase in the new system over several years, commencing  in  2006.  This  system  was  intended  to  streamline  hiring, improve  performance  management,  supplant  the  existing  civil  service system, and afford managers more flexibility in reassigning personnel. A key aspect of the new system would be performance pay as an incentive for meeting work objectives delineated in a detailed performance plan. This system, however, immediately drew controversy from unions representing Army civilians, portending a tumultuous future.

## Special Topics

In 1986, the Army had established a commander's program aimed at minimizing suicides in the Army. Despite these efforts designed to educate leaders  to  recognize  warning  signs  and  monitor  at-risk  personnel,  the suicide rate in the active Army' s fourth year of war climbed from 9.8 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.2 per 100,000 in 2006. That year, the Army' s Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, Lt. Gen. Franklin L. Hagenbeck, chaired a multiagency Army working group tasked to find a collective solution to what threatened to become an epidemic. Among the issues studied, the task force identified that  from  2005  to  2007  about  73  percent  of  suicides  occurred  at  home stations. Stress indicators that warned of suicidal behavior wore the historic problems that plagued young soldiers, including job-related problems, a recently  failed  relationship,  or  legal  and  financial  difficulties. The  high tempo of ongoing operations and deployments exacerbated the strains on soldiers.

Of less critical concern to Army leaders, but still a significant issue, was the stop-loss policy, that is, the involuntary retention of soldiers on

active duty past their contracted term of service. This policy remained a smoldering morale issue for soldiers. The Army had employed stop loss in  times  of  crisis  since  1984,  to  retain  soldiers  with  critically  needed skills.  From  the  first  month  of  the  Global War  on Terrorism,  the Army consistently used this authority to maintain unit readiness, retain selected personnel with critical skills, and retain those whose term of service was scheduled to expire just before or during a deployment. For instance, the Army had 11,983 enlisted personnel who met these criteria in September 2006. Although the other services had also used this policy for involuntary retention after September 2001, they had stopped it by 2006. Consequently, the  Army  faced  increasing  pressures  from  Congress  and  the  Defense Department to curtail its use, and in January 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates directed the Army to minimize the use of involuntary retention.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Transformation During Contingency Operations

The Army headquarters' main priorities during the fiscal year remained supporting  current  contingency  operations  and  peacetime  deployments, maintaining the current force, and developing the future force. Operations in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  drove  continued  emphasis  on  managing  units preparing for deployment and units recovering from operations overseas. Key responsibilities for the headquarters were ensuring that units preparing to deploy received adequate equipment, trained personnel, resources for pre-deployment collective training, and once in theater received HQDA support. Returning units would enter a 'stabilization' phase, emphasizing rehabilitation of equipment subjected to hard use in theater. Finally, Army headquarters would designate which units would deploy in the next cycle, striving to ensure that active-component units remained at home stations for at least two years prior to redeployment. While managing deployments for current operations, the Army could not neglect ongoing modernization efforts that would yield units fielding new hardware both for the battlefield of  the  future  and  for  upcoming  contingency  deployments.  Using  a transformation campaign plan, the Army' s Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, worked assiduously to integrate the myriad of complex operations across the Army and Defense Department essential for success.

## Modularity

Beginning  in  September  2003,  the  Army  undertook  a  planned sequential conversion of operational forces from fixed divisions to brigadebased modular formations. The conversion process continued during 2006. In  addition  to  maneuver  brigades,  combat  support  and  combat  service support formations also converted to modular brigade designs. Reservecomponent units joined their active Army counterparts in this endeavor, often coordinating their reorganization with mobilization, prior to deployment to an active theater. The requirement to deploy large numbers of units while converting them into a new configuration and training them

in  this  new  organization  prior  to deployment proved the crux of the Army's challenge.

Restructuring and expanding  forces  concurrently  proved  an ambitious  goal.  During  the  fiscal year, Lt. Gen. James J. Lovelace Jr., the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7,  undertook  a  study  that identified the Army' s goal for operational forces as seventy maneuver brigade combat teams, twenty-three aviation  brigades,  thirteen  fire  brigades, thirty sustainment brigades, fifteen combat support brigades (maneuver enhancement), and five battlefield surveillance brigades. These forces included active Army, Army  National  Guard,  and  Army Reserve units. Of the planned seventy brigade combat teams, forty-two  would  be  active  Army

and twenty-eight Army National Guard. These maneuver brigades would be  of  three  basic  designs:  infantry  (including  airborne  and  air  assault), heavy, and Stryker. Plans continued through the year to increase maneuver brigades to seventy-six.

The  Army  was  more  than  halfway  through  conversion  in  2006, completing thirty-one brigade combat teams and 131 of over 200 support brigade  conversions  by  February  2007.  In  2006,  the  active Army  alone converted thirteen maneuver brigades and four support brigades. Another four active brigade combat teams initiated conversion during the year, and fifty-one of both components either had completed conversion or were in the process of converting in February 2007.

## Rebalancing and Stabilization

The  2006  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  endorsed  Army  plans  to expand deployable forces through initiatives such as 'rebalancing' and yet another attempt at 'civilianizing' jobs in the continental United States, in particular jobs that did not require soldiers to perform. The Army' s new strategic goal prescribed a force of eighteen to nineteen brigade combat teams and supporting units available for worldwide deployment, with an additional eighteen to nineteen brigades able to surge in an emergency,

under  the Army  Force  Generation  model.  Other  units  would  be  in  the 'reset' pool recovering from a recent deployment and likely completing conversion  into  a  modular  configuration.  To  meet  this  goal,  the  Army planned to convert forty thousand soldiers from nondeployable assignments in such functions as individual training into the operational forces over the subsequent six years. Another major function of this restructuring was the transfer of a number of high-demand units from the reserve component to the active Army. In 2006, for example, over 90 percent of civil affairs units were in the Army Reserve. These units required a laborious mobilization and  training  process  prior  to  their  deployment.  To  avoid  the  pitfall  of overcommitting reserve units, among other problems, the Army increased the  number  of  transferred  positions  between  components  in  2006  to 57,000. Most of these were in military police, civil affairs, and infantry units, although military intelligence and special forces also calculated in the 116,000 positions designated for conversion by 2013.

In order to free up soldiers in the active component in particular, Army leaders also continued the tide of military-to-civilian conversions. By the end of 2006, the Army had converted 7,170 military positions to civilians, freeing soldiers to man new operating forces.

All three components of the  Army were well en route by the end of 2006 to  implementing  the  Force  Generation  model.  For  active Army  brigade combat teams, units returning from deployment would enter a 'reset and train  pool'  for  between  three  and  twelve  months.  Once  personnel  had stabilized and the unit had transferred equipment that required depot-level rehabilitation, the unit commenced a training cycle, intended to begin the restoration of unit readiness levels. During the second year after return, a brigade would serve in the 'ready pool,' completing collective training and preparing for possible deployment, if required. During the third year, active  brigades  would  enter  the  third  pool,  the  'available  pool,'  during which units would normally deploy for most or all of that period. Army National Guard brigade combat teams followed the same model, except they operated on a six-year rather than a three-year cycle. These brigades would  serve  four  years  rather  than  one  in  the  'reset  and  train  pool,' allowing more time for training while in inactive-duty status, mobilization, reequipping, and conversion to modular organization.

The  Army  Force  Generation  model  also  had  ramifications  in  the manpower arena. Army leaders sought to stabilize personnel in deploying units  not  only  while  they  served  overseas,  but  also  during  the  predeployment training phase and at least part of the post-deployment phase. Their plan was for thirteen brigade combat teams to be under what was called the life-cycle management personnel assignment model, en route to full transformation for maneuver brigade teams (except Germany and South Korea) by 2011. Under this system, personnel managers assigned

individuals  to  a  brigade  for  a  stabilized  thirty-six-month  tour  of  duty, synchronized  with  the  unit' s  deployment  cycle.  Hopefully,  personnel stability within a brigade would promote an environment in which units would build, train, and deploy together as highly cohesive teams.

## Modernization: The Interim and Objective Forces

Initially labeled the Interim Force earlier in the decade as part of the Army's overall transformation strategy, the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams were now integral to the Army' s spectrum of forces available to combatant commanders. By 2006, the Stryker had entered the force and deployed in brigade combat teams to Iraq.

Four active-component brigades completed certification and constituted part of the rotational pool for contingency operations. One of these brigades had deployed to Vilseck, Germany, during the year to serve as a forwardpresence  unit. A  fifth  active  brigade  in  Hawaii  had  begun  to  receive  its Strykers  and  envisioned  certification  and  availability  for  deployment  in 2006. The Pennsylvania Army National Guard' s 56th Brigade, 28th Infantry Division, also began conversion into a Stryker brigade in 2006, planning on  availability  for  deployment  in  2009.  The  seventh  brigade  (an  activecomponent brigade) would begin conversion in 2007.

The Stryker vehicle, perhaps the heart of the system, proved a successful weapon during stability operations in Iraq. Over fourteen hundred Stryker vehicles were delivered by the end of FY 2006, and the first two deployed brigades had driven over five million miles. Nonetheless, a key vehicle variant,  the  armored gun system, remained in development, leaving the brigade with a shortfall in direct-fire support and antitank capabilities.

From General Shinseki's tour as chief of staff, the Army considered the  Stryker  an  interim  solution  to  fielding  a  new  generation  of  forces that combined ease of deployment with lethality. Stryker brigades could combine with existing airborne, air assault, and light infantry units into task-organized packages for contingency operations. The only significant complication  to  these  forces  operating  together  was  how  well  they integrated with the most modern digital command and control systems. Each  type  of  brigade  could  deploy  by  means  of  existing  aircraft  to  an austere theater. The goal for an 'objective force,' desired by the end of the decade, was a combined arms team that also incorporated a new type of heavy, or mechanized, brigade that also combined attributes of lighter weight than the present generation of equipment.

The  Future  Combat  Systems  would  integrate  a  new  generation  of fighting vehicles with new systems for command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. During the first year of the decade, the Army had indulged an open discussion of options

for  lightening  the  weight  of  a  new  generation  of  vehicles  that  would replace the Abrams tank, Bradley armored fighting vehicle, and Paladin self-propelled howitzer. Desirable objectives for new vehicles would be reduced  weight  and  fuel  requirements. The Army  backed  the  objective force  with  dollars,  truncating  existing  modernization  programs  to  pay for  what  would  become  the  Future  Combat  Systems.  By  2006,  Army leaders  had  canceled  over  a  hundred  programs  to  fund  development  of this  paramount  force  modernization  program,  and  proposals  stabilized on eighteen discrete development projects, integrated into a network that linked vehicles, leaders, and ground and air sensors. The Future Combat Systems, however, remained an ambitious project and attracted its share of critics. Responding to both the uneven pace of development for all eighteen subordinate systems and the demands to get technology onto the battlefield once it matured, Army leaders modified the Future Combat Systems (FCS) in  2006.  Instead  of  developing,  testing,  and  fielding  a  complete  FCSequipped brigade combat team as a complete package, individual elements would enter the force once available for fielding. These new technologies would  'spin  out'  into  units  equipped  with  existing  hardware.  Because of budget cuts and development difficulties, Army leaders opted to defer development of four of the eighteen core systems in 2006, including two types of unmanned aerial vehicles. Cuts also delayed the date for fielding the first FCS-equipped brigade to 2015. With planned procurement of one brigade set per year, the Army would convert the last of fifteen planned brigades in 2030.

## Army Aviation

If the Future  Combat  Systems  remained  in  the  research  and development phases of modernization, several aviation programs were adding new aircraft to the force. Deliveries of AH-64D Longbow Apache helicopters  to  the  active  component  were  reaching  completion,  with deliveries to the reserve components coming next. Planned deliveries of the CH-47F Chinook should begin in 2007. The UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter would enter the force a year later. Upgrading and rebuilding of AH-64, CH-47, and UH-60 helicopters, already in the force, continued. The  rebuilt  aircraft  in  effect  would  perform  at  the  same  operational readiness levels as relatively new aircraft.

Modernization plans continued toward the development and fielding of a new generation of helicopters and aircraft. The newest project would replace the canceled RAH-66 Comanche helicopter. Under development by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. under a $2.2-billion contract, the armed reconnaissance helicopter would replace the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior in that role. Having begun development in 2004, the first of 368 helicopters would enter in the force in 2007. A second development program, the light utility helicopter, sought to replace UH-1 Huey helicopters in light utility and medical evacuation roles, relying on a 'commercial off-theshelf/non-developmental'  model.  In  June  2006,  the  Army  awarded  a

contract to EADS North America for the first of a planned 345 UH-72 Lakota  helicopters,  the  first  delivered  in  2007. The  final  development contract was for a future cargo aircraft to replace the C-23 Sherpa fixedwing transport. Another example of a non-developmental aircraft, this cargo transport could be a joint project with the Air Force, which also expressed interest in acquiring cargo aircraft.

## Training

As noted above in the 'Budget' section, the Army has maintained a  training  standard  defined  in  terms  of  operational  tempo  for  nearly two decades. With the demand for units to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq,  deploying units met these training milestones, for the most part. Units that had just returned from deployment, however, generally missed annual goals as might be expected from a force at war. The emphasis for returning units was instead on individual training such as attending Army  schools  and  seeking  professional  military  education  through distance learning.

Despite  the  pace  of  combat  operations  and  force  management challenges, the Army also turned its attention to how to grow the next generation  of  Army  leaders.  Among  steps  to  improve  education  and professional  development  of  leaders,  the  Army  leadership  chartered a  study  entitled  Review  of  Education, Training,  and Assignments  for Leaders Task Force  Meeting from September 2005 through June 2006, . the task force made several recommendations for the best ways to train, develop, and assign the leaders of the future in both the operational and institutional Army. The task force conducted in-depth reviews of officer, noncommissioned officer, and civilian leader development. Among the recommendations,  the  study  group  asserted  that  future  leaders  in  the projected strategic and operational environment would have to develop skills beyond those considered traditionally military in nature. Among the  types  of  leaders  needed  would  be  'warrior  leaders,'  'strategic thinkers,'  'business/enterprise  managers,'  'team  builders  and  leader developers,' and 'diplomats of the Army.' An essential outgrowth of the increasing importance of civilian leaders at all echelons of the Army was the creation of a civilian corps with a related education and development system. The task force completed its work and produced a final report in November 2006.

## Deployed Operational Forces

The  Army's  main  priority  remained  providing  forces  to  the  U.S. Central Command for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. At the end of

January 2006, about ninety-eight thousand soldiers were serving in Iraq with another fourteen thousand in Kuwait supporting them. The U.S.led Multi-National Force-Iraq had fourteen Army brigade combat teams, two division headquarters, and one corps headquarters in theater. Another sixteen thousand soldiers served in Afghanistan supporting Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan at the same time, in three brigade combat teams and one division headquarters.

Army  troops  in  Iraq  continued  to  fight  on  the  front  lines  of pacification  efforts  in  major  parts  of  the  country  while  concurrently training Iraqi military, paramilitary, and police forces. The Army units served as part of a coalition effort with the bulk of operational forces stationed  in  northern  and  central  Iraq,  including  Baghdad.  Smaller Army detachments also served in advisory missions to Iraqi military and paramilitary forces and in provincial reconstruction teams that undertook civil  military  operations  in  the  countryside  intended  to  help  the  Iraqi government pacify the country ( Table 4 ).

Despite  a  disturbing  number  of  casualties  that  highlighted  an ongoing insurrection, General George M. Casey, the commander of both

U.S. and coalition forces, noted progress in developing Iraqi governing and  security  forces.  Among  other  recent  achievements,  the  Iraqis approved a constitution in October and elected a four-year government in December. About 75 percent of registered voters participated in the December election. Of perhaps equal importance, over 275,000 Iraqis were serving in the military, police, or other security services, the force having doubled in just over a year and a half. General Casey identified the insurgency as active in only six of Iraq' s eighteen provinces.

Opposing  the  insurgents,  Multi-National  Force-Iraq  had  forces from thirty-seven countries at its peak strength that supported nascent Iraqi security forces in their efforts to suppress terrorism and outbreak of insurgency by disaffected domestic elements. The major U.S. ground force  component,  Multi-National  Corps-Iraq,  underwent  a  transition in  January  2006  when  the  V  Corps  headquarters  replaced  the  XVIII Airborne Corps, which returned to the United States.

Operations  also  continued  in  Afghanistan,  primarily  focused  on building  a  viable Afghan  state  capable  of  assuming  internal  security, governance, and humanitarian assistance functions. In the interim, the North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization's  Combined  Forces  CommandAfghanistan  continued  operations  against  al-Qaeda  remnants  and  the Taliban  while  undertaking  reconstruction  and  other  nation-building efforts intended to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government. Leading the direct fight  against  the  Taliban  and  other  insurgents,  Combined Joint Task Force 76 was commanded by a U.S. division headquarters. The Army's 10th Mountain Division headquarters relieved U.S. Army Europe's Southeast Task Force in February 2006 as the headquarters for this  task  force  that  pursues  an  operational  concept  intended  to  'clear, hold,  build,  and  engage.' The  International  Security Assistance  Force coordinated  most  of  the  efforts  to  strengthen  governance,  coordinate relief  efforts,  and  enable  economic  development  in  conjunction  with Afghan  authorities.  By  the  end  of  the  year,  this  organization  and  its regional headquarters had twenty-four provincial reconstruction teams operating  in  the  countryside.  The  U.S.  Combined  Security Transition Command-Afghanistan was the third subordinate element, and by the autumn of 2006, had helped organize, train, and equip seventy thousand Afghan security forces.

Army operations in the theater did not come without cost. During FY 2006, Army casualties  in Afghanistan  increased  slightly  from  the previous year ( Table 5 ).

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Change

The two most significant issues affecting both the Army National Guard  and  the  Army  Reserve  during  the  year  were  the  continued mobilization and deployment of forces in the Global War on Terrorism and the conversion of units to modular configurations. The Army had mobilized 72,000 national guardsmen in early 2006, including those preparing  for  deployment.  By  May  of  that  year,  more  than  35,000 guardsmen  were  serving  in  Operation IraqI  Freedom , while  those in  Afghanistan  exceeded  12,000.  Another  585  supported  the  U.S. Northern Command along the southwestern U.S. border and as part of Operation Noble eagle . Those mobilized forces included 18 percent of Army National Guard aviation units. In January 2006, about 41,000 Army reservists were serving on active duty. In October of that year, 32,000 of these were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Both components also began converting units to the same modular tables  of  organization  and  equipment  used  by  the  active  component. Over  the  year,  the  Army  National  Guard  completed  the  conversion of  six  brigade  combat  teams  and  two  division  headquarters  to  the modular design and began the transition of another nine brigades and two additional division headquarters. The Army Reserve also planned to convert its deployable forces into fifty-eight modular brigade-based combat  support  and  combat  service  support  units  over  the  next  few years,  with  three  support  brigades  completing  the  process  in  2006. Transformation  of  reserve-component  units  posed  the  same  scale  of difficulties as for active-component units, but with one major difference. Conversion subsequent to mobilization and prior to collective training offered the quickest method, but at an expense appropriate only for those brigades  scheduled  for  overseas  deployment.  Conversion  of  inactive brigades in conjunction with weekend drills and annual training proved a protracted affair, often requiring several years to complete military occupation skill training for soldiers reassigned to different functions.

The  Army  Reserve  also  conducted  other  major  unit  conversions during the year, as part of the reshaping of Army forces and capabilities within  its  authorized  205,000-soldier  end  strength.  Perhaps  the  most

significant Army action resulted from the transfer of reserve-component civil  affairs  and  psychological  operations  units  from  under  the Army Special Operations Command to report to the Army Reserve Command. Civil  affairs  companies  would  also  grow  from  64  to  112  tactical companies by 2011.

## Personnel Management

The Army National Guard fell short of its end-strength objective of 350,000, finishing the fiscal year with an end strength of 346,288. Nonetheless, this achievement marked a net increase of 13,111 soldiers over the preceding year, and the first net gain in over two years. Total strength included 30,303 commissioned officers, 6,547 warrant officers,  and  309,438  enlisted  personnel.  Minorities  constituted  25.5 percent  of  the  Army  National  Guard  and  women  13.5  percent.  The Army Reserve filled 189,975 positions out of an authorized strength of 205,000. Minorities constituted 40.5 percent and women 23.3 percent.

## Recruiting and Retention

In order to reverse its shortfalls in recruiting and retention for four consecutive  years,  the Army  National  Guard  increased  its  recruiting force and retention of noncommissioned officers from 2,700 in 2004 to 5,100 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. It increased enlistment bonuses to a maximum  of  $10,000  ($15,000  for  prior service enlistments). Retention bonuses also increased from $5,000 to $15,000. Overall  recruiting  brought  in  69,042  soldiers,  including  more  than 10,000 nonprior service recruits (100.6 percent of the year's objective). The National Guard met 96 percent of its goal for prior service recruits. The Army Guard employed the Guard Recruiting Assistance Program for the first time in 2006 to recruit 15,106 new soldiers. This program involved 88,900 recruiting assistants paid up to $2,000 per recruit. The Army Reserve also recruited 34,379 soldiers in 2006, falling short of its  goal  of  36,032  (95  percent).  Having suffered recruiting shortfalls two years in a row, the Army Reserve remained significantly below end strength  of  205,000. The  trend,  however,  was  positive  and  the Army Reserve increased its recruiting force to 1,794 by August 2006.

Partly  offsetting  difficulties  with  recruiting  new  soldiers,  both components improved their retention in 2006.  The Defense Department's maximum  attrition  ceiling  for  the  Army  National  Guard  was  19.5 percent  for  2006.  It  achieved  an  average  of  18.4  percent,  exceeding the standard. The Army Reserve also came in under its ceiling of 28.6 percent, losing 21.58 percent during the fiscal year.

## Training and Readiness

The pace of mobilization and operations hindered readiness during the year. Mobilization of individuals to complete personnel allotments and the transfer of vehicles and other major items of hardware for deploying units posed  the  major  problem  for  readiness.  In  addition  to  service  overseas in  two  active  theaters  of  operation  and  in  the  United  States,  more  than 11,000 soldiers deployed overseas during the year. A 2006 Army National Guard report noted that 'since July 2002 . . . overall unit readiness has decreased by 49.25 percent while providing personnel and equipment to units  to  ensure  fully-prepared  National  Guard  forces  for  deployment.' Nonetheless, even with mobilization, deployments, and unit conversions, the National Guard Bureau endeavored to retain at least 50 percent of a state' s forces in an inactive status available for employment by the state' s adjutant general in the event of an emergency. The reduction of federal funding for collective training to  $722 million for the year (85 percent of  required  resources)  further  compounded  problems  with  attaining  an essential level of readiness.

Despite the challenges of unit transformation and overseas operations, reserve-component units sought to maintain their edge through training in the United States. A mobilized Army National Guard brigade that attended the Joint Readiness Training Center, at Fort Polk, Louisiana, provided the highlight for training in 2006. More than 2,100 other guardsmen from seven brigade combat teams also participated in the Brigade Battle Command Staff Training Program. An additional 800 personnel from one National Guard  division  participated  in  the  Army  Combined  Arms  Command' s Battle Command Training Program seminar at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This five-day seminar and follow-on computer-based simulation exercise honed command and staff skills,  the  military  decision-making  process, and integration of combat assets into a realistic division-level battle. More than 1,000 guardsmen also participated in National Training Center (Fort Irwin, California) and Joint Readiness Training Center events during their annual training periods.

## Mobilization

Mobilization of units both for deployment overseas and for domestic operations became almost second nature to reserve-component units by 2006.  In  addition  to  units  and  guardsmen  serving  in  Operations IraqI Freedom , eNdurINg Freedom , and Noble eagle , during the year the Army Guard assumed another domestic security mission. In May, the president had directed the deployment of Army guardsmen to the southwestern U.S. border  to  support  U.S  customs  and  border  control  agents  in  Operation

Jump Start .  By the end of September, 5,252 guardsmen from forty-one states had served on the border either in an annual training status or on active  duty  for  special  work. Among  other  contributions,  these  soldiers helped apprehend 11,265 aliens; seize 184 vehicles; seize 39,733 pounds of illegal drugs; construct 27.9 miles of roads; install 4.2 miles of fencing and 32.7 miles of vehicle barriers; and construct two forward-operating bases, one in Yuma, Arizona, and the other in Deming, New Mexico, each base housing and sustaining 700 soldiers.

The  most  extensive  domestic  operations  of  the  fiscal  year  were  the responses to the two major hurricanes that struck the Gulf Coast in the late summer of 2005. Hurricane Katrina struck Mississippi  and  Louisiana  in late August. It was followed in late September by Hurricane Rita, which struck eastern Texas and Louisiana again. After a massive response by Army National Guard units on state active duty responding to the immediate crisis (with more than 42,000 serving on 29 September), several units remained on state duty into the new fiscal year. This was the largest response by the Army National Guard to a natural disaster, to date, assisting in the evacuation of more than 70,000 people. The Army Reserve also contributed to these relief efforts, providing fifteen CH-47 helicopters and two truck companies. The helicopters alone transported more than 2,100 civilians.

## Materiel and Aviation

The ongoing conversion of the 56th Brigade, 28th Infantry Division (Pennsylvania Army National Guard), to a Stryker Brigade  Combat  Team  remained the most significant Army National Guard modernization effort during the year. Conversion of units to modular configurations also provided additional requirements for vehicles, communications equipment, and other hardware. Most of this came from redistribution  of  existing  materiel from  Army  National  Guard  and other Army sources. But the National  Guard  also  spent  $730 million  during  the  year  on  new equipment, including 2,358 family of medium  tactical  vehicles  and 4,616 movement tracking systems.

Both components, however, suffered during the year from

disruptions  in  key  unit  materiel,  stemming  primarily  from  mobilization and deployment requirements. The Army National Guard suffered from a shortage of materiel on hand in units since September 2001 that reached almost 46 percent in 2006. As units mobilized for deployment, they turned to  other  reserve-component units first  for  equipment  to  fill  any  gaps  in their unit, or any unserviceable vehicles or other materiel, not eligible for deployment. Consequently, units  remaining  behind  suffered  progressive losses of serviceable equipment and degradation of overall unit readiness.

Despite  this  handicap,  modernization  of  aviation  forces  continued during the year. In addition, all eight division aviation brigades completed the transition to modular designs. The Army Guard also received fourteen UH-60 utility helicopters from the active Army, raising the National Guard inventory  to  633  out  of  a  required  force  of  758.  The  National  Guard' s CH-47 force also remained understrength, with 132 out of 159 required. The inventory of AH-64 helicopters increased by three during the year to 154 out of 222 required. Five OH-58D helicopters also joined the National Guard during the year, increasing the inventory to 23 out of 30 required. The air fixed-wing fleet remained steady with no gains or losses during the year.

## Reset

The  tempo  of  overseas  operations  and  battle  damage  and  wear  to vehicles and aircraft proved a major cost to the Army in the Global War on Terrorism. High operating tempos, desert environments, and limited in-theater  maintenance  capabilities  aged  hardware  at  a  rate  four  times faster  for  units  deployed  to  operational  theaters  than  elsewhere  in  the Army. Units returning from an overseas deployment often left serviceable equipment behind for their replacements. Other units that had extensively worn their equipment shipped it back to home base, often along with other damaged or extensively operated hardware from the theater. These items would  subsequently  enter  the  Army' s  maintenance  depots,  or  in  some cases through maintenance by contractors, for extensive overhaul beyond the  capability  of  theater  maintenance  units.  The  Army  referred  to  this program as 'reset,' meaning that several possible actions could be taken to return unit equipment to an appropriate level of combat capability based on missions and available funding. Based on an assessment of each item, the  process  would  involve  one  or  more  of  the  following:  replace  either the entire item or only the severely damaged components; recapitalize the item by restoring its useful service life (sometimes back to zero miles and zero hours of wear) and repair battle damage; reset at the national level to correct equipment faults beyond the capability of field-level maintenance organizations; and reconstitute to correct equipment faults at the field level. Funding for most of these efforts came from HQDA, either from Army operations and maintenance funds or from supplemental appropriations.

Established  in  2003,  this  major  equipment  rehabilitation  program was built on the success of the Army recapitalization program that, from 2001, sought to extend the useful service life of aging equipment. Key maintenance  functions  normally  performed  at  the  Army' s  maintenance depots included replacement or rebuilding of engines, transmissions, and hydraulic and electrical systems in vehicles. This process also provided selected opportunities to integrate new electronic components or sensors to upgrade capability in a system.

Maintaining the readiness level of the Army' s helicopter fleet quickly became one of the  first  priorities.  Beginning  in  April  2003,  the  Army  Materiel

<!-- image -->

Command coordinated a program of inspection, repair, and overhaul of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft at fourteen sites in the United States and  Germany.  Restoration  of  each  aircraft  to  combat  capability  proved the first hurdle, often requiring overhaul of engines and rotor blades from damage resulting from desert environments with fine sand and extreme heat conditions. The larger objective required returning each airframe to as close in capability as a new one, without any degradation in capability due to wear. Based on the degree of rehabilitation or modernization sought, the amount of time required for an airframe took between 34 and more than 200 days.

By the end of 2005, the Army's materiel rehabilitation program for returning equipment from overseas had been ongoing for over two years. Both  the Army  Materiel  Command  and  the Army's  program  executive officer/program manager communities became very engaged in the process. For 2006, the rehabilitation process involved 350,000 pieces of equipment from  more  than  fifty  brigades,  including  615  aircraft,  7,000  combat vehicles, and 30,000 wheeled vehicles. Once the program was going full stride, the standard for rehabilitation of a full set of unit equipment was six months for an active unit and twelve months for a reserve-component outfit. The Army requested $13.5 billion in reset funds for 2006, but the

Defense Department approved only $8.6 billion in funding in the 2006 supplemental appropriation. This left a backlog of unfunded requirements that the Army was able to address during the next year when it successfully argued for $17.1 billion for this purpose in the 2007 budget.

The rehabilitation program returned serviceable equipment to units, but at the expense of keeping a larger quantity of equipment undergoing depot-level  maintenance  than  during  normal  peacetime  operations. The overhaul of large quantities of equipment provided shortfalls in materiel that affected units at home  stations,  especially reserve-components units.  For  instance,  one  study  estimated  that  at  the  end  of  2006, Army units in Europe and the United States suffered a shortage of 13,000 highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs), 32,000 family of medium tactical vehicles (FMTV) trucks, and 7,600 heavy trucks. Some components  were  also  too  badly  damaged  for  economical  repair  and needed replacement from supplemental appropriations. One Congressional Budget Office analyst estimated that 12 percent of wheeled vehicles, 2 percent of tracked vehicles, and 3 percent of helicopters serving in Iraq in 2005 would fall in this category.

## Management and Planning

The continued implementation of the Single Army Logistics Enterprise (SALE) remained the most important management transformation within the Army's logistical community in 2006. This information management system  sought  to  integrate  and  replace  existing  logistics  automation systems  while  streamlining  them  in  the  process.  The  new  system  of systems integrated three components: the Global Combat  Support System-Army  (GCSS-A),  the  Logistics  Modernization  Program,  and the  Product  Lifecycle  Management Plus System. The GCSS-A reached across Army operating forces and focused on logistical needs of existing systems. The new integrated system of systems would allow the GCSS-A to interact not only with automated systems integral to the Army Materiel Command, but also with acquisition and financial management systems. Once implemented, SALE would offer leaders at all levels of command unprecedented  visibility  into  requisition,  inventory,  and  distribution  of materiel and consumable items of supply.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The  Future  Combat  Systems  remained  the Army' s  most  significant force modernization program in 2006. Having restructured the program in 2005, Army leaders planned to introduce each component of the integrated system  into  existing  forces  as  it  completed  development,  rather  than

<!-- image -->

await  production  of  all  elements in an integrated unit fielding package. By 2006, the Army goal was to 'spin out' these new technologies in four increments at approximately two-year intervals.

A soldier prepares to launch an unmanned aerial vehicle.

As  of  the  end  of  2006,  the Army  planned  to  field  the  first FCS-manned  vehicles  in 2014. The Future Combat Systems remained a very ambitious force modernization program, with individual systems vulnerable through the protracted development process. The operating  concept  for  this  force was  indeed  revolutionary,  calling for a FCS-equipped  brigade  to 'see  first, understand  first,  and act first decisively.'  Implicit  in this concept was  that superior battlefield situational awareness would permit reduction of armored protection on manned vehicles to a level not fielded since World War II. Lighter vehicles, while perhaps more vulnerable to direct hits from kinetic energy warheads, would be transportable in a greater diversity of transport aircraft,  enabling  at  least  the  vehicles  in  the  force  to  arrive  much  more rapidly than ever before. Such design concepts, however, inevitably drew critics  both  inside  and  outside  the Army.  Unmanned  ground  and  aerial reconnaissance systems also had become bogged down in developmental difficulties, portending continued controversy over the next few years.

While  the  Future  Combat  Systems  consumed  most  of  the  Army' s interest and resources for modernization, ongoing contingency operations mandated rapid procurement of key items of equipment. Both the Rapid Equipping Force and the Rapid Fielding Initiative continued to fix vital needs of deployed forces. The Rapid Equipping Force received guidance from  the Army's  G-3/5/7  while  reporting  directly  to  the Vice  Chief  of Staff. The Rapid Equipping Force responded to high-priority requests from operational  units  for  identified  materiel  solutions,  either  by  expediting development of hardware or by purchasing existing commercially available or foreign-built materiel. Close coordination with industry, academia, and related  Defense  Department  and  foreign  agencies  proved  essential  for identifying  quick  solutions  to  such  problems  as  countering  improvised

explosive devices in Iraq. Among this organization' s successes was fielding the PackBot robot for examining caves and suspicious packages that might hold booby traps or other explosive devices.

The  Rapid  Fielding  Initiative  also  responded  to  the  needs  of  the deployed soldier, focusing on individual equipment. Such items include enhanced optics, military operations in urban terrain kit, a new hydration system,  advanced  combat  helmet,  and  modular  sleeping  system.  Since its inception in 2003, this program had equipped five hundred thousand soldiers by early 2006.

Both programs had made major headway in just over three years. The highest  priority  in  2006  was  to  provide  adequate  numbers  of  armored vehicles to defend soldiers against the improvised explosive devices that had proven so deadly in Iraq ( Table 6 ).

The  Buffalo  vehicles  were  the  first  or  what  would  be  called  mineresistant,  ambush-protected  (MRAP)  vehicles  intended  to  augment  and then  replace  up-armored  high-mobility  multipurpose  wheeled  vehicles in  a  theater  with  an  active  mine  or  improvised  explosive  device  threat. The Army had initially distributed these South African-designed vehicles to  engineer  units,  but  expanded  the  requirement  by  the  end  of  2006  to augment and replace at least some of the up-armored light vehicles.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

In 2006, Army family morale, welfare, and recreation programs served 3.9  million  authorized  patrons  and  employed  31,000  civil  service  and nonappropriated fund employees. The budget for 2006 came to $1.7 billion, a $172 million increase from 2005. Of that budget, $949 million came from nonappropriated  funds  generated  at  the  installation  level. Appropriated funds, including for military construction, totaled $762 million. Among other personnel in the enterprise, over fifty civilian personnel had deployed to  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  since  2001  to  promote  fitness  and  recreation services in operational theaters. The Army transformed its organization for welfare and recreation services during the year, and on 16 October 2006, redesignated the Army Community Family Support Center as the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command, a subordinate unit of the Army's Installation Management Command.

## Installation Management

Overshadowing normal installation management issues, several major Defense Department initiatives set the pace of operations. Planning was in full swing to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure law, approved 9 November 2005. Among major actions under the law, the Army would close thirteen major installations over the succeeding six years and merge many reserve-component units into 125 multicomponent reserve centers. The law purportedly prescribed retention of barracks and other facilities for surge capability at U.S. installations for reserve mobilization requirements. More than 150,000 military and civilian personnel would relocate  under  the  law,  which  once  fully  implemented  would  save  $1.5 billion in annual operating costs. The Army anticipated receiving funding from a central Defense Department account to offset many of the upfront military construction costs essential before relocating activities from one installation to another.

Two other Defense Department and Army initiatives sparked further changes to the Army's installations. The integrated global presence and basing strategy directed re-stationing of four brigade combat teams and

two division headquarters from Europe to the continental United States over the next several years, as well one brigade combat team and division headquarters  from  South  Korea.  Conversion  of  operational  units  to  a modular  design  drove  further  requirements  for  military  construction  at affected bases. To pay for these projects, the Army received $2.4 billion in  2006  for  military  construction  and  $972  billion  in  base  realignment and closure funds. Of the military construction funds, the Army National Guard received $327 million and the Army Reserve $106 million. Along with  the  Base  Realignment  and  Closure  actions,  the  two  re-stationing efforts would cost $38 billion through 2013.

## Housing and Infrastructure

Family housing continued to be a major cost for both re-stationing actions and for construction at existing installations. The Army moved to implement the Defense Department's goal of a facilities recapitalization rate  of  sixty-seven  years,  which  would  replace  or  significantly  upgrade facilities older than that point, including  housing.  The  Residential Communities  Initiative  remained  the  keystone  to  modernizing  on-base housing  across  the  Army.  The  2006  budget  provided  $1.3  billion  for family  housing. As  during  the  preceding  years,  the Army' s  Residential Communities Initiative  remained  the  linchpin  of  efforts  to  upgrade  the quality of family housing faster than possible relying solely on traditional military construction processes. Instead, the Army leased land for housing to a commercial developer who built new housing or renovated existing buildings,  then  leased  housing  units  to  soldiers  at  a  rate  not  exceeding their  basic  allowance  for  housing. Through  September  2006,  the Army established  privatized  housing  at  thirty-three installations, including seventy-two residences either built or under construction. By the time this initiative would reach fruition in 2010, the Army will have privatized 90 percent of family housing.

The state  of  bachelor  quarters  also  proved  a  vital  interest  to Army commanders. This was the fourteenth year of a project to provide adequate barracks for soldiers at permanent stations, with the program scheduled to continue through 2009 at a cost of $10 billion. The Army funded 85 percent of this requirement through 2006, including $250 million during the  year.  During  that  period,  the  Defense  Department  improved  the standard for all single soldiers to a '1 + 1' configuration that assigned soldiers to two-bedroom suites, with individual rooms and shared living space and bathroom. Another requirement was modernized barracks for the Army's eighty-one thousand annual trainees, who live in open spaces during basic training. The goal was for 45 percent of these facilities to complete modernization by 2011.

## Safety

The Army lost 240 soldiers to accidents in FY 2006, 49 less than in the previous fiscal year.  The leading cause of death was privately owned vehicle accidents,  which  killed  128,  or  53.3  percent.  Other  ground  accidental deaths included thirty-nine from personal injury, thirty-three from Army motorized vehicles, four from Army combat vehicles, and thirty-two from aviation mishaps. Sixty-two fatalities occurred on duty and one hundred forty-six off duty.

The Army  classified  accidents  by  severity  from  Class A  (damages to government property of $1 million or more and injury resulting in a fatality or permanent total disability), to Class C (damages to government property of $10,000 or more but less than $200,000 and a nonfatal injury that causes any loss of time from work). The Army suffered 234 aviation mishaps, 27 being Class A mishaps, most suffering a destroyed aircraft or fatality. The Army also had 2,316 ground mishaps during the fiscal year, most of which were Class B or Class C accidents.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  provided  a  pillar  of support to service members by providing on-post retail sales (especially at  overseas  locations)  and  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  funds  to  the services. Among overseas locations, exchange volunteer civilian personnel operated 62 retail locations and 184 fast-food outlets in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Approximately 450  volunteers  served  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  alone  during  the  year. Civilian  employees  also  deployed  to  temporary  facilities  in  the  United States during the year in support of firefighting efforts in Washington State and New Mexico, as well as in support of National Guard border defense operations.

In 2006, exchange revenues reached $8.9 billion, $254 million (2.9 percent)  higher  than  during  the  preceding  year.  Of  the  profit,  $231.6 million  went  back  to  service  recreation  programs.  The  Army  received $140.2 million of this dividend.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

As throughout its history, the Army Corps of Engineers remained focused on  the  Army' s  Civil  Works  Program.  Since  1824,  this  responsibility  has encompassed the management of the nation' s inland waterways. Over the years, subsidiary functions have expanded to include ensuring inland and deep-draft navigation, shore protection and flood control, hydropower, aquatic ecosystem protection and restoration, water supply, and recreation. Among the diversity of capabilities required to execute these functions are in-house research and design at several Corps of Engineers laboratories, and coordination with other federal agencies as well as state and local governments.

The Corps of Engineers had requested $4.513 billion for civil works for  FY  2006.  Due  largely  to  supplemental  appropriation  for  hurricane damage relief along the Gulf Coast, the Corps received $6.964 billion for the year. Civil works consumed most of the effort of the Corps' thirtyfour thousand civil service employees during the year, and a considerable number of contractors working on projects.

The big jolt to ongoing civil works and other domestic engineering programs  during  the  year  resulted  from  protracted  hurricane  relief requirements.  Over  eight  thousand  Corps  employees  deployed  to  the affected region to undertake relief efforts and reconstruction. As the chief of engineers noted, Hurricane Katrina alone affected nearly 93,000 square miles,  an  area  approximately  the  size  of  Great  Britain. The  main  relief effort  focused  on  the  city  of  New  Orleans,  which  at  one  point  was  80 percent submerged. In fifty-three days, the Army' s engineers conducted emergency  repairs  to  the  city' s  levee  system  and  pumped  238  billion gallons  from  the  city,  enabling  the  repair  of  169  miles  of  levees  and floodwalls. The Corps also coordinated the removal of 52 million cubic yards of debris in Mississippi and Louisiana. Recovery and repair work continued during the year.

## Environmental Protection

The Army  budgeted  $402.8  million  for  environmental  restoration work in 2006. During the year, the Army's assistant chief of staff  for

installation management took a significant step toward reducing waste at installations.  One  change  mandated  as  a  contract  performance  requirement was that future construction contracts would require recycling or salvage of at least 50 percent of construction and demolition debris. The Army generated 1.4 million tons of debris in 2004 and could deconstruct such materials  as  wood  beams,  metals,  and  concrete  masonry  for  reuse  in other projects.

The Army's installation managers faced a different problem in the years ahead. Over the succeeding twenty years, more than one hundred thousand  buildings  in  the  Defense  Department  that  had  been  built during the Cold War would turn fifty years old. Buildings this age or older are subject to the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act.  Modifications  to  such  buildings  may  involve  more  extensive consultation,  costs,  and  likely  project  delays  in  order  to  comply  with the  letter  of  the  law. The Army' s  installation  managers  developed  the Army Historic Preservation Campaign Plan in response to this looming requirement. The buildings requiring immediate action were the more than  nineteen  thousand  family  housing  units  from  the  Capehart  and Wherry era built in the 1950s. The solution in this case was to standardize treatment measures across the Army and to integrate these units into the

Residential Communities Initiative. The Army's assistant chief of staff for installation management continued to develop a plan for the Army's ammunition plants and ammunition storage facilities through the end of the fiscal year.

Another  highly  visible  environmental  issue  concerned  preservation and restoration of landscape. As the Army was a significant landlord in many states, communities took an understandable interest in stewardship of land, flora, and fauna. In addition to actions that minimized the impact of  vehicles  and  ordnance  on  training  areas  and  ranges,  in  many  cases, installations had to engage in remediation activities to repair damage. One concern was to ensure that not only replanted vegetation would grow fast and be durable,  but  also  that  native  species  are  used  to  avoid  potential future environmental problems. Another major concern was to minimize soil  erosion  and  runoff  that  might  pollute  local  watersheds,  as  well  as to  take  steps  at  installations  to  enhance  water  conservation  and  reduce consumption, primarily by means of innovative building designs.

## Legal Affairs

During the fiscal year, twenty-one active-component military judges, one  mobilized  Army  Reserve  military  judge,  and  thirteen  reservecomponent military judges presided over all but two of the general and special  courts-martial.  A  Marine  Corps  military  judge  presided  over two  detainee  abuse  cases. The Army  tried  144  of  these  cases  overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The U.S. Army Trial Defense Service, with  approximately  130  active-component  and  187  reserve-component attorneys,  provided  defense  services  to  defendants  at  every  general  or special  court-martial  during  the  year.  In  addition  to  courts-martial,  the Army imposed nonjudicial punishment in 42,814 cases in FY 2006. With an average active-duty strength of 574,456 soldiers during the year, this figure yielded a rate of 74.53 per thousand soldiers ( Table 7 ).

The  Army  Judge  Advocate  General's  Criminal  Law  Division  kept busy during the year with general and special courts-martial and several procedural  issues.  The  review  of  28  officer  dismissal  actions  and  the response to 150 White House and congressional inquiries were some of the  procedural  issues.  Review  of  the  proposed  legislation  for  military commissions constituted perhaps the division' s most visible activity. After passage of the Military Commission Act of 2006, Army judge advocates served as members of a Defense Department working group that drafted and  reviewed  implementing  directives  for  military  commissions.  This group would develop procedural and evidentiary rules for commissions to try suspected terrorists or war criminals. Finally, this division also tracked

approximately  eight  hundred  investigations  concerning  possible  abuse of U.S.-controlled battlefield detainees for alleged offenses that included assaults  on  detainees  and  leadership  or  supervisory  failures  of  those overseeing detainee operations.

The Army Clerk of Court handled over 1,200 records of trial and 4,400 motions and briefs submitted for review by the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. The Government Appellate Division filed 1,138 briefs with the Army Court of Criminal Appeals and 17 briefs with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Army appellate attorneys argued the government' s position in 17 cases before the Army Court and 16 before the Court of Appeals. The Defense Appellate Division filed 1,000 briefs in support of convicted appellants in the Army Court and 400 supplements to petitions for  review  by  the  Court  of Appeals,  and  15  final  briefs  for  that  body. Appellate defense counsel argued 14 cases before the Army Court and 12 cases before the Court of Appeals.

The Army had 1,638 judge advocates in the active component at the end of the fiscal year, an increase of 35 over the preceding year. Another 63 officers were attending law school as part of the funded legal education program. The Army  Reserve  had  2,765  judge  advocates  and  the Army National Guard 569 at the end of the year.

## Reviews and Inspections

As  during  most  of  the  Army' s  history,  the  Office  of  the  Inspector General remained at the forefront of monitoring the pulse of organizations' readiness and  efficiency.  The subordinate  inspector general agency conducted  numerous  investigations  around  the  world  wherever  Army organizations were stationed or serving in an operational theater. Two of the most significant investigations in 2006 involved detainee operations,

with  inspectors  interviewing  over  one  thousand  personnel  in  fourteen locations in the continental United States and sixteen locations overseas. Other significant investigations focused on the Army' s Physical Disability Evaluation  System  and  deployment  mental  health  screening,  which remained ongoing at the end of the year. After  adverse  news  reporting on problems suffered by wounded soldiers at the Army's medical centers received  national  attention,  investigations  focused  on  compliance  with policies and regulations. Other issues that received attention included the Army's medical hold system, the suicide prevention program, the physical disability  evaluation  system,  and  soldier  awareness  and  availability  of mental health programs.

While  the  Global  War  on  Terrorism  occupied  much  of  the  Army inspector  general' s  efforts  during  the  year,  other  recurrent  peacetime inspections also required attention. Among the more significant of these were technical inspections of the Army' s nuclear, biological, and chemical surety programs. During the year, the inspector general' s office conducted two biological and ten chemical surety inspections.

In  addition  to  the  inspector  general' s  assessments,  the Army Audit Agency conducted inspections and investigations during the year focused on financial management and contracting issues. For instance, the agency reported  in  2006  that  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  needed  to  improve  program management of its general support reconstitution maintenance program, and  recommended  corrective  efforts  to  monitor  the  actual  costs  of maintenance  activities.  In  the  same  theater,  the  auditors  also  examined the state of Army Pre-positioned Stocks in Europe, noting that two of six projects  'would not effectively support responsibilities in the European theater and Army transformation goals.'

Back in the United States, the auditors conducted many of the same type of evaluations as overseas, as well as those concerning major procurement projects. One audit agency report examined the current logistical support contract for the Stryker vehicles. It noted that although the contract had sufficient  incentives  to  ensure  needed  services,  that  contract  failed  to provide sufficient incentives for the contractor to control costs. Potential life-cycle  costs  for  logistical  support  of  the  Stryker  remained  murky, however, as the Army lacked sufficient information to estimate costs of future logistical support, or evaluate support alternatives.

In  addition  to  the  scope  of  military  inspections  and  management audits,  the  Army  also  conducted  investigations  of  suspected  criminal activity.  The  U.S.  Army  Criminal  Investigation  Command  conducted investigative,  intelligence,  and  protective  services,  relying  primarily  on uniformed agents. At the end of the year, 120 agents were deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the world in support of contingency operations. In the overseas theaters, criminal investigators worked closely

in  particular  with  military  intelligence  personnel  to  close  gaps  between foreign and counterintelligence information and law enforcement information in the fight against global terrorism. Agents also supported the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization in its efforts to identify perpetrators, manufacturing points, supply routes, and financing of insurgents who employed these devices in Afghanistan and Iraq.

A major Defense Department initiative in the Global War on Terrorism involved  investigators  from  all  services. The  Criminal  Investigation Task Force combined law enforcement personnel with attorneys and support staff. Working overseas with existing courts in Iraq and supporting potential trials by military commissions or civilian trials in the United States, the task force sought to investigate possible war crimes in overseas theaters. The main goal was to develop prosecutable trial reports for suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The task force also supported the Central Criminal Court of Iraq by providing information that contributed to sixteen successful prosecutions before that court by the end of the fiscal year.

## 9 Conclusion

Prosecuting the Global War on Terrorism provided the most serious challenge to the Army during the year. Although combat operations had ostensibly ended in  Afghanistan in 2002, and Iraq the next year, insurgencies in both countries had begun to expand by 2006. Both casualties and overall costs increased as U.S. and allied forces responded to expanding hostilities. The costs of expanding Afghan and Iraqi military and police forces further strained the U.S. defense budget.

Despite  the  concentration  on  operations,  peacetime  workload  for the  Army  headquarters  continued  unabated.  The  Army's  top  leaders still had to translate national strategic goals into military requirements. Headquarters,  Department  of  the Army,  converted  these  requirements into  discrete  programs  as  part  of  the  Defense  Department' s  planning, programming, and budgeting system. Many of these programs maintained the readiness of Army forces to fill the Defense Department's contingency plans. The Army Force Generation model was one outcome of  this  planning  that  stabilized  Army  units  in  a  rotational  cycle  that supported  deployments.  The  high  tempo  of  unit  rotations  further tested the Army's ability to transfer equipment and personnel between deploying  and  returning  units  to  support  operations. The  goal  was  to accomplish rotations without severely damaging the ability of any unit to reconstitute for future deployment. Another major readiness program was the  resetting  or  rehabilitation  of  equipment  that  was  damaged  or heavily used in overseas operations.

While maintaining readiness, the Army also sought to transform the force  for  the  future. The  transition  to  modular  organizations  continued during the year, marked by success in the reorganization of fixed divisions into  more  flexible  brigade  combat  teams. The  Stryker  Brigade  Combat Teams also  offer  a  successful  example  of  transformation  in  the  United States and in service overseas. The Future Combat Systems remained an ambitious  comprehensive  modernization  program  for  the Army' s  heavy forces. Having been recently restructured, the program was poised to enter a  critical  stage  of  risky  development. Nonetheless, innovation remained critical to the Army' s future despite competing with operations and efforts to retain a ready force for the near term.
