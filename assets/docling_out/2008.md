## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2008

## 1 Introduction

In fiscal year (FY) 2008, the U.S. Army struggled with the demands of  the  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  and  extensive  modernization, restructuring,  and  expansion  programs,  at  a  time  of  great  economic difficulties at home and government divisions over key policy issues. While it was the last year of President George W . Bush' s administration, it was the first year of General George W . Casey Jr.' s tenure as chief of staff of the Army. After taking office in April 2007, Casey and his staff had spent a few months analyzing the Army's development  in  relation  to  world history  since  the  end  of  the  Cold War,  and  how  the  service  and  the planet  might  change  over  the  next couple of decades. They determined that  the  world  was  in  the  midst  of an 'era of persistent conflict,' and that because of population growth, the increasing interconnectivity of cultures due to information technologies,  and  competition  for scarce  resources,  the  Army  could expect no diminution in the demand for its services. In addition, because of the increased pace of operations since terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, the Army was currently 'out of balance,' with insufficient recovery time for personnel, families, and equipment; inadequate training for missions other than counterinsurgency; and an overtaxed reserve component.

To address these problems, the Army leadership decided to focus on four  imperatives:  to  sustain  the  force  through  recruiting  incentives  and programs to improve the quality of life; to prepare it through better training and equipment; to reset it by providing more stability in deployments and dwell time; and to transform it through expanding its size and modernizing its equipment and structure.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Reorganizations and Realignments

On 19 December 2007, the  Army announced a major stationing plan that combined the requirements of three ongoing transformation programs: the 'Grow the Army' initiative to add 74,200 personnel across the entire force by FY 2010; the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) directive to close and consolidate military installations around the world; and modular transformation, an Army effort begun in 2004 to convert the force from a fixed division-based structure to one of smaller, interchangeable brigadesized units. The service' s leaders expected the combined changes to result in the re-stationing of nearly one-third of the Army' s total force by 2011. This was the service' s largest reorganization since World War II. Under the plan, the Army was creating six new active-component infantry brigade combat teams, bringing the service' s total to forty-eight. It also planned to relocate two larger formations from Germany to the continental United States by September 2011: the 1st Armored Division, which would move to Fort Bliss, Texas, and the 1st Infantry Division, which would relocate to Fort Riley, Kansas, and to Fort Knox, Kentucky. In the short term, the Army expected to replace the divisions with two new heavy brigade combat teams between 2012 and 2013. In addition to combat units, the Army also planned to create eight active modular component support brigades and re-station two others.

In response to the growing strategic importance of Africa, on 1 October 2007  the  United  States  created  a  new  subunified  combatant  command for the continent, Africa Command, or AFRICOM, which was slated to become a fully operational combatant command by October 2008. The new command included a small staff under the leadership of U.S. Army General  William  E.  'Kip'  Ward,  former  deputy  commander  of  U.S. European Command (EUCOM), and it was temporarily headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, while it looked for a permanent location. The facilities in Stuttgart were owned and operated by the U.S. Army, and the secretary of defense had made the Army responsible for the $250 million in expected costs during the year.


In  creating  AFRICOM,  the  U.S.  government  hoped  to  improve military coordination in the region. It also wanted to relieve EUCOM and Central  Command  (CENTCOM),  which  had  been  shouldering  most  of the U.S. civil and military operations on the continent, while struggling to  balance  their  significant  duties  in  the  wars  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan. The new command was expected to devote significant resources to nonmilitary activities, such as stability operations and training partnerships with local forces. Many of these activities had been overseen by EUCOM and CENTCOM before FY 2008 but were being reassigned to AFRICOM during the year.

Unlike other combatant commands, AFRICOM was not expected to have any dedicated military forces. Instead, the command was supposed to  function  as  a  staff  headquarters  and  to  request  manpower  from  the Department  of  Defense  for  exercises  and  missions.  Defense  officials had planned to assign about thirteen hundred people to its headquarters staff, with each service providing between one hundred and two hundred personnel, but by the end of the fiscal year it had only been able to fill three-quarters of these slots. In addition, the command could use thirtyfive hundred U.S. forces already on the continent, including four hundred forty Army personnel from Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa with headquarters in Djibouti.

## Budget

The  Bush  administration  submitted  its  FY  2008  budget  request  to Congress  in  February  2007. The  budget  included  $130  billion  in  total obligation authority for the Army, $19.9 billion more than in FY 2007. Along  with  this  amount,  the  administration  submitted  a  supplemental request  to  help  fund  its  operations  in  the  Global  War  on  Terrorism (GWOT), principally  related  to  the  wars  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan. That request  came  to  $83.4  billion,  $7.2  billion  less  than  the  year  before. The budget focused on the service's requirement to provide trained and equipped forces to combatant commanders, while balancing the needs of soldiers  and  their  families  and  continuing  to  reorganize  and  modernize the  force  to  meet  immediate  and  future  demands. Among its  important priorities  were  to  increase  significantly  the Army' s  end  strength  for  all components; to provide pay raises for uniformed and civilian personnel; to transform units into modular design; to re-station units as required by national strategic needs; to stabilize rotation schedules for soldiers; and to improve support services for them and their families. The budget also emphasized  improvements  in  training;  efforts  to  align  Army  National Guard and Army Reserve units to make them modular and interchangeable with those in the active component; modernization of equipment through programs such as the Future Combat Systems (FCS) and Army aviation; maintaining and recapitalizing equipment; and developing a force capable of a full spectrum of operations, including counterinsurgency.

Despite these needs, when FY 2008 began the Army did not have an appropriation.  Because  of  differences  within  Congress  over  fiscal  and Iraq  War  policies,  the  legislature  passed  a  temporary  measure  to  fund the Department of Defense for forty-five days at FY 2007 levels. Army leaders,  however,  pushed  hard  for  a  permanent  budget,  noting  that  the service based most of its equipment and support services on long-term contracts. The lack of regular funding, they added, made it difficult to do advanced planning and cost the service money.

On 13 November, just days before temporary funding was set to expire, Congress passed the president' s base budget request for the year and an additional  $11.6  billion  to  purchase  mine-resistant,  ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles. The base budget, however, did not include $189.3 billion that  the  administration  had  requested  between  February  and  October 2007 to fund all U.S. activities as part of the Global War on Terrorism. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates warned in a press conference on 15 November that if the additional funds were not provided by mid-February 2008, the Department would have to cease war operations and furlough nearly  two  hundred  thousand  civilian  employees  and  contractors.  In addition, on 20 November the Department had to transfer $4.5 billion from other accounts to the Army and to the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization -a Department of Defense group that  looked  into  innovative  ways to  deal  with  improvised  explosive devices -to keep both operating.

Secretary Gates

On 26 December, Congress completed work on a broad appropriations bill that included $86.8 billion of the Bush administration' s $189.3 billion request for GWOT. To compensate for the shortfall, the Bush administration submitted an emergency request on 2 May 2008 for  a  $70  billion  bridge  fund  to cover  these  expenses  through  the end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Congress, however, reworked the legislation and added another $65.9 billion to cover war operations for all the services through about July 2009 to provide the next  presidential  administration  with  enough  funds  while  it  developed its  policies  on  Iraq  and Afghanistan.  Congress  also  added  a  number  of domestic provisions to the bill and funding for new educational benefits for veterans. The president signed the appropriation on 30 June.

On 4 February 2008, the Bush administration submitted to Congress its FY 2009 budget request of $515.4 billion for day-to-day operations of the Department of Defense. Congress reworked the Defense Department base budget and authorized $477.6 billion, which it incorporated into the FY 2009 Consolidated Security, Disaster and Continuing Appropriations Act (Public Law 110 -329). President Bush signed the bill on 30 September.

## Management

The Army  continued  its  efforts  to  expand  strategic  leadership  and business  practices  across  the  service. Two  organizations-the  Office  of the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1,  Human  Resources  Command,  and  the Program  Executive  Office,  Enterprise  Information  System-produced a memorandum of agreement to cooperate on installing the Department of Defense's new military personnel and pay management system for the Army, the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System. It was

expected to free financial personnel from payroll functions and to allow them to focus on their core financial management missions. It was also expected to provide more security, accuracy, and flexibility, and to assist  the  Army  in  its  conversion to a modular  force.  The  offices conducted tests of the system during  the year and  planned  to fully  implement it in March 2009, making  the Army  the  first  service to  do  so.  The  Army  also  worked toward establishing the General Fund Enterprise Business System, a Web-enabled planning tool that will allow  the Army to  share  financial, asset,  and  accounting  data  among more  than  seventy-nine  thousand users at more than two hundred Army financial centers around the world. The Army planned to field the system first at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in October 2008 and to expand it to all of its southeastern U.S. installations during FY 2009.

To  ensure  that  the  force  was  acquainted  with  modern  business methods, in August 2007, Secretary of the Army Preston M. 'Pete' Geren III  had  established  the  Commission  on Army Acquisition  and  Program Management  in  Expeditionary  Operations  to  examine  the  contracting lessons learned from the U.S. military' s deployment to Iraq.  The commission was headed by Jacques S. Gansler, former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. In October, the commission issued its  report, Urgent  Reform  Required:  Army  Expeditionary  Contracting , which  detailed  many  problems  with  the Army' s  contracting  system.  In response, the Army established the U.S. Army Contracting Command in March 2008 to oversee the service' s contracting practices and to implement the commission's recommendations. By the end of the year, the service had  implemented  all  but  one  of  the  recommended  changes,  and  it  was working on implementing the last, to add four hundred military and one thousand civilians to the contracting workforce.

## Army Strength

By the end of fiscal year 2008, the Army' s total force stood at 1,097,050, an increase of 36,678 from 2007. Of this sum, 49 percent or 539,675 were in the active component, an increase of 21,892 soldiers from the end of FY 2007. The component consisted of 72,928 commissioned officers, 14,682 warrant officers, and 452,065 enlistees. Reflecting the diversity of the force, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and other minorities made up 37.3 percent of the active members, and women represented 13.6 percent.

The Army National Guard also grew. By year's end, the component had added 7,644 members to achieve a total strength of 360,351, roughly 33  percent  of  the Army' s  total  force. The  component  contained  31,685 commissioned  officers,  7,061  warrant  officers,  and  321,605  enlistees. As with the Regular Army, the Guard was also diverse: 25.6 percent of guardsmen were from minorities and 14.1 percent were women.

At 197,024, the Army Reserve comprised 18 percent of the Army's overall  force  at  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  and  it  had  increased  its membership by 7,142 since 2007. Of the total, 33,184 were commissioned officers and 2,837 were warrant officers. The Army Reserve had an even higher proportion of minority members than its sister components, 40.3 percent, and a larger share of women, 23.8 percent.

## Enlisted Personnel

FYs 2005 to 2007 had been difficult years for Army recruitment and retention. Historically low U.S. unemployment rates, negative news about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and war-related stresses, such as unusually lengthy and multiple deployments as well as increased casualties, had drawn people away from the service.  Additionally, the  Army had begun an ambitious expansion effort in 2007, requiring it to increase its recruitment and retention quotas at a time when fewer people were joining or remaining in the service. By the beginning of FY 2008, however, the Army had implemented a number of policies to reverse these downward trends. The service added twenty-five hundred recruiters to identify and locate potential enlistees,  increased  its advertising budget, raised the maximum age for enlistment from thirty-five

| Active Army         | 80,000 | 80,517   |             100.7 |
| Army National Guard | 63,000 | 65,192   |             103.5 |
| Army Reserve        | 37,500 | 39,870   |             106.3 |

to forty-two, loosened some personal grooming standards, and doubled the basic enlistment bonus to $40,000. The service also increased the portion of waivers for recruits who had been convicted of offenses prior to enlisting, such as drug use, traffic violations, misdemeanors, or felonies, from 12.5 percent  in  FYs  2003  and  2004  to  22  percent  in  FY  2007. These  efforts, combined with a downturn in the economy in 2008 and a reduction in the pace of operations in Iraq, enabled the Army to exceed its recruiting goals for all three components, as shown in Table 2.

Another  way  the  Army  managed  to  maintain  troop  levels  through 2008  was  by  stop-loss,  a  rule  under  which  the  service  could  retain  a soldier who is within ninety days of his or her discharge if the soldier' s unit was scheduled for deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Under the rule, the soldier would then be obligated to remain in the service until ninety days after his or her unit redeployed to its home station. The policy was controversial and added to morale problems within the Army. The use of stop-loss increased after the Bush administration decided in January 2007 to send five additional combat brigades to Iraq. The number of soldiers retained under the policy increased from 8,540 in May 2007 to 12,230 in May 2008. Army leaders hoped to discontinue stop-loss once the size of the force increased and operational demands decreased.

Along with its recruiting successes in 2008, the service also began reversing  a  decline  in  quality.  In  FY  2007,  only  79  percent  of  activecomponent recruits had high school diplomas and only 61 percent scored above average on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (a standardized test given to enrollees and high school students). A year later, 83 percent of the new recruits had diplomas and 62 percent scored above average on the qualification exam. The Guard also saw improvements. The number of new members who scored above average on the qualifications test increased from 57 percent in FY 2007 to 59 percent, and those with a high school diploma went from 83 percent in FY 2005 to a steady 91 percent from FYs 2006 to 2008. In a countervailing trend, the number of Army Reserve

Source: Recruiting and Retention: An Overview of FY2008 and FY2009 Results for Active and Reserve Component Enlisted Personnel, Congressional Research Service, November 2009.

recruits with high school diplomas remained steady between FYs 2005 and 2008 at 88 percent, and those scoring above average on the qualifications exam decreased from 67 percent in 2005 to 58 percent in 2008.

Beside recruitment, the service experienced a shortage of noncommissioned officers during 2008. This was due in part to its expansion under the 2007 Grow the Army initiative, its need for more noncommissioned officers  to  man  brigade  combat  teams  as  the  force  transitioned  from  a division-based to a modular structure, and a rise in the number of experienced soldiers leaving the Army between 2005 and 2007. To redress this shortage, the service reduced some of the requirements for promotion to and within sergeant ranks. In 2005, it made soldiers at the rank of E-4 automatically eligible for promotion after seven years of service. In April 2008, it placed all E-5s who had served at least seven years in the service and at least one year as an E-5 automatically on the promotion list to E-6. Commanders were responsible for screening out unqualified soldiers from the various promotion lists. As a result, while 40,000 to 45,000 soldiers on average received promotions to the ranks of E-5 to E-9 prior to 2005, some 52,400 enlisted personnel did so in 2008.

The Army  also  retained  more  soldiers  in  FY  2008. Table  3  shows retention rates for initial-term soldiers (those serving their first enlistment, regardless of length), mid-career soldiers (those in second or subsequent enlistments with less than ten years of service), and career soldiers (those in second or subsequent enlistments with ten or more years of service).

## Officer Personnel

The active component added 7,494 officers and 1,632 warrant officers in  2008. The Army  National  Guard  brought  on  4,053  officers  and  993 warrant officers, while 3,992 officers and 396 warrant officers joined the Army Reserve.

The Army's retention rate for lieutenants and captains in FY 2008 was similar to its average, about 92 percent, but the service's leaders believed they would need an additional 3,500 captains and majors to meet  their  force  expansion  goals.  In  addition,  the  stresses  and  long deployments created by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were expected to hamper officer retention. The need was most acute for captains, who would  be  required  to  help  man  the  Army's  newly  forming  modular units. To  entice  more  mid-grade  officers  to  remain  in  the  force,  the Army  initiated  a  program  in  September  2007  known  as  the  Officer Retention Menu  of  Incentives. It targeted 17,309  captains who received their commissions between 1999 and 2004 and served in the following  branches:  adjutant,  air  defense,  armor,  aviation,  chemical, engineering, field artillery, finance, infantry, military police, ordnance, quartermaster, signal, and transportation. Based on military specialty and induction year, the program offered officers one of five options in exchange for service obligations of one to three years: a cash bonus of  $25,000-$35,000,  the  ability  to  attend  the  Army  Ranger  School or the Defense Language Institute, one's choice of home installation, full  funding for a graduate school program, or the ability to transfer to a branch or function area of one's choice. By the end of the fiscal year, the service had approved nearly 15,000 captains for the program, most of whom chose the cash bonus option. In addition to the captain incentives, the Army continued a program begun in 2006 to allow cadets at the U.S. Military Academy and Reserve Officers' Training Corps to select a branch or post, or to attend graduate school in exchange for an additional service obligation of three years. Nearly 4,500 candidates had participated by the end of 2008.

## Civilian Personnel

During FY 2008, the Army maintained a large civilian corps that provided critical services to the force and the nation. At the close of the fiscal year, it employed 261,488 civilians, an increase of 15,889 from the same time the year before. This total included 7,553 foreign nationals hired directly by the Army and 16,649 foreign nationals that it employed through  contracts  or  special  agreements  with  other  countries.  Total civilian  pay  exceeded  $60  billion,  including  a  2.5  percent  across-theboard salary increase in January 2008 that, with adjustments for local salary scales, averaged 3.5 percent in the continental United States.

In  the  FY  2008  National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  Congress directed the Department of Defense to consider converting both new and  existing  functions  performed  by  contractors  to  civilian  slots,  a process termed 'in-sourcing.' It also instructed the department to focus

on converting positions that had been performed by civilians at some point over the previous decade, that were inherently governmental, that had been handled under noncompetitive contracts, and that had been performed under contracts that were excessive, costly, or had provided inferior quality. By July, the Army had created 585 positions under the new rules, each position saving about $48,000 per year.

On 11 July 2008, the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff chartered  the  Army  Civilian  University  to  improve  functional  and leadership  training  and  education  for  civilians.  Initially,  the  Army made the  university  an  element  of  Headquarters,  Department  of  the Army, but it planned eventually to make the university a subordinate element of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), where  it  would  report  to  the  commanding  general  of  the  Combined Arms Center. The new institution, with headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was  manned  by  twenty-one  professionals.  It  would  be responsible for implementing the Army's Civilian Education System, a collection of five leadership courses offered concurrently at the Fort Belvoir  and  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas,  campuses;  it  would  oversee the  development  of  online  training  programs;  and  it  would  work  to incorporate other civilian development programs into its own. It also established governance forums for each aspect of civilian training and education, and it created a standing council of Army Senior Executive Service executives to oversee the development of continuing education curriculum for senior executives.

The Department of Defense, including the military services, scaled back  efforts  to  restructure  the  civilian  personnel  system.  In  2005, the  Department  had  begun  planning  to  convert  the  existing  system, which was based in part on seniority, with one that the secretary of defense and Bush administration officials believed would emphasize merit and would allow managers more flexibility to hire, fire, transfer personnel, limit collective bargaining rights, and restrict the ability to appeal disciplinary actions. This plan was called the National Security Personnel System. The plan ran into problems almost immediately. A coalition of federal workers groups filed suit against the plan, forcing the  Department  to  delay  implementation.  In  addition,  reports  in  the press  and  from  Congress  in  2008  indicated  that  the  new  system,  as the Department was implementing it, had favored certain groups over others and that many employees felt it was unfair. Finally, in January 2008, Congress included language in the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization  Act  that  restored  collective  bargaining  rights.  As  a result, in September the Defense Department announced that it would only convert 205,000 nonunion personnel to the new system, leaving most of the remaining 475,000 civil servants under the existing rules.



## Medal of Honor

Private McGinnis

Two  Medals  of  Honor  were awarded in 2008. On 28 June, Pfc. Ross  A.  McGinnis,  1st  Platoon, Company  C,  1st  Battalion,  26th Infantry Regiment, 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, received the award posthumously for his actions during combat  operations  in  Adhamiyah, northeast Baghdad, Iraq, on 4 December 2006. On that day, Private McGinnis was manning an M2 .50-caliber machine gun when a  grenade  was  thrown  through  the gunner's  hatch. The  nineteen-yearold  McGinnis  shouted  to  alert  the crew  and  then  used  his  body  to smother the grenade against the vehicle wall and protect his four crewmates from death or serious injury. He died of his injuries.



On 3  March,  M.  Sgt.  Woodrow  W .  Keeble  was  posthumously  awarded  the Medal of Honor for actions during the  Korean  War.  On  20  October 1951, on Hill 765 near Sangsan-ni, Korea,  Sergeant  Keeble,  an  acting support platoon leader in Company G, 2d Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment,  24th  Infantry  Division, saw  the  company's  lead  platoon become pinned down by fire from three fortified enemy positions. Acting on his own, Keeble moved forward  to  join  the  platoon.  He then proceeded single-handedly to  attack  each  of  the  positions  in turn, eliminating them and opening the  way  for  the  company  to  seize its  objective. He was the first fullblooded Sioux Indian to receive the medal. He died on 28 January 1982. Sergeant Keeble



## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Army Force Generation

Army  Force  Generation,  more  commonly  known  by  the  acronym ARFORGEN,  was  a  readiness,  training,  and  deployment  model  that the Army had introduced in  2006.  In  contrast  to  the  'tiered  readiness' concept of the Cold War era, in which the service allocated personnel, equipment, and training to units based on their priority levels in a preset campaign plan, ARFORGEN called for all units to go through predictable cycles of deployment, reset, and readiness. ( See Diagram. ) In this way, the Army would have a set number of units ready for deployment to a variety of  missions  at  any  given  time.  It  would  also  provide  soldiers  and  their families with a few months' notice of their next station, thereby affording them more stability in their lives. By FY 2008, the model included the following three cycles:

- 1. Reset/Train Force Pool-units redeploying from theater would repair  and  update  their  existing  equipment  and  receive  new items, they would be assigned new personnel, and they would begin  training. The  units  would  also  be  available  to  support civil authorities for national emergencies.
- 2. Ready Force Pool-units prepare for their upcoming missions and  conduct  collective  training.  They  would  be  eligible  for deployment  in  case  of  unanticipated  contingencies  or  other operational requirements.
- 3. Available Force Pool-units would be fully retrained and reset and would be available for worldwide deployment.

Because of the increase in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan since the program began and Army enlargement efforts, the service was not able to  implement ARFORGEN fully in FY 2008. Instead  of  receiving  two years at home stations for every year deployed, as originally conceived, service members were getting one year at home for every twelve to fifteen months in theater. To adjust the model to these demands, in December

2007 General Casey directed the service to begin a series of 'reset test pilots'  to  determine  if  it  could  fully  reset  active-component  units  with fresh and restored equipment, new personnel, and proper training within six months, and if it could do the same for Guard and Reserve units within twelve  months. As  of  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  thirteen  units  that  had redeployed from theater -eight from the active component and five from the  Guard  and  Reserve -were  involved  in  the  pilots.  Additionally,  the Army was working to improve its training facilities and to synchronize their schedules with the ARFORGEN model. It also had begun developing mobile training teams to bring instruction in military occupation specialties, the Army's Advanced Noncommissioned Officer Course, and the Basic Noncommissioned Officer Course to individual unit home stations.

## Modular Transformation

In  2004,  then-Army  Chief  of  Staff  General  Peter  J.  Schoomaker ordered the service to begin converting its division-based force structure, with  large  fixed  formations  of  10,000  to  18,000  soldiers,  to  a  smaller, more nimble force based on specialized modular brigade combat teams of less than 3,900. Commanders could assemble these brigades together for  specific  joint  or  international  missions. As  of  2008,  the Army  was

planning to convert 300 units by the time the process was to end in 2019, including  73  combat  brigades  and  227  multifunctional  and  functional support units. In 2008 alone, it formed thirty-two new modular brigades, seven in the active component and twenty-five in the reserve component, and it converted fourteen older brigades (five active and nine reserve) into modular form. The converted brigades were included in the new stationing plan that Army leaders had announced in December 2007.

## Electronic Warfare

On 18 July 2008, the U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff, General Richard A.  Cody,  approved  a  plan,  known  as  a  Force  Development  Update,  to upgrade the service' s own electronic warfare capabilities. Before then, the Army had to rely on the Air Force and Navy to conduct offensive electronic operations, such as jamming an enemy's radio spectrum, suppressing its radar, or disabling its global positioning system satellite technology, while the Army had a small program that trained a limited number of soldiers in techniques to counter improvised explosive devices. Under the plan enacted in July, the Army expected to create a 29-series career field for electronic warfare operators and officers, and to train over fifteen hundred soldiers from sergeant grades and above in the art. The new field would be divided into three categories: Electronic Attack, Electronic Protect, and Electronic Warfare Support. A new field manual (FM) 3-36, Electronic Warfare in Operations , was in preparation to provide the doctrinal underpinnings of the new career field.

## Training and Development

On  21  December  2007,  General  Casey  signed  a  memorandum establishing an  Army Leadership Development Program, with headquarters at Fort Leavenworth. The program was to improve the quality of leader development and to improve the coordination of curricula and resources across  the  service.  The  charter  designated  the  commanding  general  of TRADOC as the  single  responsible  official  for  all  leader  development initiatives throughout all parts and components of the Army.

Along  with  leader  development,  the  service' s  four  Army  Combat Training Centers provided joint and combined arms collective training. The Battle Command Training Program at Fort Leavenworth focused on leader development for corps, division, and brigade commanders and their staffs. At  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana,  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center  primarily developed infantry  brigade  combat  teams. The  National Training  Center, Fort Irwin, California, worked primarily with mechanized brigade combat teams. In Hohenfels, Germany, the Joint Multi-National Readiness Center

trained  brigade  combat  teams  in  Europe.  Since  2003,  the  centers  have been reconfiguring to replicate conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan, adding improvised  explosive  device  lanes,  tunnel  and  cave  complexes,  walled compounds,  buildings  and  shantytowns  populated  with  Iraqi  or  Afghan natives, and forward operating bases. In 2008, the Army approved several initiatives, including creation of overseas and stateside-based training teams equipped with the latest training equipment to prepare those brigades that were unable to attend one of the training centers.  Also, the service restructured the Brigade Combat Training Center Program, including twenty simulationdriven exercises for combat headquarters, twenty-one support brigades, and fifteen theater/expeditionary support brigades.

## Doctrine

The Army issued a number of major doctrinal publications during the fiscal year. One of the most important was a revision of its fundamental guidebook, FM 3 -0, Operations ,  which  it  released  on  27  February  and had  last  been  updated  in  June  2001.  Reflecting  lessons  learned  since 2003  from  Operations IraqI  Freedom and endurIng  Freedom ,  as  well as  the  humanitarian  response  operations  to  Hurricanes  Katrina  and Rita,  the  revised  edition  made  post-conflict  stability  operations  coequal to offensive and defensive operations, and it provided details on how to conduct specific tactical tasks to accomplish these missions, such as civil security  and  governance,  developing  infrastructure,  and  restoring  basic services. In a break with the earlier edition, which instructed soldiers to avoid  population  centers,  the  new  manual  assumed  that  soldiers  would have  to  fight  among  civilians,  and  it  instructed  them  to  use  carefully calculated amounts of force for each task and to emphasize precision over destructive  power.  It  also  stressed  the  importance  of  cooperating  with other government institutions and indigenous forces; the need for soldiers to be able to handle complex, full-spectrum operations; and the need to find non-military answers to conflicts. Along with FM 3 -0, on 28 January the Army released FM 3 -0.1, The Modular Force , which updated a 2004 edition and reflected how implementation of full-spectrum operations and the experiences of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan would affect modular brigades. By the close of the year, the service was also nearing completion of FM 3 -07, Stability Operations , which would provide personnel with a more detailed delineation of how to conduct stability missions.

The service issued a number of other significant doctrinal publications. FM 1 01, -Generating Force Support for Operations , was released in April and  provided  the  fundamental  definitions  and  principles,  and  identified the operational capabilities the Army would use to generate force. Issued on  29  August,  FM  6 -01.1, Knowledge  Management  Section ,  provided

doctrine,  tactics, techniques,  and procedures to manage and use data from  numerous  sources,  including digital  networks,  in  operations  at the brigade, division, and  corps level.  The Army  was  also  nearing completion of FM 3 -36, Electronic Warfare  in  Operations , part  of  a broader effort to automate spectrum synchronization and to improve the coordination of jamming activities. Finally, FM 7-0, Training for Full Spectrum Operations , provided soldiers  with  a  training  regimen that allowed them to maintain their core  capabilities  while  preparing for specific missions, such as stability operations  and  irregular warfare. Along with its work on the new  field  manuals,  the Army  was deeply  involved  in  a  government-

FM 3-0, Operations , issued February 2008



wide  review  of  Department  of  Defense  Directive  3000.05, Military Support for Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations , a  seminal  doctrinal  publication  it  first  issued  in  FY  2005.  The  review was slated to yield a new directive focused on irregular warfare dealing with counterterrorism, unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, counterinsurgency, and stability operations. Some in the Army leadership strongly disagreed with the idea of including stability operations under the rubric of irregular warfare, arguing that the two were distinct and required different doctrine, equipment, and personnel. As of the end of the fiscal year, the debate remained unresolved, forcing the Defense Department to postpone publication.

## Army Aviation

In  2008,  the  Army  Aviation  Branch  continued  to  modernize  its program, to convert units to modular design, and to develop doctrine for full-spectrum operations, all while flying over 2.3 million hours in support of combat operations in the Global War on Terrorism. Using funds from the  Comanche program, an armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter that the service terminated in 2004, Army Aviation acquired and developed a number of new systems, including the light utility helicopter, the joint cargo aircraft, and the extended range/multipurpose (ER/MP) Sky Warrior,

an unmanned aircraft system. It also acquired the UH -60M, an updated version  of  the  Black  Hawk  four-blade,  twin-engine,  medium-lift  utility helicopter; and an improved CH -47F Chinook heavy-lift cargo helicopter. The Army also decided to upgrade its Apache fleet of helicopters to what was  known  as  the  block  III  standard,  which  would  improve  its  digital interconnectivity and thereby its ability to control unmanned aerial vehicles. The changes would also improve the vehicle's range sensors,  weapons, and performance, along with reducing its operations and support costs. Aviation also helped establish a program budget for the small unmanned air vehicle. Along with weapons platforms, the branch converted eleven active component and eight reserve combat aviation brigades to modular design, and it fielded an aviation element for every brigade combat team and Stryker unit in the service. In addition, it continued to establish theater aviation commands and to expand Army Special Operations Aviation, and it  began  converting  four Aviation  Classification  Repair Activity  Depots to the Theater Aviation Sustainment Maintenance Group. Army Aviation also worked with other services to develop Joint Future Theater Lift and Joint Multi-Role helicopters. Along with these accomplishments, it made significant changes to its training and doctrine, revising all its base field manuals, and having all its initial-entry rotary-wing students participate in a new training program known as Flight School XXI, in which students spend more time training on the aircraft they will be designated to fly as pilots and less time on older-generation craft.

## Deployed Operational Forces

Operation IraqI Freedom underwent dramatic transitions in FY 2008. As the year began, operations reached levels not seen since the end of major combat in 2003. By September, however, troop levels had dropped considerably along with the levels of violence. One factor in this change was the Bush administration' s decision in January 2007 to launch a fresh approach  to  the  war,  the  'new  way  forward.' The  approach  included  a 'surge' of additional U.S. forces and an array of new tactics to help stem rising  levels  of  internecine  fighting  between  Sunni  and  Shi'ite  groups, along  with  increasing  attacks  against  U.S.  and  international  troops  that were there to help maintain peace, to train indigenous forces and police, and to help stabilize the Iraqi government. The bulk of the surge forces came  from  five  U.S. Army  brigade  combat  teams. Troop  levels  for  all services increased from about 164,700 at the time of the announcement to a peak of around 218,500 in October 2007. Of this total, roughly 138,500 came from all three Army components.

Tactically,  along  with  the  surge  in  troops,  the  'new  way  forward' implemented  counterinsurgency  methods  focused  on  population  security.

The Army's latest version of the Black Hawk helicopter, the UH-60M



The military began making extensive use of concrete barriers, checkpoints, curfews, and biometric technologies for identification, including fingerprinting and retinal scans to divide fractious areas within the country and to track individuals. In addition, whereas the coalition had consolidated its forces in large forward operating bases outside of population centers to ensure their protection up through 2006, beginning in 2007 it began moving to smaller outposts within local communities to maintain closer contact with the populace and work more closely with their Iraqi partners. As of January 2008, for example, Multi-National Division-Center had established fiftythree such bases in their restive area south of Baghdad.

Once all surge forces had deployed to Iraq, operations under the 'new way forward' began in earnest in June 2007 and continued into FY 2008. Working with Iraqi counterparts, Multi-National Division-Baghdad, led by the 4th Infantry Division after December 2007, launched a series of operations called Phantom thunder , Phantom StrIke , and then Phantom PhoenIx to clear Baghdad of extremists, neighborhood by neighborhood, hold  these  areas  with  a  street-level  military  presence,  and  have  Iraqis maintain  day-to-day  security  thereafter.  U.S.  Special  Operations  Forces were also closely involved.

Multi-National  Division-North,  led  by  the  1st  Armored  Division, focused  during  the  year  on  clearing  and  holding  areas  north  and  east of  Baghdad and Al Anbar, particularly the Diyala River Valley and the northern Tigris River Valley in Ninewah Province, where al-Qaeda of Iraq affiliates had sought refuge after being driven out of the capital. In January,

U.S. forces supported the Iraqi 5th Army Division in a successful drive against extremists in Muqdadiyah, by staging blocking operations and by providing  air,  logistics,  and  engineering  support.  Between  January  and May 2008, Iraqi and some coalition troops undertook operations against al-Qaeda in the Mosul area, but the offensive had mixed results, and by the end of the year Multi-National Corps-Iraq was making plans to follow up on the Iraqi' s efforts in the region.

In  the  restive  area  south  of  Baghdad,  Multi-National  DivisionCenter,  led  by  the  3d  Infantry  Division,  drove  Shi'ite  and  Sunni extremists into more focused pockets, including Salman Pak and Arab Jabour. On 25 March 2008, Iraqi security forces undertook their major operation  in  Al  Basrah, Sawlat  al-FurSan (Charge  of  the  Knights). Multi-National Force-Iraq officials, however, believed the undertaking was  ill-conceived.  Ultimately,  U.S.  embedded  transition  teams  had  to step in to assist with advice and support, including air strikes and airlifts. A focus of the fighting was Sadr City, from which militia forces loyal to the Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had been launching rocket attacks into Baghdad. The battle ended in May 2008 when al-Sadr agreed to allow Iraqi forces into the area.

In  addition  to  military  operations,  another  key  mission  for  U.S. personnel  was  training  and  advising  Iraqi  security  forces.  Progress  in this effort, however, was mixed by the end of the year. In 2008, the U.S. military made increasing use of embedded 'transition teams' that lived and  worked  with  Iraqi  units,  and  'unit  partnering,'  in  which  coalition maneuver units worked alongside Iraqi units of equal or larger size. In addition, roughly four hundred civilian international police advisers served in the theater, supported by a U.S. military police brigade, and about 183 military  transition  teams  worked  with  Iraqi  Army  units  from  battalion to division level. The Army also created a joint service military training program under the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, with followon training in Kuwait and Iraq.

Underlying  the  transitions  in  forces  and  tactics  was  a  looming transformation  of  U.S.-Iraqi  diplomatic  relations.  The  legal  basis  for presence  of  the  multinational  force  in  Iraq  was  United  Nations  (UN) Security Council Resolution 1790, which had been passed in December 2007 and was set to expire a year later. The Iraqi government indicated that it wanted to replace the UN mandate with a U.S.-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement  that  would  potentially  cover  such  matters  as  U.S.  military operations  in  Iraq,  Iraqi  control  of  its  airspace,  each  nation' s  rules  and procedures for detainee operations, and how both countries would handle the legal jurisdiction for military and civilian personnel and contractors. Negotiations  had  begun  in  the  spring  and  were  reportedly  nearing completion at the end of the year.

There were also important innovations in joint force operations in Iraq during the year. Until 2007, improvised explosive devices-small roadside bombs made from easily available materials-had been a leading cause of coalition casualties. Multi-National Corps-Iraq, working with experts from the Defense Department's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, responded by creating dedicated cells to share intelligence and train forces in the latest countering techniques. As a result, coalition forces  reduced  the  number  of  attacks  from  about  one  hundred  ten  in September 2007 to about twenty-six incidents a year later.  In  addition, small interservice and interagency teams, working with Special Operations Forces,  collaborated  to  share  intelligence  and  sophisticated  technology to successfully kill or capture key extremist leaders and destabilize their organizations.

From its peak of 218,500 military personnel committed to Operation IraqI  Freedom in  October  2007,  the  United  States  began  withdrawing surge forces and by the end of June 2008, it was down to 183,100. At the close of FY 2008, the total had increased some to 190,400. About 121,500  of  these  troops  were  Army  personnel  from  all  components. Reflecting the preponderance of Army forces in the country, the service suffered 315 out of the 366 total U.S. casualties for the year (both killed

in  action  and  accidents),  and  2,263  of  the  2,516  total  U.S.  wounded. Noting some successes from the 'new way forward' policies, President Bush  announced  on  9  September  2008  that  he  would  redeploy  more troops over several months, including about 3,400 combat support forces by November and a Marine Corps battalion and an Army brigade combat team by February 2009.

U.S.  operations  in Afghanistan  also  intensified  in  FY  2008. At  the close of the year, nearly 32,300 U.S. military forces from all services were involved in operations under Operation endurIng Freedom, an increase of 7,060 since October 2007 and a buildup of nearly one-third since 200 6 . About 21,000 troops in September 2008 came from Army components. The U.S. Army suffered 123 of the 162 total U.S. casualties (both killed in action and accidents), and 678 of the 900 total U.S. wounded.

The United States had sent the additional forces to the country to help quell elevated levels of violence, mostly from the Taliban, fundamentalist Muslim  insurgents  primarily  from  Pashtun  tribes.  Military  officials estimated that two thousand to three thousand full-time insurgents were operating in the country, with another seven thousand to eight thousand irregulars. Since 2006,  the insurgents had  adopted  and  effectively implemented some of the same tactics as Iraqi insurgents, such as suicide attacks  and  roadside  bombs.  In  addition,  many  Afghans,  particularly from the Pashtun regions in the east and south of the country, had grown disillusioned  with  the  lack  of  visible  improvements  in  governance  and living conditions.

The U.S. troops were part of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led force, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), with headquarters in  Kabul.  U.S.  Army  General  Dan  K.  McNeill  commanded  ISAF  up through  2  June  2008,  and  U.S.  Army  General  David  D.  McKiernan commanded  it  through  the  remainder  of  the  fiscal  year.  ISAF' s  U.S. combat  element  was  Combined  Joint Task  Force-82  (CJTF-82),  with headquarters  at  Bagram  Air  Base  north  of  Kabul.  Up  through  April 2008, it was commanded by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, who also served as the commander for Regional Command-East, one of ISAF's  four  multinational  regional  subordinate  commands.  CJTF-82's area of operation covered a 46.3-square-mile region in the northeastern portion of Afghanistan. It was the most heavily populated of the regional commands, with seven million to ten million inhabitants, mostly ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, and Hazaras. Rugged mountain ranges dominated the terrain,  and most of the population resided in two arable river valleys that  traversed  it.  CJTF-82  contained  the  division  headquarters  of  the 82d Airborne Division, augmented to perform a joint task force role. It also commanded some non-ISAF forces. Of the two maneuver brigades, the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 82d Airborne Division had a large

area of operations in the southern portion of the region, and the 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team operated in the north.

In  addition  to  its  combat  elements,  ISAF  included  a  multinational subordinate command, Combined Security Transition CommandAfghanistan, which oversaw the training and mentoring of Afghan military, border patrol, and police. Since July 2007, the command had been led by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Robert W. Cone and had its headquarters in Camp Eggers, Kabul. Its training component, Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) Phoenix, was manned and led by U.S. Army National Guard units. From June 2007 to April 2008, it was known as CJTF Phoenix V , and it was comprised  of  elements  of  the  218th  Infantry  Brigade  (South  Carolina Army National  Guard).  From April  through  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year, it was led by the 27th Brigade Combat Team (New Y ork Army National Guard)  and  known  as  CJTF  Phoenix VI.  ISAF  also  included  a  special operations formation known as Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Afghanistan,  which  included  elements  of  the  3d  Special  Forces Group and the 7th Special Forces Group.

During  the  year,  U.S.  combat  forces  throughout  Afghanistan  were stretched  thin,  so  tactical  commanders  chose  to  position  small  units,  at most a platoon, in a large number of forward operating bases and combat outposts  to  disrupt  the  insurgents  and  to  facilitate  development  efforts. Because  of  this,  commanders  had  to  continuously  shift  their  combat power and the placement of these outposts to respond to changing tactical situations and the routine transition of units into and out of the country. Many  of  the  smaller  units  were  engaged  in  daily  firefights.  Battalionsized  maneuver  forces  conducted  the  bulk  of  the  security  or  combat operations.  They  worked  concurrently  with  provincial  reconstruction teams, which included military civil affairs specialists and civilian experts in reconstruction and governmental affairs. The reconstruction teams did most of the development work and, along with the tactical units, performed information  operations  and  improved  the  reach  of  the  democratically elected government of Afghanistan.

Throughout the  year, Army  units  cycled  in  and  out  of  the  country. A  major  transition  occurred  on  10  April  2008,  when  Headquarters, 82d Airborne  Division,  was  replaced  by  Headquarters,  101st Airborne Division,  and  the  command  was  renamed  Combined  Joint Task  Force101. Along with the headquarters element, the division deployed several subordinate  commands,  including  the  101st  Sustainment  Brigade  and the  101st Aviation  Brigade. Within  Regional  Command-East,  the  173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team remained, and it was joined by the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division.

In  one  of  the  more  significant  battles  of  the  year,  nine  American soldiers  died  while  fighting  a  pitched  battle  in  the  village  of  Wanat  in

Afghanistan's Waygal Valley on 13 July 2008. An estimated two hundred militants launched a surprise attack on nearby Combat Outpost Kahler, which was manned by Company C, 2d Battalion, 503d Parachute Infantry Regiment,  and  twenty-four Afghan  National Army  soldiers. After  four hours of intense close-quarters combat, the coalition forces repelled the attackers.

In February 2007, the Army fielded its first Human Terrain team to theater. The team was an experimental concept, in which specially trained social scientists, working with military personnel, were deployed alongside Army brigades in forward operating bases and on missions. The teams were to  compile  social,  ethnic,  cultural,  economic,  and  political  information about villagers, using sophisticated mapping and information technology, and to provide their military colleagues with insights about local customs, language, and leaders. The Army hoped that the teams would enable its personnel  to  communicate  and  cooperate  more  effectively  with  local populations and to reduce the chances for violence. The teams typically consisted of an adviser to the commander, two social scientists, a research manager with an intelligence background, and a human terrain analyst, all with at least secret clearances. The information gathered by the teams was analyzed at two facilities, known as Reachback Research Centers, staffed with regional experts, one focused on Afghanistan at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and one focused on Iraq at Newport News, Virginia. In early 2008, the Department of Defense expanded the program by reallocating $49.5 million to it from the Iraq Freedom Fund. By the end of the fiscal year, seven teams were serving in Iraq and two in Afghanistan, and the Army was beginning plans to triple the size of the effort.

The  program  was  controversial.  Some  professional  anthropologists criticized it for violating their professional codes of ethics and accused the Army of using the information to target individual insurgents for capture or assassination. Adding to the controversy were the deaths of two social scientists by roadside bombs while on patrols during the year. Department of Defense personnel and some of the social scientists involved with the program countered that the members maintained their ethical codes, and that it had been successful in reducing violence.

## Army National Guard

## Organizational Change

By FY 2008, the Army National Guard had converted many of its units to modular designs. It was the most comprehensive force structure change in its history. To oversee this process, the Guard' s leadership established a separate modular coordination cell to manage national efforts with state-level cells and maintain information on deploying units. The new brigade combat teams were structured and manned like their active Army counterparts so that  they  could  be  more  easily  combined  with  other  units  or  joint  force elements. With the changes, the Guard was organized into eight divisions, twenty-eight brigade combat teams (seven heavy, twenty infantry, and one Stryker), seven fires brigades, sixteen maneuver enhancement brigades, nine sustainment  brigades,  six  battlefield  surveillance  brigades,  eight  combat aviation brigades, four theater aviation brigades, one theater aviation group, thirty-eight functional brigades, and two special forces groups.

Along  with  its  force  structure,  the  Guard' s  leadership  underwent significant structural transitions during the year. The Empowerment Act, a major element of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, expanded the  authority  of  the  Guard  by  elevating  the  position  of  the  chief  of  the National Guard Bureau from a three- to a four-star general, making it a joint activity of the Department of Defense and enhancing its advisory role to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. No one was nominated to fill the four-star position by the end of the fiscal year.

The delays in passing the Defense Department' s base and supplemental budgets  forced  the  National  Guard  to  restructure  its  program  funding during the fiscal year. Because the Guard' s leaders expected to get almost 30 percent of its total obligation authority from the supplemental budget, they allocated most of their available funds at the start of the year to critical, time-sensitive programs  such  as  premobilization  training,  persistent conflict requirements, recruiting and retention, tuition assistance, schools, and  funeral  honors  with  the  expectation  that  they  would  receive  the resources they required in the supplemental budget to fund the Guard' s other programs. Ultimately, the strategy was successful because the Guard received a 2.5-percent increase in appropriation and was able to fund 99 percent of its total obligation authority.

## Personnel Management

The National Guard added over 30,000 soldiers since  mid-2005  and achieved an end strength of 360,351. In addition, the component increased its training pipeline to 43,484, reduced the number of soldiers who do not report for required training to 5,095, and greatly increased the number of combat veterans. Contributing to these successes was the Army National Guard's Recruiting Assistance Program, which had enlisted 62,790 since it  was implemented in 2005. Under the program, the Guard used civilian contract recruiters working in their own communities under performancebased subcontracts. Another factor in the recruiting success were the Guard' s bonus programs, which offered up to $20,000 for enlistments, and up to $15,000 for reenlistments, retention, and prior service.

The National Guard's full-time support staff assisted in preparing units for  missions  at  home  and  abroad,  but  remained  significantly  underresourced. In  2008,  the  component  was  authorized  only  69  percent  of  its  regular requirement  of  42,329  military  technicians  and  only  66  percent  of  its requirement of 42,471 for active Guard and Reserve soldiers. Guard and Reserve members who volunteered to serve in full-time, active-duty status provided administrative, recruiting, and instructional support to National Guard, Reserve, and active-duty units. Complicating matters further, these requirements were based on the Guard's Cold War function as a strategic reserve, even though it was serving as an operational force due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response, National Guard leaders undertook manpower studies through the end of FY 2008 to develop new support requirement  levels,  and  they  advocated  to  national  leaders  to  increase support levels at least to the Cold War numbers.

Soldier  support  was  also  an  important  Guard  concern  in  2008. The  component  provided  more  than  three  hundred  personnel  to  help staff  Community-Based  Warrior  Transition  Units  (formerly  known  as Community-Based Health Care Organizations). These facilities provided high-quality health care, administrative processing, and transition assistance for recuperating wounded  soldiers (principally from  the Guard and Reserve), while allowing them to live at home and to perform duties close to their families. At the end of the fiscal year, more than one thousand soldiers throughout the United States were being managed under the  program.  For  soldiers'  families,  the  National  Guard  supplemented Army and Department of Defense programs with a number of their own. Included  among  these  was  the  Family  Team  Building  Program,  which provided specialized training on deployment matters via computer modules and  in-person  classes;  325  Family  Assistance  Centers,  which  offered information, referrals, and outreach; and the Y ellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, which provided soldiers, their families, and their employers with

information,  services,  and  referrals  on  mobilization,  deployment,  and reintegration. Since the Y ellow Ribbon program' s inception in 2007, the National Guard had conducted 135 Y ellow Ribbon events, it had provided states with $8,645,700 in funding, and it had established a $10,485,171 national contract to place full-time personnel within state headquarters. In July 2008, it held a nationwide workshop for these personnel.

## Training and Readiness

In  2008,  the  National  Guard  was  able  to  fund  only  83  percent  of the  cost  of  operations  and  equipment  maintenance,  administration,  and housekeeping supplies that it required for collective maneuver training. In addition, units left a significant amount of equipment in theater, creating shortages at the National Guard' s home stations and forcing the units to rely on existing items, which were rapidly aging. This continued a downward trend  begun  in  2005.  Despite  these  difficulties,  the  Guard  continued  a rigorous training effort. Using $22 million in specially appropriated funds, it prepared units through its Combat Training Centers for National Guard Personnel,  Army.  It  also  coordinated  support  for  sixteen  active  Army brigades  at  the  National Training  Center,  Fort  Irwin,  California,  and  at the  Joint  Readiness Training  Center,  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana.  In  addition, the  Recruit  Sustainment  Program,  implemented in 2005 and funded by states with supplemental congressional appropriations, provided realistic training for more than 3,800 soldiers from over twenty-five states.

## Mobilization

Since  September  2001,  the  National  Guard  has  deployed  345,764 soldiers in support of the Global War on Terrorism. During FY 2008, a total of 9,001 guardsmen were deployed in support of Operation endurIng Freedom and 43,205 in support of Operation IraqI Freedom . In addition, some  2,300  Guard  forces  were  deployed  during  the  year  to  the  U.S.Mexican border to assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection with border security  under  Operation JumP  Start ,  which  ended  in  July  2008.  More than 17,000 Guard personnel across the nation had participated in JumP Start since its inception in 2006. At the end of the 2008, a total of 80,419 guardsmen were on alert for future deployments.

Domestically, the Guard continued to provide forces for disaster relief and security. In May, guardsmen from Wyoming deployed to help prepare for  possible  flooding  along  the  Little  Snake  River.  In  June,  guardsmen from Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin responded to historic flooding in their respective states, and 1,100 guardsmen from California fought  fires  in  that  state.  In August  and  September,  40,000  guardsmen

served as relief forces to support civilian authorities; personnel from more than twenty states supported operations and local law enforcement officials along the Gulf Coast. Also in August, Texas Army National Guard soldiers served in active-duty status in response to Tropical Storm Edouard, and 18,000 soldiers from many states responded to Hurricane Gustav.

In  addition  to  contingencies  and  disaster  relief,  the  Guard  provided 6,300 personnel and $23 million to support the U.S. European Command; 2,561 personnel and $12.2 million for the U.S. Southern Command; 2,100 personnel  and  $2.5  million  for  the  U.S.  Central  Command;  and  3,596 personnel and $13.2 million for the U.S. Pacific Command. Finally, the 19th and 20th Special Forces Groups and seven Special Operations Detachments supported  combatant  commands  worldwide  through  the  U.S.  Special Operations Command.

## Equipment and Maintenance

At the end of FY 2008, the Guard had available only 76 percent of its Modified Table of Organization and Equipment (MTOE) requirements. Since some of this equipment was being used to support mobilized and deployed units, only 63 percent of the Guard' s MTOE requirements was available to the nation' s governors. During the year, the Guard operated more than 56,000 facilities, including 3,087 readiness centers (armories) to sustain, restore, and modernize equipment. Additionally, depot maintenance received  $343.6  million,  a  49  percent  increase  over  2007, and overhauled 3,275 tactical vehicles. The allocation included a one-time addition for the Grow the Army initiative, funds to rebuild the component' s aged  tactical  wheeled  vehicle  fleet,  and  money  to  address  near-term equipment readiness issues with M88A1 recovery vehicles, M109A6 selfpropelled  howitzers,  and  multiple-launch  rocket  systems.  In  contrast  to previous years, Congress allocated $166.7 million directly to the Guard allowing it to conduct reset operations at home stations.



## Management and Planning

In FY 2007, Congress had appropriated $17.1 billion in supplemental funds to assist the Army in resetting equipment that had returned from theater,  and  it  provided  another  $16.1  billion  in  FY  2008. This  effort included  replacing  old,  obsolete,  and  worn-out  items;  recapitalizing other  items  to  extend  their  life  spans;  and  repairing  those  items  that could be overhauled to Army standards. To oversee the program and to ensure that the funds were being used effectively, the Army established the  Reset  Task  Force  at  the  Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army. Since the program's inception, the Army had reset twenty-three brigades and begun work on another fourteen by the close of 2008. As a result, it  had  ordered  more  than  52,000  items  on  contract  and  repaired  more than 123,000 at the Army's organic maintenance depots and commercial contractor  facilities,  bringing  these  services  to  their  highest  level  of activity in thirty-five years.

As part of the 2005 BRAC recommendations, the U.S. Army Materiel Command  (AMC)  was  expected  to  relocate  around  11,000  employee positions  by  2011.  One  of  the  most  significant  moves  involved  the command's headquarters, which in 2008 began a five-phase plan to relocate from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to the Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama. The move would involve the transfer of 1,100 positions. By the end of the year, about 100 employees had already made the move to Redstone, and the command had awarded a $114 million contract to design a new headquarters building there. Another major move within AMC involved the  Communications-Electronics  Life  Cycle  Management  Command, which began relocating its 7,000 employees from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Construction in Maryland began in March 2008 on a new $477 million complex. In addition to these changes, the command began to close four ammunition plants, three of which  were  producing  ammunition;  it  shuttered  three  chemical  depots that were actively demilitarizing weapons; it was consolidating the TankAutomotive and Armaments Command's Integrated Materiel Management Center  and  moving  it  to  the  Detroit  Arsenal;  and  it  was  transferring responsibility for procuring items that could be overhauled and repaired,

along  with  managing  consumables,  to  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency, thereby making the process more centralized and efficient.

The AMC also underwent a historic leadership change in FY 2008. On 28 June, Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody, who had been serving as Deputy Chief of Staff, G -4, U.S. Army Headquarters, was appointed as the AMC's deputy commanding general. She was the first woman to hold the position. One month later, she was promoted to four-star general, the first woman in the service to hold that rank, and she received an assignment to begin serving as the AMC's first woman commanding general beginning in the fall 2009.

Indicative of the AMC's achievements in management and efficiency, in 2008 six of its activities received the Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing, a Utah State University award that Business  Week magazine coined the 'Nobel prize of manufacturing.'

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The role of the Army' s research, development, and acquisition (RDA) programs is to identify and develop new and emerging technologies and materiel, and to acquire new equipment to replace worn and antiquated items. In FY 2008, the Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) portion of these programs increased from $11.4 billion in FY 2007 to $12.6 billion in FY 2008. It accounted for roughly 8 percent of the Army's total base budget in the president' s FY 2008 budget proposal. This allocation covered a wide variety of activities, including independent laboratory research, avionics, ballistics, engineering, information technology,  medical  technology,  and  test  ranges  and  facilities.  In  terms of outlay, the twelve most expensive programs were the Future Combat Systems,  Stryker  Interim  Armored  Vehicles,  Apache  Longbow  Attack Helicopter (AH 64) Modifications, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles, -Black  Hawk  Utility  Helicopters  (UH 60),  Chinook  Cargo  Helicopter -Modernization  (CH 47),  Abrams  Tank  Upgrade  (M1AA1  and  M1S2 -System  Enhancement  Package),  High-Mobility  Multipurpose  Wheeled Vehicles, Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters, Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles, Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense, and Joint Network Node-Network.

Procurement included five separate funds -aviation, missiles, weapons and track combat vehicles, ammunition, and other items. It covered such activities as purchasing fully developed systems, modifying existing ones to  enhance their  capabilities  and  extend  their  life  span,  acquiring  spare parts, and improving facilities involved in manufacturing and modifying equipment. As with the RDT&amp;E, procurement funds increased from $43.1 billion in 2007 to $65.5 billion in 2008. Altogether, procurement accounted

for roughly 18 percent of the Army' s total base budget in the president' s FY 2008 budget proposal.

Begun in FY 2003, the Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI) was an  Army effort to furnish all deploying soldiers with equipment tailored for their specific missions using existing programs, lessons learned from ongoing operations, and  commercially  available  technology.  TRADOC  was  responsible  for regularly  updating  the  equipment  lists.  RFI  quickly  became  the  largest equipment fielding  effort  since World War  II. Although  it  was  originally scheduled to end in FY 2007, the Army decided to extend it indefinitely. In 2008, the Army continued to refine and streamline the program to make it more efficient. One initiative it implemented was known as lean fielding, under which soldiers who were on repeat tours could decline to accept items that they already had. The initiative saved $28.5 million.

As a complement to Rapid Fielding, in FY 2003 the Army created the Rapid Equipping Force as a staff support agency under the Army G -3/5/7, Headquarters,  Department  of  the Army,  and  is  located  at  Fort  Belvoir, Virginia. Its mission was to identify commercially available technologies that could be sped to deployed troops outside of the traditional acquisitions process.  The agency  canvassed  members  of  the  military, industry, academia, and the science community for their insights into existing and emerging technologies. It also deployed teams to work with soldiers to identify their needs, and it coordinated with the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization and the Army Asymmetric Warfare Group. By  2008,  the  agency  had  introduced  550  types  of  equipment,  fielded more  than  75,000  items  to  deployed  units,  and  transferred  70  projects to  acquisition  program  managers  or  to  the  Army  Materiel  Command. Among its key developments had been the Sniper Defeat System, which developed  capabilities  to  prevent,  react  to,  and  survive  sniper  attacks; the  Ballistic  Protection  Experiment  that  developed  armor  designed  to defeat Explosively Formed Penetrator Improvised Explosive Devices; the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery to provide energy independence to isolated  battlefield  locations;  and  the  Enhanced  Logistics  Support  OffRoad Vehicle to provide support to soldiers over rough terrain.

In 2003, the Army began a program to develop a complex collection of highly sophisticated, manned and unmanned weapons systems linked by  an  overarching  computer  network  to  equip  its  brigades -the  Future Combat Systems or FCS. At the time, the service selected two contractors, Boeing Company and Science Applications International Corporation, to be the lead systems integrators, giving them unprecedented authority to oversee the project and all the subcontracts. The Army initially expected the  project  to  cost  about  $91.4  billion,  making  it  the  largest  and  most expensive  modernization  effort  since World War  II. The  weapons  were expected to be lighter than the Army' s principal systems at that time -the

M1 Abrams tank, Bradley fighting vehicle, and Stryker vehicle -and to be better able to project power. The system was also supposed to be airtransportable by Air Force C -130 aircraft.

By FY 2006, costs for the program had escalated beyond the Army's original estimates, bringing it under increased media and congressional scrutiny.  Concerned  about  the  cost,  competing  materiel  demands  from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, progress delays, and skepticism by some experts about its feasibility, Congress cut more than $789 million from the project between FYs 2006 and 2008 and instituted a rigorous set of reporting  requirements  for  the  Army.  In  response,  by  March  2007  the Army  scaled  back  the  project  from  its  originally  envisioned  eighteen weapons platforms to fourteen, and it slowed the procurement schedule to one brigade a year between 2015 and 2030 until it had a full fleet of fifteen. The service also adjusted its projections for what it referred to as 'spin out one' technologies-equipment to be used to update existing brigade combat teams in 2014 as an interim step to the full FCS modernization. It reduced the number of technologies from four to three, but it increased the total number of brigades that would get them from three to six. Army leaders projected that these changes would save $3.4 billion through 2015, leaving the total estimated cost at around $230 billion.

Once fully developed, the restructured FCS would include eight types of air-transportable combat vehicles based on a common platform. They were the Mounted Combat System, capable of direct and beyond-line-ofsight fires; the Infantry Carrier Vehicle, capable of transporting a nine-man infantry squad; the fully automated Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon; the NonLine-of-Sight Mortar, with a 120-mm. mortar and a dismountable 81-mm. mortar  for  indirect  fires;  the  Reconnaissance  and  Surveillance Vehicle, with advanced sensors to identify distant targets under all conditions and unmanned vehicles; the Command and Control Vehicle that would serve as the center for battlefield coordination; two types of medical transport vehicles; and a recovery and maintenance vehicle.

The FCS ground vehicles would deploy a number of sophisticated subsystems, including unmanned  aerial and ground vehicles for surveillance and fires; two models of unattended ground sensors to serve as expendable,  low-cost  devices  for  perimeter  defense,  surveillance, target  acquisition,  and  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear weapons detection; and a new family of missiles in a container launch unit-the Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System. Critical to operating the entire complex of weapons, soldiers, and sensors was the overarching, interactive  computer  network.  It  would  be  based  on  commercially available hardware that could translate Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allied messages into a unified format, and it would be able to handle all aspects of mission planning and preparation.

The first MRAPs arrive at Camp Liberty, Iraq, in November 2008.



In  FY  2008,  FCS  remained  the  Army's  biggest  RDA  program, involving more than 550 contractors and subcontractors in 41 states and 220 congressional districts, but it still experienced a number of contractions. In April 2008, the Army revised its total cost down by 1.6 percent. In June, it  restructured  the  program  again.  Whereas  the  service  originally  had intended to begin fielding full systems in FY 2014, principally to heavy brigades, it refocused on developing 'spin out one' technologies that it would field to ten infantry brigade combat teams scheduled to deploy to Iraq  and  Afghanistan  between  2011  and  2013.  The  program,  however, did achieve a number of milestones during the fiscal year. By August, the Army Test and Evaluation Command and TRADOC began preliminary tests of the equipment for the infantry brigades. In September, the FCS successfully  fired  the  first  artillery  projectile  from  the  Manned  Ground Vehicle, Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon prototype. As FY 2008 drew to a close, the Army was considering a plan to accelerate the fielding of prototypes by transferring more than $2 billion from funds used to maintain its older systems,  most  notably  the  M1  Abrams  tank,  Bradley  fighting  vehicle, and Stryker vehicle, to the FCS, but even as these changes were under discussion,  Congress  was  debating  additional  cuts  to  the  program  and increasing its oversight.

Mine-resistant,  ambush-protected  vehicles,  more  commonly  known by  the  acronym  MRAP ,  were  heavily  armored,  wheel-based  personnel carriers with a blast-resistant underbody designed to protect the crew from

mines, fragmentary devices, and some direct-fire weapons. In May 2007, following  public  and  congressional  pressure,  the  secretary  of  defense made purchasing  MRAPs  the  Department's  highest  priority  acquisition program,  and  in  September  2007  the  Department  issued  a  requirement for  15,374  vehicles,  of  which  11,953  would  go  to  the Army.  By  year' s end, the Army fielded 7,000 of the vehicles. In mid-July 2008, the Army issued a request to the vehicle production contractors to propose a lighter, more maneuverable design with the same or better survivability to meet emerging theater requirements.

In 2008, the Army had three varieties of MRAPs. Category I could carry  six  people  or  more,  and  it  supported  operations  in  an  urban environment  and  other  restricted/confined  spaces,  including  mounted patrols,  reconnaissance,  communications,  and  command  and  control. Category II could carry ten people or more, and supported multimission operations,  such  as  convoy  lead,  troop  transport,  explosive  ordnance disposal,  ambulance,  and  combat  engineering.  Category  III  supported mine and improvised explosive device clearance operations and explosive ordnance disposal.

## Support Services

Soldier, Health, and Family

When  General  Casey  became  chief  of  staff  in  April  2007,  he made improving the Army's support to its soldiers and their families one of the keystones of his effort to rebalance the force. In FY 2008, to  demonstrate  the  service's  commitment  to  this  goal,  senior  Army leaders visited Army installations throughout the world and signed a document called the Army Family Covenant, which pledged the service to  devote $1.4 billion to improve soldier and family life. One of the programs supported by these funds was the Army Family Action Plan, in  which  delegates  from  various  installations  met  to  discuss  issues important  to  soldiers  and  families,  and  to  provide  recommendations on these matters to Army leaders. Through the program, the Army had enacted 107 legislative changes, 154 new or revised policies, and 170 programmatic improvements.

Another initiative was the Soldier and Family Action Plan, headed by  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for  Installation  Management.  Under the  plan,  the Army  had  created  an  online  resource, Army  OneSource; established Soldier and Family Assistance Centers for wounded soldiers and their families; expanded survivor outreach services; improved onpost housing through the Residential Communities Initiative, a military housing privatization program; funded seventy-two child development center  construction  projects  and  eleven  new  youth  centers;  expanded community-based  outreach  services  in  forty-two  states  to  children and  youth  through  the  Operation  Military  Kids  program;  increased educational opportunities in eleven states through the Interstate Compact on  Educational  Opportunity  for  Military  Children;  and  worked  with thirty-five states to pass legislation allowing military family members to receive in-state college tuition rates.

Other Army programs aided families. The Army hired one thousand new Family Readiness Support Assistants, who worked at the unit level to  provide  support  services  to  deployed  soldiers  and  their  families, and  it  provided  the  program  with  $45  million.  In  addition,  the  service budgeted  $1.162  billion  for  the Army  Family  Housing  program,  which built, maintained, and operated a worldwide inventory of 30,907 owned

and 12,486 leased units at installations where suitable quarters were not available for soldiers and their families.

Beginning in February 2007, the Army was stung by a string of press revelations  about  wounded  soldiers  receiving  inadequate  care,  and  in March the Army Inspector General issued a report that confirmed some of the allegations. The Inspector General found that outpatient cases had nearly doubled from 2002 to 2006 due to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that the Army's medical care system had been unable to cope with these additional burdens. In June 2007, in response to the findings, the service issued the Army Medical Action Plan (AMAP). The plan was to centralize and standardize medical care across the service.

At the hub of the Army's new plan was the Warrior Transition Unit (WTU).  This  unit  was  fully  staffed  with  trained  medical  and  Army personnel to provide injured soldiers with what the Army called a 'Triad of Care'-a primary care manager, usually a physician; a registered nurse who coordinates and monitors options and services; and a squad leader, usually a noncommissioned officer, who provides direct oversight of the service members and ensures that they attend medical and administrative appointments.  By  the  beginning  of  FY  2008,  the  service  established thirty-two such units in the continental United States, one each in Alaska and Hawaii, and three in Germany. During FY 2008, the Department of the Army Inspector General conducted inspections of the new WTUs to identify problems and to improve their functioning.

In addition, the Army instituted a new policy in January, under which WTU  personnel  were  required  to  develop  individual  plans,  known  as Comprehensive Care Plans, for each wounded soldier within thirty days of when the soldier first entered the unit. These plans would cover all aspects of the soldier' s recovery-medical, mental, housing, and vocational.

Despite the Army's efforts during the fiscal year to staff the WTUs with trained personnel, the service was unable to keep up with increased numbers of wounded Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.  In  June  2008,  the service found that twenty-one WTUs had insufficient personnel to meet patient-to-staff  ratios  that  the  service  had  established  under AMAP . To address the shortfall, in July the Army directed commanders at the various installations  to  staff  the  units  using  personnel  from  their  other  medical facilities.  Within  a  month,  all  but  four  had  met  staffing  requirements. Between March 2007 and the end of FY 2008, the service had dedicated more than 3,200 personnel to AMAP , provided $900 million in funding, and treated nearly 8,500 soldiers.

The Army continued to face a daunting problem with suicides in FY 2008. By the end of August 2008, ninety-three active-duty soldiers had taken their own lives, and the Army expected the rate per soldier to reach levels not seen since the Vietnam War. Army leaders blamed the problem

primarily on stresses brought about by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. To address the problem, the Army added more resources to existing programs and launched a number of new initiatives. One new program was called Ask,  Care,  Escort,  a  comprehensive  program  of  refresher  courses  for Army trainers in suicide prevention techniques. On 11 February 2008, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel met with the Army Surgeon General, the Chief of Chaplains, and the Director of Human Resources Policy, G-1, to  assess the Army' s existing programs and ways to improve them. The group determined that the service would have to take a multidisciplinary approach to suicide prevention. It would also have to reduce the stigma for personnel who seek mental health care, to improve access to behavioral health providers, to instruct junior leaders on intervention skills, and to keep field commanders informed about the latest prevention techniques and mental health trends within their commands. The Army also created the General Officer Steering Committee for suicide prevention to assess policies. In September, the service held National Suicide Prevention Week, during which it tried to raise awareness of the problem, and it rolled out a number of new tools, such as an interactive DVD that enabled soldiers to practice techniques they could use to help suicidal colleagues. By the end of the fiscal year, the service had hired 191 new mental health providers at direct-care facilities such as Army medical centers, and it had brought on about 2,800 more through TRICARE.

Along  with  suicide  prevention,  the  Army  and  the  Department  of Defense  also  looked  for  innovative  ways  to  identify  and  treat  soldiers suffering  from  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  A  RAND  study released in 2008 estimated that around three hundred thousand military personnel who had deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan were suffering from PTSD  or  major  depression.  To  help  address  this  problem,  the  service conducted outreach efforts to soldiers, stressing that there was no shame in seeking help for PTSD and other mental health issues.

Because of an increase in the number of brain injuries among soldiers due to the nature of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, in 2007 the Army Surgeon General had created the Proponency Office for Rehabilitation and Reintegration and assigned it the responsibility to develop and implement measures  to  improve  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  traumatic  brain  injury (TBI). In FY 2008, the service dedicated $122 million in supplemental funds to increase access to care, to improve the quality of treatment, and to  develop better screening techniques. The Army could now staff each of its medical treatment facilities with a traumatic brain injury program manager who emphasized primary care and family-centered rehabilitation. In conjunction with the Army' s efforts, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health  Affairs  issued  a  standard  definition  for  the  disorder  and  a gauge for its severity, and created a uniform process for reporting cases.

The Department of Defense began including screening questions for the disorder in the post-deployment health assessments given to personnel. In addition, it worked with the Veterans Administration to develop clinical guidelines  for  mild  cases  of  traumatic  brain  injury  for  deployed  and nondeployed personnel. Finally, the Office of the Surgeon General of the United States released guidelines to establish and standardize screening, treatment, and rehabilitation.

Both  PTSD  and  TBI  research  received  a  special  one-year  boost in  funding  in  FY  2007  that  provided  the  basis  for  investigations  into innovative diagnosis and treatment techniques through FY 2008. Under Public Laws 110-28 and 109-289, Congress provided $151 million for PTSD research and $150 million for TBI research to the  Office  of  the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). Together the appropriations represented the largest one-year expenditure for  military  medical  research  since  1993.  Founded  in  1992,  CDMRP was run by the Army as a research area directorate within the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Its mission was to bring together military, government, and private experts to identify and fund innovative research on medical issues through a rigorous peer-review process. Because CDMRP was not considered a core mission of  the  Department of Defense, the Department did not request funding for it through its annual budget submission; instead, Congress provided it with money to address certain medical matters and attached the funds to the Department's annual appropriation bill. The special appropriations were used to fund the Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury Research  Program,  which  oversaw  171  research  efforts  in  FY  2008. For PTSD, in addition to new forms of talk therapy and medication, the program funded research into myriad unconventional treatment techniques, including acupuncture, yoga, meditation, animal therapy, and biofeedback using video games. For TBI, it looked into new medications and special eyeglass-like devices that can detect brain injuries.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  (MWR)  programs  are  designed to  improve  soldiers'  readiness  by  promoting  their  mental  and  physical fitness  and  well-being. The  programs  support  military  communities  by providing sports and fitness activities, recreation centers, library services, educational opportunities, entertainment programs, leisure travel services, special activities for single soldiers, restaurants, catering, lodging, housing information, and post exchange services. Among the programs that were improved and expanded in FY 2008 were Warrior Adventure Quest, which provided redeploying soldiers with high-adrenaline activities to help relieve

post-deployment  stress;  General  Libraries  Information  System,  which provided Web-based access to library services; an effort to upgrade fitness equipment; and the Armed Forces Recreation Machine Program, which offered  phones,  Internet  access,  cable  television,  and  laptop  computers to soldiers at Army lodges or in Army-supported billets. In addition, the Army deployed twelve personnel to Iraq to develop sports, fitness, and recreation  programs,  and  it  provided  free  or  discounted  admissions  to MWR activities for the family members of deployed soldiers. Finally, it opened a new Armed Forces Recreation Center at Fort Story, Virginia.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

In  FY  2008,  the  mission  of  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange Service  (AAFES)  continued  to  provide  active-duty  soldiers,  airmen, National Guard members, reservists, retirees, and the families of service members throughout the world with services and brand-name goods at competitive prices. AAFES increased its total sales to nearly $10 billion, an increase of about 3 percent from FY 2007. Its total earnings were $376 million, and it provided $264.5 million in dividends to MWR programs. Altogether, AAFES operated more than 3,100 facilities, including 1,765 name-brand restaurants like Burger King, Starbucks, Subway, and Taco Bell, and it ran more than 5,100 concessions. In addition, 400 of its more than 43,000 employees voluntarily deployed to support service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. During the year, AAFES expanded its Web site to  include  over  18  million  items,  and  it  continued  a  $1.2  billion,  fiveyear effort begun in FY 2005 to build and renovate retail outlets. AAFES also completed a transition to a high-technology program called Oracle Retail. This program enabled AAFES to improve allocation of its products and to set prices. To better serve the needs of service members and their families, it introduced thirty-six new sale items under its Exchange Select program that were 20-50 percent less expensive than comparable national brands. These items included health and beauty aids, household cleaning products, office supplies, and photographic equipment. It also increased the number of energy-efficient appliances to 35 percent of its total stock, and  implemented  a  new  program,  Operation Be  FIt ,  which  promoted health and fitness products and services.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

The Army Civil Works Program is one of the four primary missions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It includes such activities as development and management of water resources infrastructure; protection, restoration, and management  of  environmental resources; disaster response and recovery; and engineering services and program and project management. The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) provides oversight and policy direction. The program is funded by the annual Energy and Water Development  Appropriation  Act,  by  contributions  from  state  and  local project sponsors, and through reimbursement from agencies supported by the Corps of Engineers.

In FY 2008, the Army Civil Works Program oversaw the operation of over 600 dams, 900 ports, 12,000 miles of commercial inland navigation channels in 41 states, 240 navigation lock chambers, and 383 major lakes and reservoirs. In addition, it managed 75 hydropower projects and produced about 70.9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. This amounted to 24 percent of  all  U.S.  hydropower  and  3  percent  of  all  U.S.  electrical  capacity.  It also issued some 53,472 Clean Water Act permits. The program was also responsible for managing on average 11.7 million acres of real estate and served as the nation' s principal provider of outdoor recreation, with more than 350 million visitors. In financial terms, the program prevented about $19.6 billion in property damage from floods and provided support to more than 70 federal agencies, including $946 million to the Federal Emergency Management  Agency;  $316  million  to  the  Department  of  Homeland Security, Directorate of Border and Transportation Security; $266 million to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and $108.9 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development. Along with these funds, the Corps of Engineers supplied more than $2.1 billion in engineering and technical support to more than 70 federal, state, local, and international agencies.

## Environmental Programs

The  U.S. Army  Environmental  Command  (USAEC),  a  subordinate command of the Installation Management Command, oversaw the service's

environmental protection programs and provided advice to Army leaders on these matters. The organization was comprised principally of biologists, chemists, engineers, lawyers, and researchers. It worked on the civilian side with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations and  Environment).  In  July  2008,  Col.  Maria  R.  Gervais  replaced  Col. Michael P . O'Keefe as USAEC commander. Gervais, a highly decorated chemical officer and brigade-level commander with extensive operational experience, was the first woman to lead the organization.

Throughout the year, the Army operated a wide range of programs focused  on  enhancing  and  protecting  natural  resources;  restoring  areas contaminated from previous military activities; complying with federal, state, local, and host-nation regulations; and preventing pollution. It  budgeted  $437.7  million  for  these  efforts.  By  2008,  it  had  created sustainability  plans  for  over  twenty  installations  to  improve  energy efficiency, increase the use of recycled products, and reduce pollutants. It had also worked with state, private, and local authorities to preserve over eighty thousand acres of buffer zones around its training facilities. The service also continued an effort begun in 2001 to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2015, using such innovations as spraying foam insulation on tents at overseas bases and more carefully monitoring its equipment and facilities. To this end, in January it began operating a two-megawatt solar  array  at  Fort  Carson,  Colorado,  that  it  expected  would  produce enough power for 540 homes. The Army also began releasing information on its use of resources and its emissions of pollutants under the Global Reporting Initiative' s internationally recognized standards; and it formed the Army Energy Security Task Force to oversee its efforts to comply with Executive  Order  13423, Strengthening  Federal  Environmental,  Energy, and Transportation Management (2007), which established rigorous goals for reducing energy consumption. As a testament to its commitment to the environment, the Army acquisition community received an award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its reduction of ozonedepleting substances in weapons systems.

Undergirding  many  of  these  environmental  efforts  was  the Army' s Environmental  Management  System  (EMS).  Begun  in  2003,  EMS mandated  individual  Army-directed  installations  to  work  with  all  of their tenants, subinstallations, contractors, activities, products, and services to develop plans to build environmental protection practices and resource efficiencies into their regular operations. The plans also were to include reporting and outreach requirements with local communities and organizations, and to adhere to objectives in Executive Order 13423. The installations  were  to  base  these  plans  on  the  International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard, an internationally recognized approach that allowed organizations to establish their own systems, goals,

and monitoring programs.  This flexibility would permit the  Army to improve its environmental practices while maintaining its readiness requirements. By FY 2008, upwards of 149 Army facilities were implementing EMSs, and the service was planning to be in full conformance with ISO 14001 by the end of FY 2009.

Despite  the Army's  achievements,  during  the  year  the  EPA,  federal legislators, and a number of state governments accused the Army, along with  the  other  services,  of  making  insufficient  progress  in  remediating sites  on  the  EP A' s  National  Priorities  List  of  highly  polluted  locations. The Army had been responsible for thirty-three of these. In June, the EPA issued  'final  orders'  to  the  Pentagon  for  three  locations,  including  the Army's Fort Meade, Maryland, site, which established rigid timetables for the cleanup. The Army responded that it had worked voluntarily with the agency to complete remediation efforts at thirty-one sites, the most recent being  Fort  Eustis, Virginia,  in  March,  and  that  it  would  continue  these voluntary efforts. At Fort Meade, according to the service, it had spent more than $84 million since 1984 in remediation. Also, in September, the EPA proposed adding Fort Detrick, Maryland, to the cleanup list, initiating a sixty-day period for public comments before it would render a decision.

## Legal Affairs

The active Army Judge Advocate General's Corps included 1,647 attorneys, four more than in FY 2007. Five of these attorneys were general officers.  The  organization  also  had  another  fifty-eight  officers  who were attending law school under the Funded Legal Education Program. Indicative of the diversity of active Army attorney population, 678 were either minorities or women. In addition, the reserve component Judge Advocate General's Corps had 1,970 attorneys and the Army National Guard  had  574.  Another  90  warrant  officers,  515  civilian  attorneys, and  1,484  enlisted  paralegals  supported  legal  operations  worldwide. Altogether, 610 personnel had deployed during the year.

To help ensure the professionalism of this force, by 1 October 2008 the Judge Advocate General had expected to fully implement changes begun in 2006 to add ten weeks of training beyond the Officer Basic Course for newly commissioned judge advocates from all three Army components. The new training included the Direct Commissioned Officer' s Course and Branch Immaterial Basic Officer Leadership Course. Furthermore, the new judge advocates would have to complete twenty hours of online training known as the Judge Advocate Tactical Staff Officer Course within their first  two  years of service. In addition, the Criminal Law Department of the Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School in Charlottesville, Virginia,  increased  the  amount  of  advocacy  instruction  provided,  and

incorporated references to a new Article 120 rape statute of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that became effective 1 October 2007.

The Judge Advocate General implemented several significant military justice actions in FY 2008. He directed brigade combat teams and Offices of the Staff Judge Advocate to refine rating schemes and duty positions to ensure that commanders had proper and sufficient trial counsel services, and he had both organizations initiate a new skill identifier program to provide them with four graduated levels of professional recognition. In addition, as part of a new Sexual  Assault Prevention and Response Program initiated  by  the Army  in  September  2008,  the  Judge Advocate  General identified  judge  advocates to fill  five Trial  Counsel Assistance Program positions and fifteen new Special Victim Prosecutor positions; as well as seven  Highly  Qualified  Experts  to  improve  prosecution  and  defense  of sexual assault offenses.

The Criminal Law Division, which advises the Judge  Advocate General on military justice policy, legislation, opinions, and related criminal law actions, responded to 13 White House and 132 congressional and other inquiries; it handled 6 clemency petitions, 31 officer dismissals, and 131 Article 69 and other reviews; and it processed 18 Freedom of Information Act/Privacy actions.

The U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals/Office of the Clerk of Court received more than 900 records of trial and over 1,900 motions and briefs, while the Office of the Clerk of Court closed over 1,500 courts-martial cases. The Trial Judiciary tried nearly 1,200 courts-martial in FY 2008, a 10-percent decline from 2007, and Army trial judges presided over 130 general and special courts-martial in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, for a total of over 650 since May 2003. In addition, the first court-martial of a civilian contractor accompanying an armed force during a time of declared war or contingency operation pursuant to the newly enacted Article 2(a) (10) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was completed in Baghdad, Iraq. The accused pleaded guilty to wrongful appropriation, obstructing justice, and making a false official statement and was sentenced to five months of confinement. Finally, five trial judges were selected to preside as military judges for the military commissions convened in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The U.S. Army Trial Defense Service defended soldiers facing the entire range of allegations under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This  included 1,272 courts-martial,  461  administrative  boards,  41,227 nonjudicial punishments, and 34,620 consultations ( Table 4 ).

The U.S. Army Government Appellate Division filed 1,067 briefs and 14 oral arguments with the Army Court of Criminal Appeals. It also filed 19 briefs with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, along with 461 petitions and 25 oral arguments. The Defense Appellate Division provided

representation to qualifying soldiers, handling 900 new cases. Before the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, it filed 1,032 cases, 220 miscellaneous pleadings, and orally argued 18 cases. Before the Court of Appeals for the Armed  Forces,  it  filed  464  supplements  to  petitions  for  review,  13 final briefs, 153 miscellaneous pleadings, and it orally argued 16 cases. In addition, it filed 3 petitions for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. Cases of note included United States v. Balboa ,  in which the division filed an extraordinary writ challenging the constitutionality of  Article  120  relating  to  sexual  assault  of  an  impaired  victim;  and United States v. Mr. Muhammad Alaa Ali ,  in which the division filed an extraordinary writ on behalf of Mr. Ali, a Canadian-Iraqi tried at courtmartial  under  the  new Article  2,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice,  10 United States Code, Section 802(a)(10).

## Army Audit Agency

With  roughly  six hundred  professional employees  divided  into seventeen functional audit teams in FY 2008, the U.S. Army Audit Agency provided the Army with objective and independent reviews and analyses of its functions and organizations, thereby allowing them to make informed decisions  and  to  satisfy  their  statutory  and  fiduciary  responsibilities. During the fiscal year, the agency published 270 reports, made over 727 recommendations,  and  identified  more  than  $404  million  in  potential monetary benefits. Among some of the agency's more significant activities during the fiscal year was an audit it conducted of the U.S. Army Chemical Materials  Agency's  chemical  demilitarization  program,  a  $29  billion

operation  that  received  a  high  level  of  congressional  and  international attention. The Army Audit Agency found that while accounting procedures under  the  program  were  generally  adequate,  those  for  toxic  chemical munitions and bulk agents were not always accurate, and internal processes for records management were not fully effective. The agency also reviewed Army Travel  Charge  Card-Centrally  Billed  Accounts  and  found  that some Army activities were not making efficient use of new technologies to  avoid delinquent payments. As a result, the Army was losing special discounts  from  its  contractors.  One  of  the  agencies  more  significant ongoing audits was one of the military construction requirements under the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The agency issued recommendations  during  the  year  to  update  cost  estimates,  standard designs, automated systems, and military construction guidance. Finally, the agency assessed how the Army was implementing policies concerning the use of non-Department of Defense contracts. It found that many offices did not know about the policy or did not fully understand it. In response, the agency recommended that the secretary of the Army reissue guidance on the policy to give it greater visibility, and that the service recommend changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to deal with interagency contracting.

## 9 Conclusion

The Army weathered many adversities during FY 2008. The nation was  engaged  in  a  heated  presidential  election  campaign,  and  while  its political  leaders  fervently  debated  how  to  address  a  faltering  economy and how to prosecute wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the men and women of  the  U.S. Army continued to serve in those theaters and others. They and their families dealt with the stresses created by repeated and lengthy deployments, the loss of loved ones, and serious combat-related mental and physical injuries. The Army as an institution also struggled to cope with these personnel pressures while it attempted to maintain and improve its  equipment, and to enhance its readiness to respond to all spectrums of conflict. Complicating the situation further, the nation' s leaders were unable to agree on annual appropriations in a timely manner, forcing the service to scramble to find the funds it needed.

Even with  these  imposing  obstacles,  the  U.S. Army  made  progress on  a  number  of  its  pressing  issues.  For  soldiers  and  their  families,  it expanded  existing  programs,  and  it  instituted  a  number  of  innovative approaches to address mental and physical care. The service also made marked  improvements  in  recruiting  and  retention,  and  it  implemented policies to regularize deployment schedules to provide service members and  their  families  with  more  predictability.  Organizationally,  the Army began a major plan to re-station units that brought together ongoing efforts to  create  a  more  nimble  modular  force  structure,  to  expand  its  soldier base,  and  to  consolidate  installations  and  programs.  It  also  began  tests of  a  new  force  generation  model, ARFORGEN,  that  it  expected  would provide  a  predictable  stream  of  well-trained  and  well-equipped  troops for all of the nation' s contingencies. Doctrinally, the service issued a host of  major  publications,  including  FM  3-0, Operations ,  which  codified the concept of preparing the force for a full spectrum of operations. The service  also  made  great  strides  in  developing  new  weapons  systems, such as FCS, and accelerated the fielding of associated technologies to deployed soldiers. It fielded new MRAPs to provide better protection for deployed forces against roadside bombs, and it continued unprecedented efforts to repair and replace equipment worn in operations. Operationally, new  counterinsurgency  tactics  in  Iraq  helped  decrease  insurgent  and sectarian violence in the country, allowing for a significant reduction in U.S. force levels there by the year' s end. In Afghanistan, the Army worked

with its coalition partners to hold the line against a growing insurgency. Finally, it worked to convert the Guard and Reserve from a strategic to an operational reserve. All of these issues showed the Army' s continued commitment  to  improving  readiness  and  support  for  the  soldier  while conducting significant overseas combat operations and preparing the force for any future contingencies.
