## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2004

## Introduction

Fiscal  year  (FY)  2004  was  the  third  year  of  war  since  the  11 September 2001 terrorist attacks and the hardest one yet for the Army. By the start of the year, it had become clear that the optimistic plans for Operation IraqI Freedom had come undone and that the Army would have to devote a major part of its operational forces to a lengthy and costly counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq. The course of events during FY 2004 only confirmed this conclusion. At the same time, the Army had to provide units for coalition operations in Afghanistan, stability  operations  in  the  Balkans,  and  various  defense  security missions in the United States.

The scale of these commitments made them the first large-scale long-term ones for the all-volunteer force and placed severe strains on all three components of the Army. The magnitude of these strains was reflected in a number of major changes to the way the service managed its personnel, procured materiel, and shaped the relationships between the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The war, unfortunately, also created the opportunity for a few soldiers to violate the values that the service stands for.

In addition to the war, the service's senior leadership during FY 2004 remained deeply involved in the continuing effort to transform the  Army  into  a  service  better  suited  for  the  conditions  of  a  postCold War world. Still, wartime requirements affected the course of transformation during the fiscal year, as they prompted a shift in the focus of transformation from the long term to the near- and mid-term in order to better support forces in the field. The war's pressures on the Army's human and fiscal resources also influenced decisions made about the future force.

## ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT, AND BUDGET

Organizational Changes

Since 1999, the Army had been working to transform itself into a  force  suited  for  the  post-Cold  War  operational  environment.  The objective  for  transformation  was  to  build  a  campaign-quality  Army with joint and expeditionary capabilities to provide relevant and ready land power to combatant commanders and the joint force while sustaining operational support to combatant commanders and maintaining the quality of the all-volunteer force. In April 2004, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3, published the Army Campaign Plan, which  superseded  the  Army  Transformation  Campaign  Plan.  The new campaign plan directed the planning, preparation, and execution of Army operations and Army transformation for the next six years. Army  strategic  commitments  and  resource  availability  dictated  the synchronization and pace of change, and the plan directed this change through the efforts of all Army major commands; the Headquarters, Department of the Army staff; and supporting agencies and activities. The plan also directed, prioritized, and synchronized efforts to transform while sustaining operation  al support to combatant commanders and maintaining the quality of the all-volunteer force.

The  Army's  transformation  strategy  had  three  components. The first was to transform the culture of the service from one based on preparing to fight the Soviet Union in set-piece battles to one based on an expeditionary force that was ready to go anywhere in the world, at any time, in any environment, against any adversary to ac  complish the assigned mission as part of a joint force under a combatant command. The second was to transform the processes by which the Army operated, from tactical doctrine to personnel management to equipment acquisition. The third was to transform capabilities, building a force that integrated into joint and coalition organizations, and could preempt enemy actions, seize the initiative, and through multiple simultaneous actions rapidly achieve the enemy's operational disintegra  tion.

Transformation underwent a significant shift in emphasis in its near- and mid-term focus during FY 2004. Before Operation IraqI Freedom, the  Army  assumed  greater  risk  in  the  current  force  by focusing its modernization efforts on creating the future force. The shift since the start of the Iraq war was based on operational necessity and the March 2004 strategic planning guidance issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This shift will accelerate fielding available, next-generation capabilities to the current force for use in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of fielding them only with the future force. The Army Campaign Plan published in April sought to balance the re  source commitments to sustained war fighting with transforming to meet future challenges.

During the fiscal year, the Army went without a permanent civilian leader. In May 2003, the secretary of the Army, Thomas E. White, had  resigned  and  the  under  secretary  of  the  Army,  Romie  'Les' Brownlee, had become the acting secretary. In July 2003, President George W. Bush nominated the secretary of the Air Force, James G. Roche, to be the next secretary of the Army. As secretary of the Air Force, Roche had promoted a plan to lease aerial refueling aircraft and this action generated significant friction with several senators. They blocked Senate consideration of his move to the new position and this opposition led Roche to withdraw his nomination in March 2004. In September, the president nominated Francis J. Harvey to serve as the secretary of the Army.

The Army continued its work on the active and reserve components rebalance initiative during FY 2004. This initiative was an incremental, ongoing process that had evolved over time to hasten the transformation of the post-Cold War Army into a force suited for the new strategic environment. The major tenets of this initiative included increasing capabilities to relieve stress on units; minimizing the need for involuntary  mobilizations  of  reserve  component  forces  during  the  initial phase of an operational deployment; and adjusting the balance among the  components  to  maximize  readiness  and  rotational  availability while preserving reserve component capabilities for homeland defense. Beginning in 2001, the Army reprogrammed over 30,000 spaces, in the active and reserve components, from lower-priority to higher-priority areas. The reprogrammed spaces were to provide additional capabilities in the areas of civil affairs, psychological operations, special operational forces, intelligence, and military police.

Rebalancing  received  additional  emphasis  following  a  July  2003 memorandum by the secretary of defense. The memorandum warned that the operational tempo was beginning to stress the reserve components, and it established planning considerations to govern future rebalancing decisions by setting two objectives: structure the force to reduce  dependence  on  involuntary  mobilization  of  reservists  during the initial fifteen days of a rapid-response operation and limit involuntary mobilization to one year out of every six. Following this guidance, the Army rebalanced an additional 10,000 spaces to reduce reliance on reserve component capabilities in the initial phase of an operational deployment. Concurrent implementation of the earlier transformationbased rebalancing changes continued throughout FY 2004.

The secretary of defense in June 2003 had directed the military services to create a joint headquarters in the National Capital Region for homeland defense and military assistance to civil authorities. The Military District of Washington was charged with standing up Joint Force  Headquarters-National  Capital  Region  (JFHQ-NCR)  as  a subcommand of U.S. Northern Command. In September 2004, the new headquarters was activated. The Military District of Washington is the Army force under JFHQ-NCR, and the two organizations share a single commander and core staff to support both ceremonial and contingency missions.

In June 2004, the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems was realigned from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) to the Office of the Chief Information Officer/G-6. This realignment established the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems as the coordinating office for all acquisition efforts related to the

service's digital networks. A main reason for the realignment was that the acquisition staff in the assistant secretary's office had to devote much of their effort to major weapons systems. Placing the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems under the Office of the Chief Information Officer will provide a better integration of Army business systems and communications networks.

The Realignment Task Force, established in FY 2001, had examined  Army  functions  with  the  objective  of  eliminating  duplication and streamlining operations to the extent feasible by law. The task force had directed two major changes for the U.S. Army War College. The first was to move the college from under the supervision of Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This change became effective  on  1  October  2003.  Second, the task force had concluded that the U.S. Army War College's Peacekeeping Institute should be eliminated because its activities did not fall under the purposes for which  the  War  College  had  been  established.  The  Army  therefore announced in January 2003 that the institute would be closed by the end of FY 2003. This decision came under increasing criticism from both inside and outside the service as Army forces sought to cope with insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the continuing stability operations in the Balkans. In October 2003, senior leaders decided to reverse the decision. Furthermore, the institute's mission, budget, and staffing would be expanded in FY 2004. The new mission was to study the strategic implications of stability operations, help senior Army leaders understand and deal with those implications, and explore the impact of international organizations, foreign governments,  and  nongovernmental  organizations.  The  expanded mission  also  included  greater  cooperation  with  the  other  military services and relevant civilian agencies of the federal government. To reflect these changes, the institute was renamed the U.S. Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute.

The U.S. Army Human Resources Command (HRC) was established on 1 October 2003 by merging the U.S. Total Army Personnel Command in Alexandria, Virginia, and the U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Command in St. Louis, Missouri. This merger was part of the Army's transformation into a post-Cold War force and allows the  Department  of  the  Army  to  manage  all  of  its  federal  military personnel under one command. Effective 2 October 2003, the new command was designated as a field operating agency of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, Headquarters, Department of the Army. The HRC commander will serve as the G-1's functional proponent for military personnel management (except for personnel of

the Judge Advocate General and the Chaplain Branch) and personnel systems, and commands the Individual Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. The HRC commander also supports the G-1 in the management of all military personnel serving on active duty or retired and supports the director of the Army National Guard and the chief of the Army Reserve in their management of the Selected Reserve.

In October 2003, civilian personnel and associated functions were realigned. Placed under the U.S. Army Civilian Human Resources Agency were civilian personnel operations centers, civilian personnel advisory centers, and the Civilian Personnel Field Activity. The realignment was to improve the effectiveness of the civilian employee recruiting, training, education, and development system by placing all its functions under one organization. The Civilian Human Resources Agency is a field operating agency of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, and serves appropriated fund, nonappropriated fund, and local national civilian employees. The agency is expected to become part of the Human Resources Command in 2006.

To accelerate the Army's transformation process and to enhance the credibil  ity  of  its  transformation initiatives, TRADOC in October 2003 established the Futures Center. The center's mission was to serve  as  the  service's  integrating  center  for  all  work  on  developing the  future  force,  including  new  materiel,  doctrine,  training,  facilities, and personnel. As part of this mission, the center was to serve as the Army's central node for coordinating these matters with the other services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, industry, and allied armies. The new organization was comprised of several offices from the TRADOC staff and a 'forward element' in the Washington, D.C., area created using the existing Objective Force Task Force. The forward element was the center's representative in the National Capital Region, participating in Army, joint, and interagency staff activities, and also working on strategic communications efforts with Army audiences and those outside the service.

## Management Systems

Implementation of the public key infrastructure (PKI) technology had been scheduled for completion in FY 2004. In late in FY 2003, however, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness moved the deadline for full fielding of the common access card from October 2003 to April 2004. The delay was necessary because more time was needed to develop methods for issuing cards. The Army's chief information officer issued guidance that organizations would

complete initial issue of the cards by April 2004. Furthermore, the chief information officer directed that units not deployed would fully field card readers and other associated PKI middleware by October 2004. Deployed units would have from six months after their return to home station to complete reader and middleware installation. The guidance also mandated that as soon as they were issued full PKI capability,  Army users were to digitally sign official  emails,  which required nonrepudiation and data integrity, and they were to encrypt emails containing sensitive information, that is, information classified  'for  official  use  only'  or  containing  material  protected by the Privacy Act of 1974.

In February 2004, the Army announced that LandWarNet would be the name for its network enterprise, from sustaining military bases to  forward-deployed  forces,  integrating  the  service's  information architecture and decentralizing battle command. LandWarNet is the combination of information structure and services across the Army that provides for processing, storing, and transporting information over a seamless network. The network had several elements. The first provided installation connectivity to the global information grid; the National Guard's GuardNET and the Army Reserve's ARNET are both part of LandWarNet at this level. The second provided echelonsabove-corps connectivity to the global information grid, supporting combatant  commanders,  land-component  commanders,  and  joint force commanders. The third was echelons-at-corps-and-below connectivity to the global information grid for deployed corps, division, and  brigade  headquarters.  When  fielded,  the  Warfighter  Information Network-Tactical, the Joint Tactical Radio System, the Transformational  Communications  System,  the  global  information  grid bandwidth expansion, and network-centric enterprise services will be integral parts of LandWarNet.

The Army introduced initiatives to provide more timely and accurate accounting information and to enhance the quality of financial management decisions. The Army Managerial Accounting Division was established to use Army Shared Knowledge-Financial Management and other analytical tools to improve the effectiveness of budget execution.  The  Army  Shared  Knowledge-Financial  Management, fielded in May 2004, was a Web-based business intelligence application designed to provide access to near real-time data for accounting, disbursements, logistics, entitlements, pay, and other purposes.

The  Army  identified  one  new  management  control  weakness during  FY  2004,  logistics  asset  visibility  and  accountability.  The Army did not have adequate visibility over all requisitions, equipment, and supplies transported to, from, and within theaters of oper-

ation, nor across the Army. For an extended period during Operation IraqI Freedom, a discrepancy of $1.2 billion worth of supplies existed between what was shipped to Army activities in theater and what was acknowledged as received by those activities. That discrepancy was reduced to $375 million by the end of FY 2004. Corrective measures, including new technologies, training, and doctrine, are expected to eliminate this weakness by the end of FY 2008.

## Budget

When it was submitted to Congress in February 2003, the Army's budget request for FY 2004 was $3 billion more than the funds appropriated for FY 2003 ( Table 1 ). The request was prepared with the central theme of meeting today's threats while preparing for tomorrow's challenges. The unplanned need to keep a large force in Iraq to counter the growing insurgency, together with the policy of the Office of the Secretary of Defense not to program wartime requirements into budget requests, threatened a shortfall in funding during FY 2004. In November 2003, Congress approved a supplemental appropriations act  for  the  FY  2004  national  defense  budget,  which  permitted  the Army to continue combat operations while adequately funding transformation  initiatives.  The  service's  share  of  the  supplemental  was apportioned into several budget accounts: Military Personnel, Army, $2.9 billion; Operation and Maintenance, Army, $24 billion; Procurement of Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles, Army, $102 million; Other Procurement, Army, $1 billion; Military Construction, Army, $162  million;  and  Family  Housing  Operation  and  Maintenance, Army, $11 million. The supplemental also transferred money from the Iraqi Freedom Fund to the Army: not less than $62 million was moved into the Other Procurement, Army, account for the procurement of up-armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and associated equipment, and $10 million was set aside for  the  National  Guard's family readiness program. In addition to these amounts, the act appropriated $47 million to the Operation and Maintenance, Army, account for recovery and repair of damage due to natural disasters.

Submitted in February 2004, the FY 2005 budget request had several themes: provide ready land force capabilities to combatant commanders; provide soldiers with the best available capabilities to conduct operations; take care of soldiers and their families; enhance installations as power projections and support platforms; develop the Future Combat Systems (FCS) and its complementary systems; and sustain the commitment to field six Stryker brigade combat teams ( Table 2 ).

Source : Maj. Gen. Lynn Hartsell, Director, Army Budget, FY 05 Amended Budget Overview, 25 Feb 2004.

This request will provide for an end strength of 482,400 in the active component, 350,000 in the Army National Guard, and 205,000 in  the  Army  Reserve.  The  Army's  request  reflects  the  increase  of 2,400 in the active component as authorized in the FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act. The Army's FY 2005 authorized civilian end strength is projected to be 229,000.

Unit ground training is measured in miles driven with actual equipment and in simulators. For FY 2005, this budget supports a Regular Army training tempo of 804 miles with actual equipment and 95 miles in simulators. The training tempo for Army National Guard enhanced brigades  is  281  total  miles,  while  Army  National  Guard  divisional units have 135 total miles. Army Reserve units will receive 199 total miles. Aviation training is measured in crew flying hours. In FY 2005, Regular Army units will be budgeted 13.1 live flying hours per aircrew per month, while reserve component units will receive 6.6 live aircrew flying hours. This budget request will fund ten brigade rotations (nine for the Regular Army and one for the Army National Guard) at the National Training Center; ten brigade rotations (nine for the Regular Army and one for the Army National Guard) at the Joint Readiness Training Center; and five brigade rotations (all for the Regular Army) through the Combat Maneuver Training Center. The Battle Command Training Program will conduct one corps-level exercise and train eleven division command and staff groups in FY 2005.

The FY 2005 depot maintenance program is funded at 72 percent of requirements, while the recapitalization rebuild program continues to be funded fully, supporting seventeen systems. The budget will provide for the operation of twelve ships in the afloat pre-positioned stocks program, which is the service's initial effort to reset and reorganize  Army  Pre-positioned  Stocks  (APS)  sets  based  on  the  new modular unit organization and the new Army regional flotilla concept. In FY 2005, facilities sustainment will be funded at 95 percent of requirements, while base operations support will be funded at 70 percent of requirements.

To balance a reasonable degree of risk between the readiness of the  current  force  and  investments  in  the  capabilities  for  the  future force, the FY 2005 budget terminates fourteen systems and restructures fifteen systems to realign $406.5 million. Major research, development, and acquisition efforts during this fiscal year will  include the Future Combat Systems; fielding the fifth Stryker brigade combat team;  aviation  modernization;  continued  procurement  of  Patriot Advanced  Capability-3  (PAC-3)  missiles;  continued  procurement of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles; and procurement of uparmored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles.

The FY 2005 military construction budget provides new and renovated military facilities for the active and the reserve components. The program for barracks replacement and upgrade is fully funded. Construction at installations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Louisiana for Stryker brigade combat teams will support Army transformation.

In  accordance  with  the  secretary  of  defense's  guidance,  this budget  request  does  not  include  funds  for  Operations endurIng Freedom and IraqI Freedom . Instead, the costs for these wars will be covered by a supplemental appropriations request during FY 2005.

## Personnel

Army Strength

The  active  Army's  strength  in  September  2004  totaled  494,291 personnel:  68,634  commissioned  officers,  12,142  warrant  officers, and 413,515 enlisted soldiers. This was an increase of 728 personnel from the FY 2003 strength. Minorities constituted 39.9 percent of the active Army and women 14.7 percent.

The Army National Guard's strength in September 2004 totaled 342,918 personnel: 29,806 commissioned officers, 6,878 warrant officers, and 306,234 enlisted soldiers. This was a decrease of 8,171 from the  FY  2003  strength.  Minorities  constituted  26.4  percent  of  the Army National Guard and women 12.8 percent.

The Army Reserve's strength in September 2004 totaled 204,131 personnel:  35,828  commissioned  officers,  2,522  warrant  officers, and 165,781 enlisted soldiers. This was a decrease of 7,759 from the FY 2003 strength. Minorities constituted 40.8 percent of the Army

Reserve and women 23.6 percent.

In January 2004, the chief of staff of the Army, General Peter J. Schoomaker,  requested  and the secretary of defense approved a temporary increase of 30,000 in the  service's  active  end  strength through 2008. The increase was to make it easier for the Army to convert to the new modular, brigade-based organization while fighting  two  wars  and  supporting other overseas commitments. General Schoomaker opposed efforts  in  Congress  to  make  the increase permanent, arguing that it would be more prudent to reassess the situation once the transformation to a modular force had

General Schoomaker



been completed. A permanent increase could leave the service with personnel expenses so great that they would force cutbacks in training and modernization spending. The Army will obtain the additional 30,000 soldiers through a combination of higher recruiting goals and increased retention objectives.

## Enlisted Personnel

In FY 2004, the service met almost all its recruiting objectives, as shown in Table 3.

The active Army met its accession goal, however, by dipping into the Delayed Entry Program and sending to basic training in FY 2004 recruits it had originally scheduled to send in FY 2005. The service had planned to start the FY 2005 accession cycle with 25 percent of its goal for that year already enrolled in the Delayed Entry Program, but it began the year with only 18.4 percent.

The quality of non-prior-service enlisted accessions for the active Army exceeded the goals set by the Department of Defense that 90 percent of recruits should be high school graduates and at least 60 percent should score at or above the fiftieth percentile (relative to the general population) on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. In FY 2004,  92  percent  of  these  recruits  were  high  school  graduates,  the same percentage as in FY 2003, and 72 percent scored at or above the fiftieth percentile on the test, a decline from the 73 percent result the previous fiscal year.

In FY 2002, the active Army exceeded its enlisted retention goals, as shown in Table 4.

In  January 2004, the Human Resources Command announced that  900  detailed  recruiters  who  were  scheduled  to  return  to  their regular duties between February and December 2004 would instead be  involuntarily  extended  for  an  additional  year  in  the  Recruiting

Command. Detailed recruiters are not soldiers who hold the recruiter military occupational specialty. Rather, they are noncommissioned officers  with  other  specialties  who  are  put  through  a  special  training course before being assigned to a recruiter position. The Human Resources Command directed the extension because with so many soldiers under stop-loss or stop-movement orders, it could not find replacements  for  these  detailed  recruiters.  Exempt  from  extension were soldiers selected for a special operations accession course, soldiers with certain specialties with assignment orders for the Republic of Korea, and soldiers on assignment orders to a Stryker brigade combat team, the 1st Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, and the 25th Infantry Division.

In August 2004, to help with the recruiting effort necessary to fill the 30,000 increase in the active component's strength, the Human Resources Command identified seventy-one noncommissioned officers stationed in the United States who had previously served a 36-month tour as a detailed recruiter. These soldiers, who as veterans of a previous recruiting tour would not need to attend a training course, were reassigned to recruiting duties for a twelve-month tour within fifty miles of their current location. This distance was used to avoid any permanent-change-of-station moves for soldiers and their families. The following month, the Army began the Special Recruiter Assistance  Program.  Under  this  program,  young  enlisted  soldiers returning from a tour in Iraq or Afghanistan could volunteer for temporary duty in their hometowns assisting recruiters.

At the start of the fiscal year, there was a shortage of soldiers with the recruiter military occupation specialty (MOS) in the Recruiting Command-less than 85 percent of its authorized strength in this specialty. To increase this percentage, the Army initially asked current and former detailed recruiters to volunteer for reclassification into the  recruiter  MOS.  So  few  noncommissioned  officers  volunteered,

however, that late in FY 2004 the service announced that over 400 soldiers  currently  serving  or  who  had  served  as  detailed  recruiters would be involuntarily reclassified as recruiters. These noncommissioned officers will serve as recruiting station commanders, guidance counselors, recruiter trainers, and operations sergeants in Recruiting  Command  units.  Most  of  the  soldiers  selected  were  sergeants first class in overstrength specialties or in specialties scheduled to be phased out.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense affected Army recruiting during FY 2004 when it decided that the norms for the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) needed to be changed. The ASVAB is a multiple aptitude test battery to predict training and job  performance  in  military  occupations.  Since  its  introduction  in 1948, the enlistment test norms have been updated three times. Test scores of military applicants are compared with the scores of a representative  sample  weighted  to  reflect  all  recruitment-age  men  and women.  Consequently,  enlistment  decisions  are  based  on  the  relative performance of the applicant compared with the youth population from which the applicant was recruited. These reference group scores are called norms. The last change in ASVAB norms occurred in 1980, and they no longer accurately reflected the aptitude of today's youth. The updated ASVAB will reflect more current norms based on the 1997 Profile of American Youth, a national probability sample of eighteen to twenty-three year olds in 1997. Under the new norms, 3 percent fewer applicants will be designated as 'high quality.' The change went into effect on 1 July 2004. Persons who had taken the test before 1 July and who had valid scores were grandfathered.

Recruiting advertising changed during FY 2004 to reflect that the Army was now at war. After becoming chief of staff in August 2003, General Schoomaker had created Task Force Warrior with the mission of devising ways to improve soldiers' readiness for the battlefield by cultivating a 'warrior ethos.' One of the task force's findings was that current recruiting advertising focused on the benefits of service, particularly  monetary  rewards  and  mastering  technical  skills  that were in demand in the civilian world. Recruitment advertising did not mention that even soldiers in support units could find themselves engaged in close combat, as was occurring in Iraq. The new television ads featured footage of soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the soldiers talking about what it was like to serve in a war zone.

In March 2004, the Location Selective Reenlistment Bonus program began. The program's objective was to encourage soldiers to reenlist for assignments with the 3d Infantry Division, which was the first  unit  to  transform into the new modular organization, and the

2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, which was slated to reorganize into the service's fourth Stryker brigade combat team. The program will help improve cohesion in these units by providing them with a group of soldiers who will remain with them from their reorganization to their next combat deployment. Eligibility for the bonus was limited to certain specialties and grades most needed by the units.

The  decision  to  expand  the  active  component  end  strength  by 30,000 meant that the FY 2005 retention goal was larger than in FY 2004.  To  achieve  that  goal,  the  Army  in  August  2004  introduced new reenlistment incentives. It increased the amounts soldiers could receive  under  the  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  program.  Bonuses now ranged from $10,000 to $40,000, depending on rank, specialty, time in service,  and  duty  location  for  which  the  soldier  reenlisted. Furthermore, instead of paying out the bonus over the duration of the enlistment, the Army would now pay the entire bonus as a lump sum at the time of reenlistment.

The  Human  Resources  Command  fielded  several  Web-based initiatives  for  the  career  management  of  enlisted  soldiers.  One was to provide soldiers with reassignment notification through an Army Knowledge Online email; this enabled soldiers to know of their  orders  at  the  same  time  their  personnel  office  receives  notification  from  the  Human  Resources  Command.  With  this  initiative, the Human Resources Command phased out the use of paper assignment notices. Soldiers would now receive email reminders to update their assignment preferences and contact information in the Assignment  Preference  Key  program,  which  was  established  two years earlier. The Personnel Data Lookup initiative would permit soldiers access to the data in their personnel files used by assignment managers and professional development officers at the Human Resources Command.

The  activation  of  more  brigade  combat  teams  as  part  of  the Army's transition to a modular force structure required more noncommissioned  officers  than  currently  on  hand.  In  response,  the Human Resources Command in FY 2004 advanced the date for convening selection boards for sergeant first class and master sergeant; the former moved from February 2005 to November 2004, while the latter  moved  from  October  to  September  2004.  Another  measure taken  by  the  command  to  supply  the  new  brigade  combat  teams with sufficient noncommissioned officers was to withdraw approval authority from commanders for retirement requests from sergeants first class and above. The intent of having the command now approve these requests was to defer them long enough to backfill the position held by the requesting noncommissioned officer.

To support the transformation to a modular force structure, the Human  Resources  Command  developed  the  Personnel  Lifecycle Unit Selection System, known as PLUS2. Its purpose was to reduce non-volunteer permanent-change-of-station moves and provide an easy method of requesting assignments. Before divisions and separate brigades begin the transition to the new modular organization, the Human Resources Command posts on its Web site a list of vacant positions in the units and establishes a window of time soldiers can volunteer for those positions. Soldiers may only select positions  for  which  they  are  qualified.  Once  the  window  closes, the command reviews the applications and picks soldiers to fill the positions. Personnel officials send a formal assignment notification to  chosen  soldiers  and  an  email  to  the  Army  Knowledge  Online accounts of the soldiers who were not selected. During FY 2004, the Human Resources Command opened two PLUS2 windows. The first, in May, was for units of the 10th Mountain and the 101st Airborne Divisions. The second, in September, was for units of the 4th Infantry and the 10th Mountain Divisions.

## Officer Personnel

During FY 2004, the Human Resources Command modified the criteria used to assign officers to the command of operational battalions and brigades. These changes will be applied beginning with officers selected for the FY 2005 command lists. Previously, the command had given significant consideration to officers' preferences for which type of unit and its location. Now, the command will give greater consideration to other criteria. First, it will seek to match officers with the same or similar type of unit in which they had the most field-grade service. Second, it will seek to assign as unit commanders those officers with the most time in troop units while a field grade. Third, whenever possible, officers who have already served a tour in a combat zone will be assigned to command a unit expected to deploy within the next two years. Fourth (and this applies as well to those sent to command training units), the command will try to minimize the number of officers who would require a permanent change of station for their new assignment.

In  August  2004,  the  Human  Resources  Command  announced a change to the officer evaluation report system that would become effective in FY 2005: senior raters would no longer provide a 'box check'  rating  comparing  junior  warrant  officers,  lieutenants,  and captains to peers of the same rank in the promotion potential section of the report. Senior raters had been required to check one of four boxes and no more than 49 percent of their subordinates could

receive the highest rating. The box check was eliminated for four reasons. The concern was that it encouraged a 'zero defects' mentality among junior officers. Promotion boards could better assess potential because of the high quality of narrative comments by senior raters. The  transition  to  the  Intermediate  Level  of  Education  mid-career course program eliminated the need to winnow junior officers to find the  50  percent  for  attendance  at  the  Command  and  General  Staff College. Current promotion rates to captain and major exceeded 90 percent and made the box check unnecessary. The box check rating will  remain  in  effect  for  majors  through  brigadier  general  and  for chief warrant officers 2, 3, and 4.

In June 2004, the Training and Doctrine Command directed the Army War College to study the post-initial entry officer education system. The Agile Leader Study's charter was to assess the system's curricula and the combat training centers' training environments to determine how well suited they are for developing leaders to operate effectively in the contemporary operational environment. Research has shown that many junior officers displayed great agility in dealing with the new challenges of combat in Operations IraqI Freedom and endurIng Freedom . The study sought to determine whether this performance was simply individual talent or whether officer institutional training and education instilled the necessary traits. Another objective of the study was researching how the system can better prepare officers  for  service  in  the  contemporary  operational  environment. Completion of the study was expected in early FY 2005.

On 9 July 2004, the eighty-sixth anniversary of the warrant officer corps' establishment, the Army changed the insignia worn by these officers. Previously, they had worn the 'Eagle Rising' collar and lapel device, but after this date they wore the colors and insignia of their branch. This change, proposed by a 2002 Army Leaders Development Panel report, recognized that warrant officers are now branch focused much like commissioned officers and helped integrate the two types into a single officer corps. Warrant officers will wear branch insignia determined by their primary occupational specialty.

## Civilian Personnel

At the end of FY 2004, the strength of Army civilian personnel who supported military functions was 227,571. An additional 24,035 civilian personnel supported the Army's civil works functions. Over 1,950 Army civilian personnel deployed overseas during FY 2004, mostly  in  support  of  Operations endurIng  Freedom and IraqI Freedom .  The average age of the civilian workforce has continued

to rise since the end of the Cold War, from forty-three in FY 1989 to forty-seven in FY 2004. Average years of service during the same period increased from 13.5 to 16.4.

The acting secretary of the Army in late FY 2004 approved the conversion  of  8,360  military  positions  to  civilian  positions  in  FY 2005. The military personnel positions released by these conversions will be used to support the switch to a modular force structure and the activation of new brigade combat teams. To date, the Army has documented 6,853 positions for conversion in FY 2005. The ultimate objective is to convert about 15,000 positions from military to civilian as part of the Army transformation campaign.

The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2004 authorized the creation of the National Security Personnel System. The goals of this system are to increase flexibility in hiring and assignment to reshape the workforce and meet changing mission requirements; to create a pay structure that supports latitude to adjust work assignments and organizational structures; to improve performance by establishing a pay-for-performance system; and to increase managerial  and  employee  accountability.  During  FY  2004,  a  program manager and staff were assigned to manage Army actions associated with design and implementation of the system. The Army had twelve participants on the design work groups established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a two-month effort to develop and evaluate potential design features.

## Wartime Personnel Actions

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were important factors affecting  personnel  operations  during  FY  2004.  In  October  2003,  the Human Resources Command directed that battalions and brigades deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan will have their commanders stabilized during their deployment to those countries. General officers with  command  authority  over  the  deployed  units  will  determine whether to change commanders, and any requests to do so will have to be approved by the chief of staff of the Army. Any officer whose command tenure was extended because of this new policy beyond its typical length will have to give up command no more than ninety days after the unit returns to its home station.

The Army issued stop-loss orders in November 2003 to active component units scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait during 2004. Stop-loss is a program that enables the service to retain soldiers who are determined to be essential to the national security of the United States beyond their date of retirement, separation, or release

from active duty. Soldiers scheduled to separate within ninety days of their unit's deployment date were affected by these orders, which also direct that these soldiers remain with their unit for ninety days after it returns to home station. Not covered by the program were soldiers selected  for  involuntary  separation.  Unlike  earlier  stop-loss  orders, these orders were not specialty-specific. At the same time, the Army placed  these  units  under  stop-movement  orders,  which  prohibit  the rotation of almost all soldiers from the unit for another assignment. Exempt from the stop-movement orders were soldiers selected for the Bonus Extension and Retraining Program, a special operations accession  course,  the  Warrant  Officer  Candidate  Course,  Officer  Candidate School, and Army Medical Department courses, and soldiers on assignment orders to a Stryker brigade combat team.

Stop-loss and stop-movement were extended in January 2004 to units already deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The reason for this change was that during the summer of 2003 thousands of soldiers, including many in leadership positions, had been transferred out of these units as part of the regular peacetime reassignment process. Commanders in theater argued that applying this process damaged cohesion and effectiveness at a time when these units needed to sustain the highest possible readiness. Exempt from the change were soldiers selected for a special operations accession course, the Warrant Officer Candidate Course, Officer Candidate School, and Army Medical Department courses, and soldiers with a sufficiently compelling need for compassionate reassignment. In June 2004, the Army made stop-loss and stop-movement a part of active component units' deployment cycle for all future rotations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The  decision  to  increase  the  active  Army  strength  by  30,000 forced the service to modify stop-movement in August 2004. Added to the list of soldiers exempt from this policy were those on orders for recruiting and drill sergeant duties. These exemptions were necessary so that there would be sufficient noncommissioned officers to obtain and train the new soldiers needed to meet the new authorized strength in a timely manner.

The Assignment Incentive  Pay  program  was  a  response  to  the difficulties  of  supporting  other  overseas  commitments  while  fielding full-strength units in Iraq and Afghanistan. This program aimed to improve readiness in units stationed in the Republic of Korea by reducing the personnel turbulence created by the one-year tour most soldiers  served  in  that  country.  Stabilizing  units  there  would  also help reduce personnel turbulence in divisions and brigades in Europe and the United States that usually provided replacements for units in Korea but which were now focused on deploying units to combat

zones. The program provided soldiers extra pay every month if they agreed to extend their tour in Korea for twelve months or more. Both soldiers already in Korea and those on orders to Korea could apply. There were no grade or specialty restrictions on who could volunteer for the incentive. The program was scheduled to end in March 2005.

In April 2004, the commander of American forces in Iraq postponed the redeployment of about 20,000 soldiers, mostly from the 1st  Armored Division and the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, for three months. These units were needed for operations to counter an upsurge in  violence  by  insurgent  forces.  Several  thousand  of  these soldiers had been on orders for permanent-change-of-station moves following redeployment. Instead of canceling these orders, soldiers received  new  reporting  dates  based  on  the  tour  extension  plus  a ninety-day stabilization period at the home station following redeployment. Soldiers slated for professional development courses were shifted to a new class date. Officers selected for a command and staff college  or  senior  service  college  course  took  the  scheduled  class. No changes were made to reporting dates for soldiers on orders for the  extended  units.  All  soldiers  involuntarily  extended  received  an extra $1,000 per month ($200 in extra hardship-duty pay and $800 in assignment incentive pay) while serving in Iraq beyond their scheduled rotation date.

The pace of deployments forced the suspension of conditional noncommissioned officer promotions in January 2004. Conditional promotions are those given to a soldier who has not yet graduated from the noncommissioned officer professional development course associated with that rank. Under this policy, such promotions were conditioned on  the  soldier  graduating  from  the  required  course  within  twelve months. If the soldier did not do so, then the promotion was rescinded. The greatly increased operational tempo after the 11 September 2001 terrorist  attacks,  along  with  stop-movement  orders  and  an  inability to expand the noncommissioned officer education system, meant that more soldiers either lost their promotions or were in danger of losing them because of the growing waiting list for professional development courses. The suspension of conditional promotions, however, was not retroactive; those soldiers who had lost their promotions prior to the change will have to be reconsidered by a new promotion board.

## Special Topics

In  April  2004,  the  Department  of  the  Army  established  the Disabled Soldier Support System in response to the needs of the most severely wounded, injured, or ill soldiers-those who have received a

disability rating of 30 percent or greater and are in a special category as a result of wounds, injuries, or illness incurred since 11 September 2001.  Medical  conditions  in  this  program  included  severe  injury, such as loss of sight or limb; permanent and unsightly disfigurement of  a  portion  of  the  body  normally  exposed  to  view;  incurable  and fatal  disease  with  limited  life  expectancy;  established  psychiatric condition;  paralysis;  and  the  need  for  extensive  medical  treatment and  hospitalization.  Rather  than  introducing  a  new  service,  the program  served  as  a  clearinghouse  for  services  already  available through the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program provided a system of advocacy and support for disabled soldiers to assist in meeting their financial, administrative, medical, vocational, and other needs. It also helped them sort out the medical and vocational entitlements and other benefits for which they qualify. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, established the Disabled Soldier Support System task force to manage the program.

Shortly before his retirement, the previous chief of staff of the Army, General Eric K. Shinseki, had initiated the Warrior Ethos Study to better define for the service what soldiering meant in the post-Cold  War  era.  When  General  Schoomaker  became  chief  of staff in August 2003, he established a number of task forces to work on areas he believed to be of critical importance to the Army. One of Task Force Soldier's missions was to continue and expand on the Warrior  Ethos  Study.  The  task  force  produced  a  Soldier's  Creed and a Warrior Ethos, the latter being incorporated into the former. Schoomaker  approved  both  the  creed  and  the  ethos  in  November 2003 and directed that they be given the widest dissemination across  the  Army  and  that  training  on  them  be  incorporated  into initial entry training programs and the officer, warrant officer, and noncommissioned officer education systems. Late in FY 2004, the Army began issuing a new tag with the Warrior Ethos on one side and the Army Values on the other to be worn on the same chain with soldiers' two identification tags.

The Army in FY 2004 began implementing two force stabilization initiatives for the active component to promote unit cohesion and to provide soldiers and their families increased predictability while assigned to units in the United States. These initiatives were the product of Task Force Stabilization, established by General Schoomaker in  September 2003. The task force's recommendations were to stabilize individual soldiers as much as possible at one installation for much longer periods and to implement unit-focused stabilization, a long-term plan to align soldier assignment and unit operational cycles in brigade combat teams.

Stabilizing  soldiers  will  require  moving  them  only  when  necessary to support the needs of the Army, leader development, and soldier  preferences.  Stabilization  allows  soldiers  to  stay  together in  teams  longer,  improving  combat  readiness  and  cohesion  while increasing  stability  and  predictability  for  soldiers  and  their  families. Families can develop deeper roots in their community, providing them a well-developed support network to help them, especially during soldiers' deployments. Soldiers will attend leader development schools in a temporary-duty status and return to their home station. If the soldier's unit deploys overseas, it will return to the same installation. Soldiers in some specialties may not be able to remain in one organization during their entire stabilization period because of unit structure and professional development needs. To avoid a permanentchange-of-station  move,  this  policy  directs  that  these  soldiers  will be reassigned on their current installation if vacancies exist at that post. The Army will continue to rotate soldiers to Korea for one-year tours. After completing their tour, soldiers will return to the same installation in the United States from which they had left for Korea, and where their family remained during their tour.

Unit-focused stabilization aligned soldier assignments and unit operational cycles. This policy will be implemented in conjunction with the Army's transition from a division-based force to a modular, brigade-based force. For most units, life-cycle management will align soldier  and  unit  operational  cycles  for  thirty-six  months.  Cyclical manning schedules all personnel transitions into a one- to two-month sustain  period,  followed  by  a  two-  to  three-month  build  period  in which the units are brought to full strength and prepare for the training phase. The training phase will begin at the individual and smallunit levels, followed by higher-echelon training and culminating with a validation exercise. After the training phase, units will spend the balance of their operational cycle, roughly twenty-eight months, in the ready phase. During this phase, they will rotate through the standard red/amber/green training cycles, travel to combat training centers, and deploy overseas, if required, for six- or twelve-month tours. To maximize readiness, the Army will have to stagger the training and ready phases of its U.S.-based brigade combat teams. The transition to unit-focused stabilization was expected to take three years.

The Army continued work begun in 1999 to revise officer and enlisted  military  occupational  specialty  classification  systems  to better align them with the needs of a post-Cold War force. This process will simplify the way the Army assigns soldiers and will improve readiness by consolidating specialties and cultivating the development of multiskilled soldiers. The objective is to have less than 200 MOSs

by 2008. Major changes during FY 2004 included merging fourteen ordnance MOSs into six and replacing sixteen separate specialties for musicians with a single MOS for Army bandperson, with each musician's instrument specialty noted by an additional skill identifier.

In 1985, the Engineer School began offering the Sapper Leader Course, but soldiers who completed the course did not receive any uniform  insignia  to  identify  them  as  graduates.  The  course  trains selected  combat  engineer  unit  leaders  in  leadership  skills,  combat engineer and infantry battle drills, and the specialized engineer and infantry  techniques  required  to  perform  as  members  of  a  combat engineer battalion. Engineers had argued for years that the course was sufficiently demanding that its graduates should be recognized with an insignia as were graduates of courses such as airborne, air assault,  and  ranger.  In  June  2004,  the  chief  of  staff  of  the  Army approved wear of the Sapper Tab for graduates of the Sapper Leader Course. The decision was retroactive, so all graduates of the course since it was established were authorized to wear the tab.

## Force Development, Training, and Operations

## Force Development

In September 2003, General Schoomaker directed that the Army begin converting to a modular, brigade-based force. The new concept would be based on units of action, brigade-sized fixed organizations with discrete sets of capabilities that nonetheless employed as many standardized systems as possible, and which could be plugged into any  organization  because  of  the  common  parts  they  shared.  This would increase the strategic  responsiveness  of  the  Army  by  giving the service a pool of readily adaptable forces to meet the demands of combatant commanders. Schoomaker's guidance included expanding the number of brigade combat teams in a division from three to five. Building more of these units would help to increase the time between overseas deployments and thus lessen the strain on the Army of what now promised to be lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The chief  of  staff  directed  the  Training  and  Doctrine  Command (TRADOC) to organize the 3d Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) into prototype modular organizations. The design and decision process for modularity was to be quick. The deadline for delivery of the new heavy and infantry brigade combat team organizations was set for January 2004; those for support brigades and echelons above the brigade came later in the year. The reorganization of the two divisions was also to occur during 2004 so that those units would be fully redesigned when they deployed to Iraq in 2005.

To develop the new modular organization, TRADOC established Task Force Modularity. The task force in February 2004 presented a briefing to Schoomaker on designs for the modular heavy and infantry units of action. It had found that available resources would permit the service to field only one new brigade combat team per division, and to do even that, the new design had to have only two, instead of the standard three, maneuver battalions. To compensate for the missing battalion, the new designs featured technological and organizational expedients that the task force termed 'enablers.' On the

technological  level,  these  included  reliance  on  the  'Good  Enough Battle Command' system (which consisted of those parts of the Army Battle Command System that could be fielded to all of the Army's units),  counterbattery  radar,  various  threat-detecting  sensors,  and unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles. Each unit of action would have a reconnaissance squadron. A brigade troops battalion would provide command, security, and support for the headquarters, separate companies, and any attachments. General Schoomaker approved the designs for use in converting the 3d Infantry and the 101st Airborne Divisions, including activating a fourth brigade combat team in  each  division.  The  10th  Mountain Division began converting to the infantry unit of action organization during the final month of FY 2004,  with  the  exception  of  its  2d  Brigade,  which  had  deployed  to Iraq, and it activated a fourth brigade combat team.

In July 2004, HQDA announced its brigade combat team force structure  plans  for  FYs  2005  and  2006.  Locations  for  the  brigade combat teams were selected based on existing installation capacities, available training space, and current locations of similar units. In FY 2005, new modular brigade combat teams will be activated at Fort Polk,  Louisiana;  Fort  Richardson,  Alaska;  and  Fort  Hood,  Texas. The 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, having returned from Iraq, will convert into a Stryker brigade stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. Initially, the regiment was to have retained its cavalry mission with a modified organization that featured more reconnaissance and mobile gun system vehicles than other Stryker brigades. The need for more infantry units to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, prompted the decision to configure the unit as a standard infantry  Stryker  brigade  while  retaining  its  cavalry  designation.  In  FY 2006, new modular brigade combat teams will be activated at Fort Benning,  Georgia;  Fort  Bliss,  Texas;  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina; and Fort Riley, Kansas. The locations of these brigades, however, may change because of decisions made in 2005 during the next Base Realignment and Closure analysis.

By September 2004, Task Force Modularity had developed and General Schoomaker had approved initial designs for the five support units of action (fires, sustainment, aviation, maneuver enhancement,  and  battlefield  surveillance)  and  for  higher-echelon  organizations known as units of employment. At the end of FY 2004, however, not all aspects of these designs had been finalized, especially  those  concerning  the  battlefield  surveillance  unit  of  action and the units of employment. The designations that would be used for units of action and units of employment were also not yet finalized. In September 2004, the U.S. Army Center of Military History

Stryker vehicles in Iraq



briefed General Schoomaker on various options, but he delayed a decision until after a blue ribbon panel, headed by former Chief of Staff Gordon R. Sullivan, had examined the issue. The panel was expected to make its recommendations in January 2005.

In May 2000, the Army began the reorganization of the 3d Brigade,  2d  Infantry  Division,  as  the  service's  first  Stryker  brigade combat team. These brigade combat teams use the Stryker family of medium-armored vehicles and bridge the gap between easily deployable light units and heavy armored units that, while more survivable and lethal  than  their  light  counterparts,  require  significantly  more time and resources to deploy. Early in FY 2004, the first Stryker brigade deployed to Iraq, where it replaced units of the 101st Airborne Division in northern Iraq and formed the core of Task Force olympIa .  Senior  American  commanders  soon  came  to  value  highly  the mobility, protection, digital capabilities, and logistical flexibility of Stryker units, calling on the brigade to take the fight to the enemy, not only in northwestern Iraq but also elsewhere in the country. The brigade returned to its home station at Fort Lewis in October 2004.

The secretary of defense, in a July 2003 memorandum, directed the services to take steps to reduce the need for involuntary mobilization during the early stages of a rapid-response operation, using the initial fifteen days as the planning metric, and to limit involuntary mobilization to reasonable and sustainable rates, using not more than one year in every six as the planning metric. In response, the

Army conducted an analysis of various rapid-response scenarios and identified  areas  in  which  rebalancing  and  innovative  management were needed. As a result of this analysis, the service plans to convert 5,600 spaces of lower-priority active structure to higher-priority active structure. These conversions will add capabilities in chemical, military  police,  engineer  (bridging  and  firefighting  units),  medical, quartermaster (fuel, water, and mortuary affairs units), and transportation specialties. The conversion will take place over several years, beginning with 800 spaces in FY 2004 and continuing into FY 2009.

The experience of fighting insurgents in Iraq and operations against terrorists elsewhere in the world prompted a new look at Army doctrine on this subject. In February 2004, Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace, the commanding general of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, directed the center's doctrine directorate to begin preparing an interim field  manual  on  counterinsurgency  operations.  The  directorate  will collaborate with officials from the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center, the U.S. Marine Corps' Combat Development Command, and the British Army. The interim manual was expected to be ready in October 2004 for distribution within the Army.

In response to the increasing use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by enemy forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army G-3 created the Army IED Task Force in October 2003. Its mission was to assist in coordinating and synchronizing the wide variety of ongoing efforts to mitigate the threat of IEDs. The task force reached out to several organizations across the Army and the Department of Defense, working to get the best solutions in place. The task force and its partners achieved some success, and this success, together with the need for a coordinated effort across the Department of Defense, led the department to  establish  in  July  2004  an  Army-led  Joint  IED  Defeat  Integrated Process Team. Organized around the existing Army IED Task Force, the new organization assumed the mission of bringing together all counter-IED efforts within the Department of Defense.

## Training

After  nearly  two  years  of  work,  the  service  in  October  2003 published the Army Digital Training Strategy . The objective of the strategy is to expand digital expertise in recognition of the current importance of computer-based systems and that they will become integral  to  operations  in  the  future  once  the  Army  transitions  to fully digitized battle command. Current digital training policies are based on Cold War-era systems and methods and these cannot support the new digital technologies being fielded or planned for the

future force. Development of the strategy included lessons learned from fielding the Army's first digitized division at Fort Hood and the first Stryker brigade at Fort Lewis.

The strategy established four phases for creating a fully  digitized battle command with current and future systems. The first is to establish a basic capability to use a system. The second is to improve the capability to use a system, including integrating it with other systems, to standard in all conditions. The third is to sustain these skills, both through unit training and soldier self-study. The fourth acknowledges that digital technologies often experience rapid, leapahead changes, and that the service must prepare soldiers and units to accommodate expected and unexpected changes in a system so that they can quickly reestablish operational capability.

Implementation of the strategy will be based on a plan prepared by TRADOC, with the assistance of G-3, HQDA. Digital technologies  often  experience  rapid  changes.  Therefore,  TRADOC,  with the support of G-3, HQDA, will update the implementation plan at the beginning of each program objective memorandum (POM) formulation period. The digital training strategy will be reviewed and revised by G-3, HQDA, and TRADOC as often as necessary, but no later than annually from the effective date of the strategy.

To  provide  strategic  direction  and  guidance  for  transforming and standardizing training and leader development processes, the commanding general of TRADOC in September 2004 was designated  as  the  Army  Training  Enterprise  Integrator.  The  responsibilities of this position include creating a training enterprise integration  process  within  the  Training  and  Leader  General  Officer Steering Committee. The committee will be the main governance body to provide strategic direction and guidance for transforming and standardizing Army training and leader-development business processes.  Additional  training  and  leader-development  enterprise integration forums will be established, as necessary, to ensure that requirements, resources, and priorities are integrated and synchronized. At the same time, the commanding general of the Combined Arms  Center  was  designated  as  the  Specified  Proponent  for  the Battle Command Knowledge System and as the Deputy for Army Training Enterprise Integration. This commanding general will be responsible for integrating the Army training modernization initiatives and will work closely with the G-3 and the G-6 in HQDA.

The chief of staff of the Army directed TRADOC in January 2004 to review all initial entry training (IET) practices to ensure that soldiers were adequately prepared for the contemporary operating environment. There were several reasons for this directive. First, soldiers

were now deploying into combat zones within thirty to sixty days of completing IET. Second, input from combatant commanders and veterans of Operations endurIng Freedom and IraqI Freedom reported that many soldiers were not proficient in skills needed in these combat theaters, such as handling loaded weapons, urban and convoy operations, patrolling, checkpoint operations, field sanitation and hygiene, night operations, and combat lifesaver techniques. Also a concern was that soldiers had not been sufficiently prepared to meet the physical and emotional stresses of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The  Army  Accessions  Command  convened  a  task  force  for reviewing  and  revamping  IET,  with  a  focus  on  the  basic  combat training (BCT) program. An important resource for the task force was the Review of Education, Training, and Assignments for Leaders  study.  This  study  surveyed  commissioned  and  noncommissioned  leaders-both  combat  and  noncombat  veterans-from  all the Army's branches to discuss what they saw as the shortfalls of BCT and what they believed  were  the  most  critical  tasks  all  soldiers should be able to perform. From this survey and other sources, the task force developed a list of thirty-nine warrior tasks and nine battle drills  it  considered  essential  for  every  soldier,  regardless  of MOS, either to be familiar with or master. Only sixteen of the tasks and three of the drills were currently part of BCT and even fewer were being conducted in advanced individual training. Other recommended  changes  included  significantly  increasing  the  amount of field training time and making that training more stressful, and lengthening  BCT  from  nine  to  twelve  weeks.  The  chief  of  staff approved the inclusion of the warrior tasks, battle drills, and the revised field training, but he disapproved lengthening BCT because that would disrupt the flow of new soldiers required by existing units and new modular brigade combat teams.

Pilot BCT courses were conducted at Fort Benning, Fort Knox (Kentucky), and Fort Jackson (South Carolina), to develop methods for incorporating these changes. The revised BCT program that came out of these tests included extending the training day to ten hours, making Saturday a full training day, and using sergeants (pay grade E-5) as drill sergeants. This revised program was expected to be implemented during FY 2005.

To ensure that the warrior tasks and battle drills are correctly taught, TRADOC established the Combat Leaders Course at Fort Benning, a two-week train-the-trainers program for drill sergeants who are not infantrymen. During the course, these soldiers review basic  weapon  and  individual  skills  and  then  receive  training  on dismounted  and  mounted  operations  in  a  tactical  environment.

The instructors were all recently returned combat veterans. After two pilot programs were conducted, the course was approved for implementation during FY 2005. TRADOC expected to run twenty courses  during  that  year,  with  forty-four  students  in  each.  The Combat Leaders Course is  not  expected  to  become  a  permanent course. Training on these tasks and skills will be incorporated into the drill sergeant school and noncommissioned officer professional development courses,  and  as  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan continue,  more  support  and  service  support  soldiers  will  acquire combat experience.

Because  many  soldiers  were  deployed  to  combat  zones  soon after  completing  initial  entry  training,  the  Accessions  Command introduced a new physical fitness training program in April 2004. This program replaced the previous emphasis on push-ups, sit-ups, and a two-mile run with a variety of exercises that feature a wide range of motion and wind sprints. These drills were developed after an analysis  of  body  movement while performing soldier common tasks. Although the current physical fitness test would not change, the new program would still prepare soldiers for the test while at the same time better preparing them for service in a combat zone. The changes were also expected to decrease the number of injuries during initial entry training. Basic combat training, advanced individual training, ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) detachments, and basic officer leadership courses used the new program.

Among the programs initiated during the fiscal year to reach the active Army's new authorized strength was the Warrior Transition Course. This was a four-week course for two groups. The first group was for enlisted veterans from any of the military services who have enlisted in the Army. The second group was for sailors and airmen in grades E-2 to E-5 who have transferred to the Army under Operation Blue to Gold. Since all the trainees have already gone through a military basic training program, the Warrior Transition Course focused on skills and techniques essential in ground combat. The first course, conducted at Fort Knox, began in September 2004.

During  FY  2004,  TRADOC  prepared  major  changes  to  the noncommissioned officer education system that would be implemented  beginning  in  FY  2005.  The  impetus  for  these  changes was the  need  to  support  the  new  stabilization  policies,  to  assist in  the  service's  continuing  transformation  to  a  post-Cold  War force, and to incorporate lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan. Previously, soldiers were scheduled for professional development courses individually and their names placed on quarterly lists that notified them and their commanders of the schooling requirement.

To support stabilization, for the residence phase of the course the Human Resources Command now will review the life-cycle status of units and schedule soldiers based on when is the most advantageous time in the life cycle for soldiers to be away from the unit. Portions of some courses, particularly those that are not branchspecific,  will  be  taught  at  soldiers'  home  stations  using  distance learning  and  video  teletraining  methods.  Eliminating  the  common-core subjects from the residence phase permitted this phase to be shortened, decreasing the time soldiers are away from their units. This change also allowed schools to offer more classes each year, thereby helping to meet the demand for additional noncommissioned officers created by the transition to a modular force.

Under the select-train-promote system, soldiers had to be selected for promotion before they could attend the professional development course required for that rank. Now, in order to supply the number of noncommissioned officers needed for the increase in the active Army's strength and the new modular units, soldiers will be able to attend these courses before being selected for promotion to the corresponding rank. To quicken the incorporation of combat experience in these courses, the  Center  for  Army  Lessons  Learned  will  establish  an  element  to prepare  material  for  service  schools  within  twenty-four  hours  of receiving lessons from units in theater. The non-MOS-specific portions of these courses will now present more detailed instruction based on these lessons and emphasize the Warrior Ethos.

The Army closed the Combined Arms and Services Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in May 2004. The school was established in 1981 with the mission to teach the skills required of staff officers at the brigade level and above. Under a reorganization of the officer education system, the school was replaced by a five-day combined arms exercise in the captains career courses conducted at branch schools. The Regular Army transitioned to this new concept during FY 2004, but reserve component officers will continue to attend their version of combined arms and services staff school courses until reserve officer captains career courses are revised to include staff officer training.

Early in FY 2004, the Army established the Aircraft Shoot Down Assessment Team, a dedicated combat assessment and countertactics development organization at the Aviation School, in response to aircraft losses in Iraq and Afghanistan. The team's work made it clear that operations in these countries required sometimes drastically  different  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  from  those developed for use in Europe. These findings were incorporated into training at the school and in units.

## Deployed Operational Forces

The largest number of deployed Army forces in FY 2004 was committed to Operation IraqI Freedom . At the end of FY 2003, a total  of  152,815  soldiers  were  deployed  on  this  operation;  in  September 2004, Army strength in the operation was 101,932. During the  year,  Combined  Joint  Task  Force-7  (CJTF-7)  conducted  the first rotation of forces in that country as it transitioned from Operation IraqI Freedom I to Operation IraqI Freedom II. This rotation included  both  American  and  other  coalition  nations'  units,  and involved  moving  nearly  260,000  personnel  and  more  than  50,000 pieces of equipment into and out of Iraq. Major Army combat units departing the country were the 1st Armored, 4th Infantry, 82d Airborne, and 101st Airborne Divisions; the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment;  the  173d  Airborne  Brigade;  and  the  V  Corps  Artillery.  In February 2004, the III Corps staff replaced the V Corps staff as the core of the CJTF-7 headquarters. Major Army combat units arriving during the rotation were the 1st Infantry and 1st Cavalry Divisions, along with the 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division; 2d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division; 30th Infantry Brigade; 39th Infantry Brigade; 81st Armored Brigade; and

197th Field Artillery Brigade. To reinforce the II Marine Expeditionary Force, the 2d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, deployed from Korea to Iraq in August 2004.

The rotation was complicated by the uprising of Shi'ite militias in April 2004 that triggered the most intense combat since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The scale of enemy actions required CJTF-7 to suspend the redeployment of the 1st Armored Division and the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, which was attached to the division, for three months in order to have sufficient forces to defeat the uprising. The division had already begun to redeploy soldiers to home stations in  the  United  States  and  Germany  when  it  received  the  extension order and much of its equipment was in Kuwait awaiting shipment. Furthermore, CJTF-7 had ordered the division into a new area of operations to suppress the uprising. The division reassembled its personnel, theater logistical units reversed the flow of material, and the 1st Armored Division accomplished its new mission as CJTF-7's main effort against the uprising. Once the uprising had been suppressed, the 1st Armored Division and the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment left Iraq for their home stations.

In  Iraq  during  FY  2004,  a  total  of  428  soldiers  were  killed in action  or  died  of  wounds.  Another  109  soldiers  died  from non-combat-related causes. The wounded numbered 4,277 soldiers.

General Sanchez and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld



During FY 2004, U.S. Central Command  conducted  a  major reorganization of senior headquarters in Iraq. At the beginning of the year, CJTF-7 controlled all coalition operations. The task force, however, was essentially an augmented  corps  headquarters. Both the  task  force  commander, Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, and the  commander  of  U.S.  Central Command, General John P. Abizaid, concluded by the end of FY 2003  that  a  single  headquarters of  this  type  was  inadequate  for conducting  coalition  operations at  the  tactical,  operational,  and theater-strategic  levels  of  war  in a  complex  and  uncertain  political environment.  In  December 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  approved  Abizaid's

General Casey



request to create Headquarters, Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I). The mission of this new headquarters, commanded by a four-star general officer, is to provide theater-strategic and operational-level command and control for all coalition forces. The most important functions for it are to coordinate, synchronize, and deliver security, economic, diplomatic, and information operations with the U.S. Embassy and the new Iraqi government.

The commander of MNF-I reports to the commander of Central Command. In turn, MNF-I commands two, three-star headquarters: Multi-National  Corps-Iraq  (MNC-I),  which  controls  tactical-level military  operations,  and  Multi-National  Security  Transition  Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), which controls the programs for organizing, equipping, training, and advising the Iraqi security forces, as well as for rebuilding Iraq's Ministry of Defense and other military infrastructure. MNF-I also has opera  tional oversight of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Gulf Region Division, which is involved in the reconstruction of Iraq, and it is supported by the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula.

The separation of CJTF-7 into MNF-I and MNC-I occurred in April 2004, although the III Corps staff was not fully reassembled as the new MNC-I until July 2004. General Sanchez took command of

MNF-I, while the III Corps commander took command of MNC-I. In July, General George W. Casey Jr., who had been serving as the vice chief of staff of the Army, relieved General Sanchez as the commander of MNF-I. Multi-National Security Transition CommandIraq replaced the Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq in June 2004, although  it  then  took  several  months  for  the  new  organization  to develop its initial staffing requirements and to get them filled.

The second largest number of deployed Army forces in FY 2004 was committed to Afghanistan for Operation endurIng Freedom . In October 2003, about 11,000 soldiers were deployed there; in September 2004, Army strength in that country was approximately 13,500. By the fall of 2003, the campaign in Afghanistan had become a more complex effort that involved a combined joint task force that included a number of nations as well as various agencies of the U.S. government.  The  existing  combined  joint  task  force  based  on  a  division headquarters did not have the proper manning or expertise to direct the campaign at this level. Moreover, CJTF-180 was not well suited to direct theater-strategic affairs while also overseeing the military campaign at the tactical and operational levels. Therefore, in October 2003, a new senior military headquarters, Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan  (CFC-A),  commanded  by  Lt.  Gen.  David  W. Barno, was created to handle theater-strategic affairs so CJTF-180

could concentrate on the tactical and operational levels. Headquarters, Department of the Army, however, found it difficult to provide sufficient Regular Army officers with the training and skills needed to  staff  CFC-A.  In  addition  to  competing  internal  Army  requirements, the Office of the Secretary of Defense considered Afghanistan to be an economy of force operation. The main effort was in Iraq and therefore CJTF-7, and later MNF-I, had precedence for these officers over CFC-A. Many of the billets on the CFC-A staff were instead filled with officers mobilized from the Individual Ready Reserve.

In April 2004, the headquarters of the 25th Infantry Division relieved the 10th Mountain Division headquarters as the command element for CJTF-180. The CFC-A used this change to redesignate the combined joint task force as CJTF-76 because the '180' designation had traditionally been given to joint task forces led by the U.S. Army XVIII Airborne Corps, the first unit to command the combined  joint  task  force  in  Afghanistan.  The  designation  '76' was  chosen  to  evoke  America's  history  and  the  democratic  spirit of 1776 in the hope that it would highlight the change in command at the operational level at a time when Afghanistan appeared to be moving closer to democracy. By the end of FY 2004, major U.S. Army units in CJTF-76 included a brigade headquarters, a division artillery headquarters, five infantry battalions, a cavalry squadron, a  field  artillery  battalion,  three  engineer  battalions,  and  an  aviation brigade. The Combined Joint Special Operations Task ForceAfghanistan had a staff built around the headquarters of the 3d Special Forces Group. Special Forces, Ranger, and Special Operations Aviation units served in this task force alongside special operations forces from other military services and other coalition nations, and Afghan forces.

Until early 2004, CJTF-180 forces had emphasized major military operations. Typically, these efforts involved a series of assaults conducted by heliborne company- or battalion-sized units against small bands of insurgents, who invariably suffered defeat if they resisted. These operations inflicted heavy casualties on insurgents and resulted in the discovery of hundreds of caches of weapons and ammunition. These operations did not prevent enemy attacks from increasing in frequency and violence during 2003. Particularly worrisome was that these attacks targeted Afghan civilians, Afghan security forces, and representatives  of  international  organizations  and  nongovernmental organizations. In the autumn of 2003, CFC-A responded to this development by shifting the approach in Afghanistan to counterinsurgency, thereby emphasizing that the Afghan people were now the decisive strategic focus for coalition forces.

A crucial piece of the counterinsurgency effort was enlarging and improving Afghan security forces. In the spring of 2003, the Office  of  Military  Cooperation-Afghanistan  had  created  a  new task  force  to  serve  as  the  central  core  of  trainers  for  the  Afghan National Army. The new organization had been named Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) phoenIx to signify the rebirth of Afghanistan's professional army. The 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, became the core of CJTF phoenIx , with its soldiers organized into mobile  training  teams  and  embedded  training  teams.  In  November 2003, the 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, was replaced in CJTF phoenIx by the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, the first brigade-sized reserve component force to serve in Afghanistan.

In  mid-2003,  when  the  45th  Infantry  Brigade  had  received  the mission to serve as the core of CJTF phoenIx , brigade leaders realized they had a major challenge in manning the embedded training teams because these elements required soldiers who were relatively high in rank to ensure that the teams had personnel with sufficient skills and experience. The brigade's table of organization did not provide enough officers and senior noncommissioned officers to fill all the teams. The National Guard Bureau arranged for soldiers from the Vermont Army National Guard and the South Carolina Army National Guard, as well as personnel from the Marine Corps, to fill the positions on the team that the brigade could not man. The 76th Infantry  Brigade  of  the  Indiana  Army  National  Guard  in  August 2004 relieved the 45th Infantry Brigade as the core of CJTF phoenIx . As with the Oklahoma brigade, the 76th Infantry Brigade required additional Guard personnel from other states, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force in order to fill all the required training teams.

Seventeen soldiers in Operation endurIng Freedom were killed in action or died of wounds during FY 2004. Another 21 soldiers died  from  non-combat-related  causes.  There  were  171  soldiers wounded in action.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Change

In  October  2003,  the  100th  Missile  Defense  Brigade  (GroundBased  Midcourse  Defense)  was  activated  at  Peterson  Air  Force Base, Colorado, as a subordinate command of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command. The brigade's mission was to provide  command and control of ground-based midcourse antimissile operations. The brigade was staffed largely by active Colorado Army National Guard personnel, along with a small contingent of Regular Army soldiers. In January 2004, the 49th Missile Defense Battalion (Ground-Based  Midcourse  Defense)  was  activated  at  Fort  Greely, Alaska. The battalion was assigned to the 100th Missile Defense Brigade and was completely staffed by members of the Alaska National Guard. The battalion's mission was the operation, maintenance, and security of the interceptor missiles. By the end of FY 2004, five interceptor missiles had been emplaced at Fort Greely.

The Army Reserve during FY 2004 continued work on the Federal Reserve Restructuring Initiative. This initiative-which began in 2003 and is planned to be completed in 2006-is synchronized with the Army Transformation Campaign Plan and will produce a force that is fully manned, equipped, and resourced; a force that is flexible and adaptable to change; and a force of ready units available for worldwide deployment. The initiative listed six imperatives. The first will revise the method for mobilizing units. The second will streamline the higher headquarters echelons and have the new command structure focus most of its attention on the training, readiness, and mobilization of units. The third will revise the mix of unit types to provide the capabilities required in current and future operations. The fourth will improve the management of human resources, both in administrative matters and by recognizing that soldiers' level of military participation varies over time because of changing family, occupational, and personal growth requirements. The fifth will build a rotational capability that allows for the repeated and sustained mobilization of high-demand units. The sixth will establish a capability-based pool of individual soldiers across

a range of specialties readily available for mobilization and deployment as augmentees in active and reserve component units.

## Personnel Management

In FY 2004, a total of 129,985 enlisted personnel (42.5 percent of total) in the Army National Guard had at least two years of active duty  before  becoming  a  member  of  the  Guard.  In  Army  Reserve troop  units,  36,396  enlisted  personnel  (21.64  percent  of  total)  had served at least two years on active duty before joining a unit. Among Army National Guard officers, there were 20,653 (56.3 percent) who had served at least two years on active duty, while 9,828 (25.47 percent) of officers in Army Reserve units had done so.

Early in FY 2004, the Army revised its policy on the promotion of reserve component officers in response to difficulties created by the large number of officers being mobilized. The Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act requires that when promoting officers to the ranks of captain through colonel in the Selected Reserve, these officers must either be assigned to a permanent reserve component position requiring the new rank or be transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve. This requirement limited the ability to promote mobilized officers because they are generally tied to the position in which they were serving when ordered to active duty. The revised policy permitted officers, involuntarily mobilized either as individuals or with a unit, to be promoted and serve in a higher rank while on active duty. These officers, however, within 180 days of demobilization must either be assigned to a position requiring the new rank or be transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve. The revised policy did not cover officers in the Chaplain, Judge Advocate, Medical, and Dental Corps, as Army regulations already permit them to be promoted without a vacant unit position in the higher rank.

As part of the Federal Reserve Restructuring Initiative, the Army Reserve will restructure its personnel end strength, divesting 35,000 spaces by inactivating units that are less relevant to the current operational environment, are habitually unready, or are too costly to modernize. Approximately 20,000 of these spaces will be used to establish a trainee, transient, holdee, and student (TTHS) personnel account, and about 2,000 of the spaces will be used for the Individual Augmentee Program. The remaining spaces will be used to bring units to their full required manning levels, thereby increasing readiness.

The TTHS account will increase unit readiness by removing nondeployable  soldiers  from  troop  unit  spaces.  Currently,  nondeployable soldiers are carried on the rolls for a variety of reasons, thereby

lowering the readiness of units. The 81st Regional Readiness Command began testing a prototype regional account in October 2003 by establishing a TTHS management division within its G-1 personnel readiness division and completing TTHS account transfers. After an analysis of the test program, the Army Reserve-wide version will be implemented in FY 2005.

The Individual Augmentee Program is designed to solve a readiness problem created by the growing number of instances in which a Regular or Reserve unit preparing to deploy needs just one or several people in high-demand specialties to reach full strength. Currently, the required personnel are levied from a Reserve unit, thereby negatively affecting the readiness of that unit. The establishment of the augmentee program will provide a group of soldiers in high-demand specialties  who  are  trained  and  ready  to  go  when  needed  without affecting unit readiness. Soldiers who volunteer for this program will train  with  a  Reserve  unit  but  will  not  be  assigned  to  a  position  in that unit. The mix of military occupational specialties for the program will be based on a review of which ones are in most demand as augmentees. To manage the program, the U.S. Army Reserve Command established in October 2003 a provisional augmentation unit to which augmentee volunteers will be assigned. The first volunteers are expected to be assigned to this unit in early FY 2005.

The  Army  National  Guard  continued  to  provide  family  assistance  to  all  military  dependents  in  geographically  dispersed  areas beyond the support capability of military facilities. As the Army's lead agency for the establishment and execution of family assistance, the  Army  National  Guard  operated,  on  average,  400  centers  each month during FY 2004. Family assistance centers are the primary entry point for all services and assistance that any military family member may need during the service member's deployment, regardless of the service member's component. These centers are also critical  to  demobilizing service members and the long-term health and welfare of military families. The estimated requirement for centers in FY 2005 is 425.

About  5,000  active  component  personnel  were  authorized  for Title XI positions that support the reserve components. At the end of  FY  2004,  a  total  of  4,756  officers  and  enlisted  personnel  were assigned to these positions. Most of these soldiers are officers and noncommissioned  officers  assigned  to  training  support  brigades. When Congress created this requirement after the Persian Gulf War, it did not provide the Regular Army with a corresponding increase in its authorized end strength. This disparity became a problem during FY 2004 with the need to fully man active component units deployed

for combat operations and the decision to activate ten new Regular brigade combat teams in the modular force structure reorganization. The chief of staff of the Army decided to give a higher priority to Regular units and therefore limited the number of active component personnel in Title XI positions to 90 percent of authorized strength during FY 2005.

## Recruiting and Retention

The Army National Guard's recruiting objective for the fiscal year was 56,002; it fell short by 13 percent, accessioning 48,793 new enlisted personnel. To compensate for this shortfall, the FY 2005 accessions objective was increased from 56,000 to 63,000. The main reason for the shortfall in FY 2004 was a drop in accessioning prior-service personnel. This drop had two causes: the use of stop-loss in the active component and the increasing number of Guard units being mobilized-many active component veterans did not wish to risk deploying  with  a  Guard  unit  so  soon  after  returning  from  a  deployment with a Regular unit. The non-prior-service recruiting effort fell short in two quality indicators. The objective was that 90 percent of these recruits would be high school graduates and that 60 percent would score in Categories I to IIIA on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Among non-prior-service recruits, 84 percent were high school graduates and 57 percent scored in desired categories.

Reenlistment in the Army National Guard also fell short during FY 2004, although by a smaller margin than in recruiting. Among soldiers with less than nine years of service, the reenlistment objective was 12,978; a total of 12,834 soldiers in this category did reenlist. Among soldiers with more than nine years of service, the reenlistment objective was 34,522; a total of 34,178 soldiers in this category reenlisted.

The Army National Guard took several actions in response to recruiting  and  retention  difficulties  identified  during  the  year.  It launched a new marketing campaign, 'American Soldier,' targeting non-prior-service  candidates.  This  campaign  reached  prospective recruits through radio, television, college marketing, Internet media, event marketing and point-of-sale materials, promotional items, print media, and mass mailings. Six new and twenty-four updated presentations were prepared for the 'YOU CAN' secondary school recruiting program. More soldiers were assigned to recruiting and retention duties,  and  a  comprehensive  recruiting  and  retention  noncommissioned  officer  sustainment  training  program  using  mobile  training teams was introduced.

The Army Reserve recruiting objective in FY 2004 was 32,275. Among the  non-prior-service  recruits,  90  percent  were  to  be  high school graduates and 60 percent were to have scored in Categories I to IIIA on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. This component exceeded all these goals, recruiting 32,699 new soldiers, 91 percent of whom were high school graduates and 70 percent of whom scored in the desired categories.

Early in FY 2004, retention in the Army Reserve lagged behind the  milestone  objectives  set  for  the  year.  Causes  for  this  shortfall included the involuntary tour extension of some reservists deployed in Iraq, reenlistment bonuses that are less than those offered to the active component, and the requirement that reservists may reenlist only within three months of their term of service ending. The Office of the Chief of Army Reserve established a retention task force to develop a retention strategy. The close attention given to retention issues ensured that the Army Reserve met its attrition goal for FY 2004. Still pending at the end of the fiscal year were requests to Congress to increase reenlistment bonuses for reservists.

## Training and Readiness

The  incorporation  of  training  aids,  devices,  simulators,  and simulations as an integral part of Army National Guard training continued  during  FY  2004.  The  Advanced  Bradley  Full-Crew Interactive  Simulation  Trainer  was  fielded,  providing  full  crew precision gunnery for the M2 and M3 family of vehicles. Updated Simulations  Network  (SIMNET)  virtual  maneuver  simulators for  the  M1A1  and  M2A2  vehicles  supported  maneuver  training in  the  Army  National  Guard.  The  SIMNET  modules  feature a  new  personal  computer-based  visual  system,  host  computer, and  sound  system.  The  Army's  latest  approved  Janus  software versions updated the Army National Guard Battle Staff Trainers. The  updated  Janus  software operates on portable personal computers, and the Guard continued to procure new hardware to ensure that these systems could operate the Objective One SemiAutomated Forces software when it is fielded in FY 2007. Fielding of  the  Engagement  Skills  Trainer  2000  continued  in  FY  2004. This device is the Army's collective marksmanship training device and is used by the Guard to provide unit collective gunnery and tactical training. During FY 2004, there was a large increase in the number of Guard personnel mobilized, and the National Guard Bureau procured additional training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations sets for mobilization sites at Camp Shelby (Mississippi)

and at Fort Bliss, Fort Hood, and Fort Drum (New York). One of the  most  important  sets  fielded  during  the  year  was  the  Virtual Combat Convoy Training system.

The Army Reserve also used simulation devices like the Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 and the Virtual Combat Convoy Training system at consolidated training sites, including mobilization stations. The Army Reserve continued to work with the U.S. Army Infantry School and the Army Training Support Command to incorporate the Laser Marksmanship Training System into a training strategy that supports initial entry and unit sustainment training. In 2004, Army Reserve efforts with the maker of the laser training system resulted in  the  development  of  full-scale  laser  targets  that  support  convoy counterambush training.  These  targets  permitted  the  use  of  roads and buildings for greater realism in tactical marksmanship training, and units were allowed to conduct this training at home station.

Mobilizations for Operation IraqI Freedom preempted most of the planned rotations for Guard units at the combat training centers during the year. The planned brigade rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, was replaced by rotations for the 30th and 39th Brigade Combat Teams. A mobilized infantry battalion also conducted a rotation at the center. The planned Guard unit rotations at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California, were replaced by the 81st and 256th Brigade Combat Teams. The Army  National  Guard  Battle  Command  Training  Center  at  Fort Leavenworth supported the 28th Infantry Division during its Battle Command Training Program rotation, while the 42d Infantry Division conducted a mission rehearsal exercise at the center in preparation for its deployment to Iraq. Six training program seminars for brigade command and battle staff were conducted at various locations in the United States.

The Army National Guard provided 549,868 man-days in fortyeight states and two territories to assist civil authorities in emergency support missions. The most notable were Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, Jeanne, and Isabel. The continuing western drought kept wildfires an almost year-round challenge with action especially concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of FY 2004. Flooding, especially in states east of the Mississippi River, also generated significant requests for Guard support.

In  the  Army  National  Guard,  30  officers  and  10,285  enlisted personnel were discharged for failure to complete their initial entry training within twenty-four months of joining. The number of Army Reserve soldiers likewise discharged during FY 2004 was 109 officers and 415 enlisted personnel.

## Mobilization

Over  the  course  of  FY  2004,  the  Army  National  Guard  averaged about 81,000 personnel mobilized at any one time. A total of approximately  149,790  soldiers  from  the  Army  National  Guard served on active duty during the year. More than half of the soldiers mobilized were in infantry, engineer, field artillery, or armor units. Approximately 71 percent of the Army National Guard's mobilizations during FY 2004 were deployed in support of Operations IraqI Freedom and endurIng  Freedom .  During  the  year,  94,851  Army National Guard soldiers served in support of Operation IraqI Freedom .  Among the units deployed to Iraq during the year were three brigade combat teams. In the third and fourth quarters of FY 2004, the Army National Guard mobilized other units, including six more brigade  combat  teams,  which  after  completing  postmobilization training will deploy to Iraq in early FY 2005. The headquarters of the 42d Infantry Division mobilized for Operation IraqI Freedom III; it will deploy in FY 2005 and assume command of one of the multinational divisions in Iraq. In addition to the brigades mobilized for Iraq, the 45th Brigade Combat Team completed its Afghan National Army training mission during FY 2004 and was replaced by the 76th Brigade Combat Team.

During  FY  2004,  the  Army  National  Guard  also  supported other combatant commands. The primary mission for the approximately 31,900  mobilized  Guard  personnel  serving  in  the  continental United States was providing security at U.S. Air Force bases and other critical sites under the U.S. Northern Command. Some 10,700 mobilized Guard personnel served in the U.S. European Command. Almost all of these soldiers served in Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Sinai. The Army National Guard deployed 2,569 soldiers to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. The majority assisted in the U.S.  Southern  Command's  support  and  engagement  relationships. In the U.S. Pacific Command area, the Army National Guard provided 3,170 soldiers for a variety of operations, including several Joint Chiefs of Staff-sponsored exercises.

The Army National Guard's 19th and 20th Special Forces Groups are  the  only  reserve  component  Special  Forces  units.  Both  groups deployed units to Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite wartime mobilizations and an overall increased operational tempo, both groups were able to conduct training with other nations' militaries and provide support to other units performing various missions in FY 2004.

By the end of FY 2003, the high demand for military police since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks had exceeded the available supply.

To address the resulting shortfall, the Army National Guard in November 2003 began mobilizing other types of units to use temporarily as military police. The mobilized units filled one of two functions. About 2,200 soldiers, mostly in field artillery batteries, will deploy as provisional military police companies to provide security at installations in the United States and Germany. Another 2,000 soldiers, mostly from field artillery and air defense artillery units, will deploy to Iraq as in-lieu-of military police companies; their primary mission will be convoy security. Postmobilization  training  for  the  provisional  military  police  focused  on law enforcement tasks, while that for in-lieu-of military police focused on  route  reconnaissance,  convoy  security,  and  crew-served  weapons. Almost all units are expected to revert to their original specialty following the end of their active-duty tour.

Operation guardIan marIner concluded in FY 2004. This operation involved the deployment of twelve-person teams to provide security for the Navy Military Sealift Command's strategic sealift ships traveling to and from the Persian Gulf area. The teams were drawn from the 92d Infantry Brigade (Separate) of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard starting in March 2003. Before deploying, each team underwent a twenty-one day course, with Army instructors focusing on weapons training, while Marine Corps instructors provided training on shipboard security. In June 2004, the U.S. Navy assumed responsibility for this mission under Operation vIgIlanT marIner .

Starting in May 2004 the Army Reserve, through its recruiters, began contacting Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) soldiers who had not yet fulfilled their mandatory service obligation to solicit their voluntary transfer from the IRR to an Army Reserve unit that had a vacancy they were qualified to fill. Some recruiters, however, informed IRR soldiers that they either had to join the unit with the vacancy or had to face being involuntarily recalled to active duty for service with a reserve component unit preparing for overseas deployment. Within a month, these actions had attracted substantial congressional and media attention. The Army Reserve Command blamed the actions on poorly worded guidance provided to recruiters. It instituted a procedure by which soldiers who believed they were unduly pressured into transferring to a unit, or that facts were misrepresented in the process of such a transfer action, could seek redress. Transfer orders determined to be the result of coercion or misrepresentation would be revoked.

On 30  June  2004,  the  Army  announced  plans  to  involuntarily order 5,600 soldiers of the IRR to active duty to fill personnel shortfalls  in  Regular,  Guard,  and  Reserve  units  slated  to  deploy  in  the Operation IraqI Freedom III and the Operation endurIng Freedom

vI rotations,  or  which  were  supporting  Operation noble  eagle . These personnel would have staggered reporting dates, ranging from late  August  to  late  October.  While  the  actual  requirement  was  for 4,400 soldiers, about 5,600 were mobilized because some IRR soldiers either would not report or would be found to be nondeployable. The five most-needed specialties were truck drivers, automated logistical specialists,  light-wheeled  vehicle  mechanics,  personnel  administration specialists, and combat engineers. Most of the recalled soldiers received report dates in early FY 2005. By the end of the fiscal year, a total of 1,143 soldiers had reported and begun receiving refresher training in common tasks and their military occupational specialty. Another 622 soldiers with report dates before the end of FY 2004 had not reported. By the end of FY 2004, a total of 1,374 recalled soldiers had requested either an exemption or a delay. Of these, 985 had their request still pending a decision, 373 requests had been approved, and 16 requests had been disapproved.

In the autumn of 2003, Lt. Gen. James R. Helmly, Chief, Army Reserve, concluded that Operation IraqI Freedom would be a longterm obligation requiring large numbers of American troops. A key part of the counterinsurgency campaign would be creating new Iraqi security forces, but the active component was too small to fully staff the  necessary  organizations  for  this  mission.  Therefore,  Helmly developed the Foreign Army-Training Assistance Command concept in  order to use Reserve training divisions to assist in this mission. He envisioned a standing headquarters commanded by a major general, either Regular Army or Reserve, which possessed a robust staff consisting of regulars and reservists. This headquarters would deploy to coordinate the planning for and execution of the rebuilding of a nation's armed forces. The training itself would be conducted by elements drawn from Reserve training divisions.

The  Army  G-3  approved  the  concept  in  April  2004,  although with one major change. Manpower spaces were not available to stand up a new command of this size, so the headquarters for the Foreign Army-Training  Assistance  Command  would  now  be  provided  by the  headquarters  of  an  institutional  training  division  of  the  Army Reserve. The next month, the concept was briefed to the commander of the soon-to-be activated Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, who decided that an Army Reserve team should deploy to Iraq to determine the exact requirements for this mission. The 98th Division (Institutional Training) was tasked to conduct this survey and alerted that it would provide whatever forces were determined to be necessary. Use of training divisions in this manner was a departure from existing doctrine, as these organizations were intended to

staff the training base in the United States during a major war, not to deploy overseas as unit trainers and combat advisers. This new use of training divisions encountered opposition from some regulars who believed that they were not capable of carrying out the mission, and some reservists who had never expected that serving in such a unit would include deployment to a combat zone.

The survey team found that the Foreign Army-Training Assistance Command concept was not needed since MNSTC-I now functioned in that role. Instead, individuals were needed to fill the many vacancies  in  MNSTC-I's headquarters and soldiers to serve on the advisory support teams, which would be assigned to Iraqi units. The team concluded that about 730 soldiers were needed and that about 310 of these were to be assigned to advisory support teams. In August 2004, HQDA approved this recommendation and the 98th Division began selecting which of its approximately 3,000 soldiers would deploy. The next month, HQDA issued the order to mobilize the selected personnel, who were to receive training for their assignments at Fort Bliss or Camp Atterbury, Indiana. The first four increments of soldiers had reported for this training by the end of the fiscal year; the remaining four increments would begin their training in October 2004.

During FY 2004, Army National Guard officers in state status for the first time (operating under Title 32 authority, that is, not in federal service) commanded joint task forces of Regular and Guard personnel assembled for specific national security events. These events were the G8 summit in Georgia, the Democratic National Convention in Massachusetts, and the Republican National Convention in New York. In Georgia, over 4,000 Guard personnel participated, while over 1,500 Guard personnel were used during each political convention.

In FY 2004, work continued on the Army Reserve Expeditionary Force concept. In August 2003, the Army Reserve began to implement this concept, which will complement the expeditionary concept being implemented in the active component. The expeditionary force concept will allow the Army Reserve to sustain its support of campaigns for a long, if not indefinite, period by cycling its limited, though renewable, assets and resources through a synchronized, progressive, and focused schedule  of  deployments,  engagements,  and  regeneration,  refit,  and retraining to achieve serial, selective readiness. The objective is to have units capable of deploying to the theater of operations for nine months on 120 hours' notice every five years. These units will be organized into Army Expeditionary Force Packages. Force packages will contain a mix of support and service elements synchronized in the same progressive readiness cycle. The first two expeditionary packages are expected to be ready for deployment in the autumn of 2005.

A  Defense  Manpower  Data  Center  survey  of  reserve  component personnel in mid-FY 2004 suggested that the large number of soldiers mobilized since March 2003 for Operations IraqI Freedom and endurIng Freedom had negatively affected morale in the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. The survey found a significant decline from May 2003 in the likelihood that personnel would remain in the service until retirement. Also declining noticeably were the family members' and civilian employers' favorable view of participation in the reserve components. A marked increase was noted in the number of soldiers reporting a more than usual level of stress in their military life. In the Army Reserve, a significant decline was seen in the number of soldiers who felt that they and their units were well prepared for deployment into a combat zone.

The  Army  during  FY  2003  was  ill-prepared  to  deal  with  the number of mobilized reserve component soldiers who were placed on medical holdover status. Medical holdover refers to soldiers retained on active duty for medical evaluation, treatment, and disposition, including definitive health care for medical conditions identified, incurred, or aggravated while on active duty. In October 2003, the United Press International reported that more than 1,000 reserve component soldiers at Fort Stewart (Georgia) and Fort Knox, including veterans of service in Iraq, were waiting weeks and sometimes months in medical holdover to have their medical conditions evaluated and to complete medical evaluation board processes. At Fort Stewart, many of the soldiers were billeted in concrete barracks built for reserve components to use during their annual training; because of this intended use, the barracks did not have air-conditioning or running water. Some soldiers complained they were being treated like 'second-class citizens' compared with active-duty soldiers, and vowed to leave the Army at the expiration of their obligated military service.

In November 2003, the vice chief of staff of the Army directed the Installation Management Agency (IMA) to provide adequate quarters for reserve component soldiers in medical holdover status. The agency spent $15.7 million to upgrade and repair facilities to ensure that these soldiers were housed in accordance with the acting secretary of the Army's standards: no more than four soldiers to a room, internal latrines, climate control, and some degree of privacy. When necessary, IMA contracted for accommodations in hotels or apartments when adequate housing was not available on a given post. In this matter, the agency coordinated with the Office of the Surgeon General, Forces Command, and First and Fifth Armies.

The assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs  assumed  oversight  of  all  medical  holdover  operations  and

established a multidisciplinary team of medical, personnel, and logistics experts to determine the magnitude of the problem and to recommend solutions. Forces Command was made the executive agent for  medical  holdover  operations,  and  IMA  assumed  responsibility for  command  and  control  of  medical  holdover  organizations.  The assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs in conjunction with the Army G-1 developed a policy that allowed the release of mobilized soldiers if they are medically unable to deploy after the first twenty-five days of active duty because of a preexisting medical condition. This policy was implemented because many of the soldiers placed in medical holdover during FY 2003 had reported for mobilization with a preexisting condition that prevented deployment. The Surgeon General mandated enhanced access standards for medical holdover patients, and he directed that all medical evaluation boards expedite their processes in treating these soldiers.

A long-term response to this problem was the creation of the Medical Retention Processing program in May 2004 and the CommunityBased Health Care Initiative in March 2004. Reserve component soldiers could be placed in the Medical Retention Processing program if they either could not return to duty within 60 days from the time of injury or becoming ill, or could not return to duty within 60 days but had less than 121 days beyond the return to duty date remaining on their mobilization orders. The soldier could request retention on active duty through the program and, once the request was approved by the Human Resources Command, the soldier was attached to a Medical Retention Processing Unit. These units consisted of a unit commander, an executive officer, platoon sergeants, and supply and other administrative support staff. The soldier-patients were assigned a case manager at a medical treatment facility who was responsible for  helping  them  schedule  medical  appointments  and  understand what steps they needed to take to progress through the treatment or evaluation process-to include applying for new Medical Retention Processing orders if necessary.

The  Community-Based  Health  Care  Initiative  allowed  reserve component  soldiers  on  Medical  Retention  Processing  orders  to return home and receive medical care through a civilian health care provider. During FY 2004, five pilot community-based health care organizations  were  established,  covering  twenty-three  states.  Each organization  was  staffed  between  thirty  and  thirty-five  personnel, primarily mobilized guardsmen. About half of these personnel provided administrative control of soldiers, while the rest handled case management and medical processing. Each had the capacity to care for  500  soldiers.  Forces  Command  and  the  Office  of  the  Surgeon

General developed the strategy for implementing the initiative, while their subordinate units, the continental United States armies and the regional  medical  commands,  were  responsible  for  carrying  it  out. After the pilot phase, the program was expected to be extended to the rest of the nation in FY 2005.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The  depot  maintenance  program  continued  to  be  an  integral part  of  Army  National  Guard  sustainment,  as  it  was  based  on  a 'repair-and-return-to-user' premise. Unlike the Regular Army, the Guard did not have a quantity of selected end items authorized for use by units as immediate replacements, known as floats, when critical equipment was returned to the depot for repair. Funding for the Army National Guard's depot maintenance program increased from 56 percent of requirement in FY 2003 to 66 percent of requirement in FY 2004. During the fiscal year, however, the amount of equipment qualifying for depot repair increased by 15 percent mainly because of the need to rebuild an aged tactical wheeled vehicle fleet.



## Management and Planning

A memorandum of agreement signed in August 2004 by the commander of Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology heralded a major new initiative for the management of Army logistics. Until then, the service's existing acquisition process had functioned along two separate chains of command. Development and procurement of a system was the responsibility of one of twelve program executive offices. Sustainment of a system once it was fielded was the responsibility of one of AMC's commodity commands. The Life Cycle Management Command initiative merged these two chains-each program executive office was realigned within a commodity command to form a life cycle management command. This change placed responsibility for the entire life cycle of a system under one commander and promised to create a synergy that would enhance the effectiveness of the Army's logistics efforts, delivering better products and capabilities to soldiers faster, while also minimizing total life-cycle cost across an entire grouping of systems. The establishment of life cycle management commands was expected to be completed in FY 2005. Additionally, the Army requested a waiver from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to permit the principal military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology to also serve as a deputy to the AMC commander.

In 2004, the Army Acquisition Corps implemented the Regionalization Program. Designed to provide professional development standardization, the program afforded captains and majors the opportunity to grow into positions of increasing responsibility. Regional senior acquisition officials (general officers or senior executive service civilians)  were  responsible  for  providing  officers  with  professional development  opportunities  through  multiple  assignments  within  a region to support diversification and professional development while broadening their overall acquisition experience. The program's goal was to stabilize each officer for forty-eight months. However, some officers could move after thirty-six months to pursue other profes-

sional development opportunities or to meet the greater needs of the service and the Army Acquisition Corps in different assignments.

During  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  Research,  Development  and Engineering Command was established at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, as a major subordinate command of Army Materiel Command. The new command oversaw the Army's research, development, and  engineering  centers;  the  Army  Research  Laboratory;  and  the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. The intent of the new command was to better integrate the services' research, development, and engineering management; to eliminate costly, duplicative research and development efforts; and to foster collaborative work among Army and other military research and development organizations.

In December 2003, the Army G-4 published a white paper, Delivering Materiel Readiness to the Army . The invasion of Iraq had highlighted that the service's logistics systems were not suited for a fastpaced, nonlinear battlefield. Analysis of this experience resulted in the white paper, which targeted four problem areas of logistics that require immediate attention. The first problem was that logisticians have less situational awareness than combat units equipped with systems such as Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below. The white paper called for the connection of logisticians as an integral part  of  the  joint  battlefield  network  with  satellite-based  communications. The second problem was that logisticians were not able to respond rapidly and precisely when support requirements were identified. The white paper called for a joint effort by the G-4, the Army Materiel Command, the Combined Arms Support Command, and the U.S. Transportation Command to develop solutions that would provide timely and accurate movement of supplies from the factory to the battlefield. The third problem was that the Army had not invested in the capability to receive forces in the theater, and during Operation IraqI Freedom it had to build ad hoc support organizations for aerial and seaport debarkation operations. The white paper called for the development of a dedicated theater force reception organization. The fourth problem was that decisions over the past several years reduced the various elements of the Army's logistical chain, leaving soldiers at the end of a long line of communications with reduced inventories and an old distribution system. The white paper called for taking an enterprise view of the supply chain, along with an integration of processes, information, and responsibilities among both the services and Department of Defense agencies.

The Office of the Secretary Defense in January 2004 transferred the responsibility for managing military-unique lithium batteries and related accessories from the Department of the Army to the Defense

Logistics Agency. This decision was based on criticisms of the Army's performance in supplying  these  items  during  the  invasion  of  Iraq. The Army did not concur with this decision. It argued that shortages for these items were the result of prewar funding shortfalls and the rapid advance of coalition forces that increased the consumption rate of batteries because units could not stop to set up their power generators. The service also contended that its Communications-Electronics  Command had developed a depth of expertise in this area that the Defense Logistics Agency could not quickly match. These arguments, however, did not reverse the decision, but CommunicationsElectronics Command would continue to be responsible for technical issues related to lithium batteries.

The Army Field Service Command began to reconstitute Army Pre-positioned  Stocks  (APS)  issued  for  Operation IraqI  Freedom and  to  apply  lessons  learned  from  that  experience.  The  APS  program includes equipment for armored brigades plus higher-echelon combat support and combat service support unit sets with necessary ammunition and supplies. This equipment is divided into elements assigned to the various geographic theaters and is based on land and on ships. In line with the emphasis on transforming the service into an  expeditionary  force,  the  APS  program  was  revised  during  the fiscal year. The afloat portion, known as APS-3, had been based at Diego Garcia, but was completely off-loaded during 2002-2003 for Operation IraqI Freedom . Instead of reconstituting APS-3, it is being transformed into three Army Regional Flotillas, each with a brigade set of two maneuver battalions. This change is a reduction in combat power from APS-3, but it  permitted  an  increase  in  items  required for  humanitarian  assistance  and  disaster  relief,  thereby  providing combatant commanders with more capability for stability and support operations. The three regional flotillas will be positioned in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea to provide a faster response to contingencies. None of the flotilla brigade sets had been completely filled with all authorized equipment by the end of FY 2004. The shortages were primarily caused by equipment remaining  in  theater  after  being  issued  from  APS-3  for  Operation IraqI Freedom .

To conduct sustainment operations for units deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,  additional  repair  and  maintenance  capabilities  were needed. By the end of FY 2004, the Army Field Service Command had begun establishing Equipment Support Activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The mission of the activities included providing command and control for all Army Materiel Command forward repair activities and maintaining Stay-Behind-Equipment life cycle maintenance and sus-

tainment stock management. The activity in Iraq was established in late FY 2004 and will reach full operating capability in FY 2005. The activity in Afghanistan was expected to be established in FY 2005.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

During FY 2004, the Army restructured or canceled 126 programs to free resources for more pressing wartime requirements. The most significant  of  these  decisions  was  the  cancellation  of  the  RAH-66 Comanche  helicopter,  an  armed  reconnaissance  helicopter  that  the service had begun developing in 1983 as the Light Helicopter Family program. The decision to cancel the Comanche came out of a study on the restructuring of Army aviation that incorporated operational experience  since  2001  and  an  analysis  of  threats  in  the  foreseeable future. The study found that the unique capabilities of the Comanche (the helicopter was hard to observe and had on-board diagnostics) were not vital in either the current or foreseeable operational environments. Furthermore, the study affirmed the need to provide the most effective survivability enhancements to rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft as soon as possible; to upgrade, modernize, and rebuild the attack, utility, and cargo helicopter fleets; and to replace the light observation and scout/ attack helicopter fleet as rapidly as possible.

RAH-66 Comanche helicopter



Approximately  $14  billion  had  been  programmed  between  FY 2004 and FY 2011 to purchase 121 Comanches. Based on the study's findings, the Army's senior leaders decided to use those funds instead to procure 796 new aircraft for the active and reserve components, and to enhance, upgrade, modernize, and rebuild over 1,400 aircraft from all three components. This decision would accelerate the modernization of reserve component aviation units and the development of unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities; provide additional resources for  the  Future  Cargo  Aircraft  program designed to improve intratheater lift capacity; develop a common cockpit for cargo and utility aircraft;  and  field  improved  deployability  and  sustainment  kits  for aviation units.

The difficulties encountered in the modernization of Army aviation also prevented the scheduled retirement in FY 2004 of the last of the Army's Vietnam War-era UH-1 Iroquois utility helicopters. Instead,  the  service  planned  to  keep  operating  approximately  147 UH-1s  until  FY  2008.  To  replace  these  aircraft  and  equally  aged OH-58 Kiowa scout helicopters, the Army in FY 2004 began the Light Utility Helicopter program. The acquisition strategy for this aircraft was to proceed quickly by procuring a commercial off-the-shelf aircraft that is already certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and to field the aircraft in 2006. The new helicopter would provide general aviation support for the institutional Army in the areas of training,  testing,  and  medical  evacuation.  For  the  Army  National Guard, the new helicopter would provide general aviation support in the United States. The light utility helicopter will not deploy into hostile combat environments.

The keystone  of  Army  modernization  was  the  Future  Combat Systems (FCS), a family of digitally networked systems: unattended ground  sensors,  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  and  unmanned  and manned ground vehicles. Using advanced technologies, the ground vehicles would be lighter than current systems, enabling more rapid deployment, while retaining a high level of protection and combat power. In December 2003, the Army signed a contract with the FCS lead systems integrator team of the Boeing Company and the Science Applications  International  Corporation  for  the  program's  systems development and demonstration phase. In March 2004, the Program Manager, Future Combat Systems, was renamed Program Manager, Unit of Action. The change reflected the scope of the office's responsibility and aligned its designation with its primary mission of fielding FCS-equipped units of action.

In  July  2004,  the  Army  restructured  the  FCS  program.  The new plan extended development by two years to 2014 and included

a detailed plan to spiral technologies out of the program and into the  current  force.  The  decision  to  extend  the  development  phase was based on a review, which concluded that the current schedule of  fielding  the  first  brigade-sized  unit  of  action  by  2012  was  too risky given the numerous advanced technologies vital to the FCS concept that still needed to be developed. Between 2004 and 2014, four  separate  spirals  of  selected  technologies  from  the  program will  be  fielded  to  the  current  force  to  enhance  its  capabilities. The spiral process will also give the service experience with these technologies,  further  reducing  the  risk  involved  in  fielding  the complex, interdependent system-of-systems FCS. One heavy brigade combat team will be selected to serve as an experimental and  evaluation  unit  for  FCS  technologies.  The  restructuring  will allow the reinstatement of systems deferred in 2003 for budgetary reasons: the Maintenance and Recovery Vehicle, the Class II and III unmanned air vehicles, the Intelligent Munitions, and the two Armed Robotic Vehicle subtypes. The delay in initial operational capability  and  the  new  requirement  for  spiral-out  development required substantial schedule changes and coordination among the numerous FCS program elements.

The Army and the Marine Corps in FY 2004 signed a memorandum of agreement to establish a joint program office that will bring together elements of the Army's FCS program and the Marines' Marine Air-Ground  Task  Force  Expeditionary  Family  of  Fighting  Vehicles program. The agreement sought to ensure that the vehicles produced by the two programs will be able to operate together, especially on network interoperability. The two services also sought to share expertise in certain advanced technologies, such as power trains, sensors, and weapons, which can be used in both vehicle families. The memorandum  established  a  two-phase  collaborative  process.  The  first  phase extends to FY 2008 and will include assessing the common and unique requirements of each program, exchanging liaison officers, and conducting joint experimentation. The second phase will seek to design systems, subsystems, and software common to both families of vehicles to  reduce life-cycle costs. In this phase, the two programs may also potentially share design and production facilities.

By the summer of 2003, the improvised explosive device (IED) had become the most dangerous threat to American troops in Iraq. The shift to counterinsurgency operations in that country enhanced the effectiveness of this weapon. The greater mobility, speed, and lower  maintenance  needs  of  the  HMMWV,  compared  to  tracked vehicles,  were  assets  in  such  a  campaign.  Additionally,  the  Army has large stocks of HMMWVs available for issue to nonmaneuver

M1114 High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles



units, such as field artillery, that had been assigned maneuver-type missions. Unfortunately, only the M1114 variant of the HMMWV had  armor  protection,  and  before  the  war,  Army  doctrine  had given this variant only a small role in operations, so few units were equipped with this model and production lines could produce just thirty  M1114s  per  month.  As  the  use  of  IEDs  increased  over  the summer of 2003, CJTF-7 began to submit requirements through the Joint Staff for armored wheeled vehicles. Those numbers increased rapidly during the fall of 2003, and the scope of this requirement was immense because by late 2003 the task force employed some 12,000 HMMWVs and 16,000 other wheeled vehicles.

The Army categorized the level of armor protection for noncombat vehicles using a three-tiered structure. Level I protection was provided for vehicles manufactured with armor built into the original design of the vehicle. Level II protection was achieved by installing armor  plates  and  ballistic-resistant  glass  that  provided  nearly  the same level of protection as Level I. Level III protection was created by the use of various ad hoc measures such as steel plates, sandbags, and other materiel, often referred to by soldiers as 'hillbilly armor.' To meet the urgent need in Iraq, the Army took steps to increase the number of Level I vehicles and produce kits that would provide unarmored HMMWVs with Level II protection. It also provided guidance for units on materiel used in creating Level III protection.

The requirements for M1114 HMMWVs increased faster than the Army's acquisition processes could meet them, growing from 1,407 vehicles  in  August  2003  to  8,105  vehicles  by  September  2004.  The Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command worked with manufacturers to increase production from 51 vehicles per month in August 2003  to  400  vehicles  per  month  in  September  2004.  By  the  end  of FY 2004, the Army had provided 5,330 of the 8,105 required M1114 HMMWVs-2,533 new vehicles and 2,797 redistributed to Iraq from elsewhere in the world. The contractor will increase the production level to its maximum capacity of 550 vehicles per month and should meet the theater's current requirements by March 2005. The pace of M1114 production generated  strong  public  and  congressional  criticism of the Army.

To meet the Level II up-armor requirement, the Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command contracted for the production of kits for the HMMWV in October 2003. Additionally, seven Army depots and arsenals managed by the Ground Systems Industrial Enterprise started  mass-producing  the  kits  in  December  2003.  The  first  fifteen  test  kits  were  flown  to  Kuwait  in  November  2003.  The  initial requirement from the theater was for 8,400 kits, and production levels increased so that the theater requirements would have been met by August 2004. During this same month, however, the Coalition Forces Land  Component  Command  increased  the  requirement  to  13,872 kits. Using both contractor and depot production, the Army expected to  fill  this  increase  by  early  in  calendar  year  2005.  As  with  M1114 production, the pace of kit production brought strong criticism of the Army and triggered a Government Accountability Office investigation, which concluded that Army facilities could have filled the original kit requirement in early 2004 without affecting other operations at the depots.

When Operation IraqI Freedom began in March 2003, not every soldier had been issued the latest version of Interceptor Body Armor. This equipment had been developed in the late 1990s, but given the service's budgets before FY 2002, the Army had planned to issue the updated Interceptor Body Armor between 2000 and 2007, with the priority of issue going to soldiers in direct combat positions. The new body armor, which was first used in Afghanistan, was a combination of Kevlar and ceramic plates that could stop high-powered rifle rounds. Based on this experience and experience during the invasion of  Iraq,  the  Army  accelerated  its  acquisition  of  Interceptor  Body Armor in May 2003 by ordering enough sets for every soldier in Iraq. The Central Command later in the year increased the demand further by requiring the armor for all Department of Defense personnel in its

area of operations. These two decisions increased the demand more than tenfold.

American manufacturers were not able to immediately meet this spike in demand for Kevlar and ceramic plates. The Department of Defense approved an exception under the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, allowing vest makers to use another type of fiber panel, manufactured overseas, as a replace  ment for Kevlar panels. In April 2004, a foreign firm opened a production facility in the United States to meet the demand for the material used to make the ceramic plates.  Attempts  to  accelerate  fielding  of  Interceptor  Body  Armor, even at the expense of some loss of accountability for vests and plates, met with some success, but the manufacturing bottlenecks left the Army unable to fully meet the increased demand by the end of FY 2004.

During FY 2004, the Army also worked to improve the protection provided by the Interceptor Body Armor vest by fielding a deltoid  and  axillary  addition.  These  new  pieces  protect  the  sides  and shoulders of soldiers from 9-mm. bullets and fragments from improvised explosive devices. Using an expedited procurement process, the Army awarded a three-year contract in June for 50,000 sets of the new pieces, in addition to an earlier contract for 10,000 sets that the service began shipping to Iraq in May.

The Army expanded its Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI) during FY 2004. The initiative had begun in 2002 after complaints from soldiers serving in Afghanistan that units did not have the funds to purchase needed equipment that was available either commercially or through normal supply channels, that current materiel fielding plans were not meeting the needs of the Army, and that many soldiers were purchasing items to make up for the inadequate quality and quantity of some organizational  clothing  and  individual  equipment  items.  Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier in late 2002 developed an equipment list of items for individuals and for small units that addressed these soldier  criticisms  and,  using  a  mix  of  government  and  commercial sources,  fielded  them  for  a  brigade  deploying  to  Afghanistan.  The success of this effort led the chief of staff of the Army in January 2004 to direct that the entire operational Army receive the RFI equipment by the end of FY 2007. Furthermore, he directed that in FY 2004 all units deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan be issued the items on the RFI list. He later directed that soldiers whose tour in Iraq had been extended also go through the RFI process. The mix of items on the RFI list was regularly updated to reflect operational experience and new materiel  developments.  In  FY  2004,  nineteen  brigade  combat teams and 105,000 support troops were issued items from the RFI list.

In  September  2004,  the  Defense  Acquisition  Board  approved the Army's plan for low-rate production of the Stryker Mobile Gun System. This vehicle used the same hull, suspension, power pack, and drive train as the Stryker infantry carrier, but mounted a 105-mm. gun in  an  unmanned  low-profile  turret  that  used  a  complex  autoloader and stabilization system. The engineering challenges of this system made the Mobile Gun System the most complex member of the Stryker vehicle family, requiring a much longer period of testing than other variants. Until it is fielded, brigades will use a Stryker variant mounting a launcher for the TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) antiarmor missile. The Army began testing Mobile Gun System prototypes in 2003 and soon found serious reliability problems with the ammunition handling equipment. While these problems did not end the program, the Defense Acquisition Board in its approval of low-rate production did mandate that the Army update the Stryker Systems Engineering Plan within ninety days to address these problems.

During  FY  2004,  the  Army  continued  development  of  the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) Increment I family of weapons to replace the M16/M4 family of weapons. The OICW is a dual-engagement weapon that will fire a new air-bursting highexplosive round and the standard 5.56-mm. rifle round. The weapon was approved as a new acquisition program in 2000, but delays in solving technical problems concerning the airburst round and the weight of the weapon led the Army to change its acquisition strategy in 2002 by separating the program into two parts. Increment I is the XM8 family of 5.56-mm. weapons and Increment II is the XM25 high-explosive airburst weapon. During FY 2004, the Army developed a second generation of XM8 prototypes, with changes based in part on field testing by soldiers in the 3d Infantry and 101st Airborne Divisions. Plans for fielding the XM8 also changed. Initially, the compact, carbine, and sharpshooter versions would have been fielded first, followed by the automatic rifle. Now, all four versions will be fielded at the same time by combining the sharpshooter and automatic rifle into a Designated Marksman Automatic Rifle; in the automatic role, it will use a 100-round drum magazine, while in the marksman role, it will use the 30-round magazine used in the carbine version. Testing of the second-generation prototypes under climatic extreme conditions began in late FY 2004, and a decision on full-rate production by the Army's senior leadership was expected in FY 2005.

Development  of  the  High-Mobility  Artillery  Rocket  System (HIMARS) continued during FY 2004. This truck-borne system can

A High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System



fire the same family of rockets as the tracked Multiple-Launch Rocket System (MLRS), but carries only one pod of six rockets instead of the two pods found on the MLRS. In January, the second low-rate production contract was signed for twenty-six systems, one of which was for the Marine Corps. Total acquisition is expected to be over 800 launchers for the Army and 40 launchers for the Marine Corps. The Army conducted the initial operational test for HIMARS in two phases. The ground phase occurred at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in September 2004, with a test platoon firing live missions with reducedrange practice rockets and exercising all aspects of fire missions. The flight phase will be conducted in early FY 2005 at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, where the HIMARS will fire basic and extendedrange rockets, the Global Positioning System-guided rocket, and the Army Tactical Missile System missile. The first HIMARS battalion was expected to be fielded later in FY 2005.

In FY 2004, the Army restructured the Line-of-Sight Antitank Missile (LOSAT) program. The LOSAT is the service's first kinetic energy missile and provides antiarmor capability for light, airborne, and air assault forces. The launcher is mounted on a HMMWV and carries four missiles. Originally five battalions armed with the missile, one for each light division, were to be fielded, but early in FY 2004, the number was reduced to one, although the requirement for

five battalions remains. The LOSAT had not yet met the probabilityof-kill  rates  set  by  its  operational  requirements  document  against threat-representative targets at ranges beyond the capability of antiarmor missiles in the current inventory. A next-generation, lighterweight penetrator rod system, the Compact Kinetic Energy Missile, was under development as a possible LOSAT replacement.

The Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below is a vehiclemounted  digital  battle  command  information  system  that  enables orders and graphics to be transmitted between leaders within a brigade  task  force.  The  system  also  includes  the  Blue  Force  Tracker, which generates a near real-time picture of friendly forces. The Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below was one of the most widely praised command and control systems used during the invasion of Iraq, and in FY 2004, the Army decided to begin full production with an initial order of 25,000 units. This number did not include the systems required for new units to be activated during the conversion to a  modular force structure. At the end of FY 2004, TRADOC was still  assessing how modularity would affect the program. Based on the favorable reception of Blue Force Tracker by units in Iraq, the Army decided to field nearly 40,000 systems over the next four years. The plan called for active component units that are currently without the system to receive it in the same densities as used by units in the invasion of Iraq. Within four years, all units will receive higher densities, including more vehicles within maneuver companies and combat support units.

Development  of  the  Warfighter  Information  Network-Tactical (WIN-T) to replace the Mobile Subscriber Equipment system began in 1999. WIN-T will be the Army's high-speed, high-capacity communications network that will allow tactical units to communicate beyondline-of-sight  while  on  the  move.  Originally,  the  program  focused  on designing  a  network  that  would  meet  current  force  needs.  In  2002, the program was realigned to focus on a network that would support future force needs. Two contractors began working independently on designing the future force network architecture, and the Army planned to select one design for procurement in FY 2006. The demands of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan led to a shift in focus during FY 2004: WIN-T would now develop and field network capabilities to meet both current and future force needs as quickly as possible. In September, the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  approved  the  Army's  plan  to expedite development by eliminating the competition between the two contractors and combining their efforts into a single design.

The service adopted the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) in FY 2004 to replace the Battle Dress Uniform and the Desert Camouflage

Uniform. Work on the ACU began in January 2003 and included field testing of prototypes in the United States and  Iraq.  The  final  version  of  the ACU included  thirty-one  significant changes from its predecessors, including wrinkle-free  fabric, redesigned pockets,  Velcro  insignia  instead  of sew-on,  and  no-shine  desert  boots instead of black boots. The new uniform  moved  rank  insignia  from  the collars  to  a  chest  tab  and  officers would not wear branch insignia. The ACU used a digital camouflage pattern  that  ends  the  need  for  separate woodland and desert camouflage pattern uniforms, and  is effective in  urban  environments.  The  service intended to start fielding the ACU to every deploying soldier in the spring of 2005 and have all soldiers, including those in the reserve components, wearing it by December 2007.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

In FY 2004, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) received $684 million in appropriated funds from Congress and $887 million in nonappropriated funds, primarily from cash register sales of goods or services. For appropriated funds, a $104 million increase over FY 2003 was mostly due to money from a wartime budget supplemental. For nonappropriated funds, revenue increased $26.6 million over FY 2003, the result of increased user fees and relatively stable sales despite the greater number of soldiers deployed. The Army and Air Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  payments  to  the  Army  MWR amounted to $128 million, a $4.1 million increase over FY 2003. The major use of funds continued to be personnel, at 53 percent of the total, no change from FY 2003. After operating costs, $155 million was available for capital requirements-$14 million more than FY 2003, half of which was due to an increased support for MWR in the Military Construction, Army, budget account.

Support to deployed soldiers expanded during FY 2004. Sixteen MWR civilian professionals deployed to Operation IraqI Freedom , Op  eration endurIng  Freedom ,  and  the  Balkans.  MWR  facilities operated at twenty-five large and twenty-two small sites in Iraq, three large and five small sites in Afghanistan, and two large and five small sites in Kuwait. Internet cafés for coalition personnel were now operational at 170 sites in Iraq, 3 in Afghanistan, and another café will be installed in Kuwait during FY 2005. The Community and Family Support Center shipped $19 million in MWR sports and recreation equipment to deployed soldiers in company- and battalion-sized kits, which include sports equipment, games, books, magazines, movies, musical CDs, and an array of audiovisual entertainment equipment.

The Army Community and Family Support Center developed the Virtual  Family  Readiness  Group  (FRG)  during  the  year.  The  Virtual FRG was a Web-based system that provided all the functionality of a traditional family readiness group in an ad hoc and online setting to meet the needs of geographically dispersed units and families of all three Army components. It linked deployed soldiers, families,

family readiness group leaders, unit commanders, rear detachments, and  other  family  readiness  personnel  on  a  controlled-access  Web por  tal. With technology to automate manual processes and provide enhanced  services  and  communications,  the  portal  facilitated  the exchange of information and provided a sense of community. The Army Community and Family  Support  Center  initially  developed the program in response to the decision to deploy a brigade of the 2d Infantry Division from Korea to Iraq. The division had been stationed in Korea since 1965 and almost all its soldiers serve there on one-year unaccompanied tours. Therefore, unlike units in the United States and Germany, units of the deploying brigade did not have a family readiness group. Before being released in FY 2006 for use by other units, the program will be broadened to include a unit Virtual FRG locator, a kids and teens area, a phone tree organization chart, emergency family plans, blogs, a training tracker, and metrics for the unit commander to determine the state of family readiness.

The Army developed another tool during FY 2004 to help families, the Family Readiness Support Assistance program. The pace of operations, with repeated deployments to combat zones, had overwhelmed the volunteer leadership in many units' family readiness group. The new program provides 298 full-time paid assistants to family readiness groups and to rear detachment commanders, primarily at the division and brigade echelons, and will be used in the active and the reserve components. The assistants are primarily contract, term, or temporary overhire positions, funded by wartime supplemental funding or unit funds, and managed by their respective major commands. These personnel were not meant to replace the volunteer leadership. Rather, assistants would reduce stress for volunteers by taking up much of the administrative  and  logistical  workload,  thereby  allowing  the  volunteers to concentrate on their unit's families.

Clubs  and  food,  beverage,  and  entertainment  operations  contributed essential funding to support MWR programs, with the service  operating  227  facilities  worldwide.  In  FY  2004,  the  program had net revenue of $168.7 million, a decrease of 0.8 percent from FY 2003. During FY 2004, fifty-three MWR theme operations and fifteen Orion Food Systems restaurants were in operation around the world,  which  provided  soldiers  and  their  families  with  full-service and quick-service casual dining on post. The program expanded to the other services as the Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard signed memorandums of agreement with the Community and Family Support Center to operate theme restau  rants and snack bars on their bases. The Name Brand Casual Dining initiative was developed to meet a demand for casual sit-down dining and to generate maximum

revenue for Army installations. The first unit to open was a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant at Patrick Henry Village, Heidelberg, Germany, in January 2004. This unit generated revenue that exceeded initial projections for the year, and the initiative was set to expand in FY 2005.

Operations at ninety-three garrison locations provided lodging and hospitality services that support readiness of the total force worldwide. Ninety-one percent of the 5.6 million occupied room nights in FY 2004 directly supported temporary-duty or permanent-changeof-station travelers. Army lodging saved $186 million in official travel costs (compared to lodging per diem), and travelers saved $25 million when  using  government  transportation  on  space-available  status. The 76.8 percent occupancy rate provided $215 million in nonappropriated funds revenues. The Army Lodging Wellness Plan for soldiers and their families opened its first hotel at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, in August 2004. The Northern Lights Inn was one of the first facilities to reflect the new Unified Facilities Criteria for Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection. The four Community and Family Support Centeroperated Armed Forces Recreation Centers were joint service facilities that provided family-oriented vacation recre  ation opportunities. The four centers were the Hale Koa Hotel in Hawaii, the Shades of Green in Florida, the Dragon Hill Lodge in Korea, and, opened in September 2004, the Edelweiss Lodge and Resort in Germany. The four  centers  generated  total  revenue  of  $123.4  million,  an  increase from FY 2003 of $17.1 million.

Compared to FY 2003, the Army Recreation Machine Program FY 2004 slot machine revenues were higher at $107.3 million, while amuse  ment machine revenues were down slightly to $8.6 million. The program was evaluating traditional amusement products and looking at new businesses to help offset the industry-wide decline in video. Coin-free  gaming  systems  continued  to  keep  slot  revenues  strong. During FY 2004, the program converted an additional 24 locations and 553 machines to coin-free. This conversion saves on personnel costs and eliminates the regulatory requirement of third-party command represen  tatives for slot machine cash collections. The introduction of higher jackpots in some coin-free gaming machines ensured that customers are provided state-of-the-art games, allowing them to take advantage of popular bonus features now offered throughout the industry.

Soldier-athletes posted another successful year for the All-Army Sports  Program.  Soldiers  continued  to  dominate  the  armed  forces team and individual sports competitions, with Army teams taking first-place  honors  in  six  of  fourteen  armed  forces  champion  ships. The U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program focused on the 2004

Summer  Olympic  Games  in  Athens,  Greece.  Fifty-four  sol  diers assigned to the program qualified for and competed in Olympic trials and seven soldiers earned spots on the U.S. Olympic team, and four additional soldiers went to Athens as training partners. Prior to the Olympics, soldier-athletes earned 157 med  als at national and international competitions in 2004.

## Army Continuing Education System

During FY 2004, the Army completed preparations for deploying the eArmyU program Army-wide on 1 October 2004. The program began in 2001 as a pilot project at three posts and has since expanded to thirteen other installations. The program will offer eligible enlisted soldiers the opportunity to work toward a college degree or certificate through Web-based instruction. Soldiers will have access to 146 certificate and degree programs offered by 29 accredited colleges and universities.  One  goal  of  the  program  at  its  inception  was  to  have 80,000  students  enrolled  by  2005,  but  funding  constraints  and  the increased operational tempo created by Operations endurIng Freedom and IraqI Freedom prevented reaching that goal.

Under the original program, soldiers needed at least three years remaining on their enlistment to be eligible for the full set of benefits. In addition to tuition assistance, students received a laptop computer, an Internet service provider, an email account, an online starter tutorial called eArmyU Boot Camp, digital library services, and technical support. The pilot program offered students an alternative path if they had less than three years remaining on their enlistment by forgoing the laptop for their own computer. These soldiers still received all the other elements of the program. Under both options, students were assigned a program mentor who provides counseling and encouragement to help students keep up with their course work. At the start of FY 2004, the Army revised eArmyU to reduce costs, raise the course completion rate, and improve its usefulness as a retention incentive. Once open to all soldiers, students would now be recommended by their commander, using an order of merit list with the names of soldiers who wanted to enroll. From that list, commanders would select those soldiers who display the maturity and self-discipline required to complete the program.

The revised eArmyU to be fielded in FY 2005 has several significant changes. Starting in October 2004, the laptop option, now called the eArmyU Technology Pack, will be limited to soldiers who reenlist for assignment in an operational unit. These students will receive a state-of-the-art laptop and will be required to successfully complete

twelve semester hours in three years instead of the current two years. They must have three years remaining on their active-duty service. The no-laptop option, now called eCourse enrollment, will be offered to all other soldiers. These students will use their own computer and will not have any remaining active-duty service requirement, although they must have sufficient remaining time in service to complete the eArmyU course. All eligible soldiers receive $250 per semester hour or up to 100 percent tuition, whichever is less, up to an annual ceiling of $4,500.

## Housing

The  Residential Communities  Initiative program  continued during FY 2004. This program was the Army's method for complying with the Military Housing Privatization Initiative mandated by Congress in 1996. This legislation gave the services the authority to leverage appropriated housing construction funds and governmentowned assets to attract private capital and expertise in an effort to improve the quality of on-post housing for service members and their families.  The  Army's  program  began  in  1998  and  focused  on  the total residential community, not just houses. The service intended to eliminate inadequate family housing by FY 2007 and inadequate permanent-party, single-soldier housing by FY 2008. By the end of FY 2004, nearly 42,000 houses across 19 installations had transitioned to privatized operations. Among the installations that transitioned to the program in FY 2004 were Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; and Fort Drum.

The Barracks Modernization Program consisted of two components: the Whole Barracks Renewal Program and the Barracks Upgrade Program. The former used Military Construction, Army, funds primarily for new construction. The latter used Operation and Maintenance, Army, funds for major renovations of early 1970s-era barracks and other barracks where it is more cost-effective to renovate  than  to  replace.  Host-nation  funding  in  Korea  and  Europe augmented both elements of the modernization program. Although the Department of Defense's goal was to eliminate inadequate permanent-party barracks by FY 2007, due to funding constraints, the Army will not meet the goal until after FY 2009. The Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management published an updated Army Barracks Master Plan in July 2004. The update provided the methodology for determining program requirements and evaluation  of  the  program;  specific  installation  and  regional  barracks  inventory  and  modernization  requirements;  years  in  which

new barracks complexes and major barracks upgrade projects are planned;  and  guidance  and  policy  concerning  standards  for  barracks complex facilities components.

## Army Safety Program

The Army lost 268 soldiers from accidents in FY 2004, a 3 percent increase from FY 2003 and a 28 percent increase above the previous three years'  average.  Aviation  accidents  resulted  in  the  loss  of twelve soldiers, a 65 percent decrease from FY 2003 and a 43 percent decrease below the previous three years' average. Ground accidents claimed the lives of 256 soldiers, a 13 percent increase from FY 2003 and a 35 percent increase over the previous three years' average. Of the ground fatalities, privately owned vehicle accidents killed 131 personnel, a 27 percent increase from FY 2003 and a 30 percent increase from the previous three years' average. Fifty fatalities resulted from Army motor vehicle and Army-operated vehicle accidents, a 39 percent increase from FY 2003 and a 105 percent increase from the previous three years' average. Fourteen soldiers died in Army combat vehicle accidents, a 13 percent drop from FY 2003, but a 58 percent increase  from  the  previous  three  years'  average.  Other  personal injury accidents, including training and recreational activities, killed sixty-one soldiers, a 14 percent decline from FY 2003, but a 3 percent increase from the previous three years' average.

Twelve  Army  civilian  employees  died  in  job-related  activities during  FY  2004.  Army  civilian  employees  filed  9,542  job-related injury claims, a decrease of less than one percent from FY 2003. The main causes of these injuries were falls, physical stress, slips and trips, and motor vehicle accidents.

Early in FY 2004, the rate of soldier deaths from accidents surpassed that for the same period in FY 2003. The acting secretary of the  Army  therefore  directed  the  Army  Safety  Center  to  develop  a safety campaign. The ' Be Safe! ' campaign had the goal of reducing preventable accidents by at least 50 percent by the end of FY 2005. The focus was on the three areas that comprise 97 percent of Army accidents  and  fatalities:  vehicular  accidents,  personal  injuries,  and aviation. Acting Secretary Brownlee, General Schoomaker, and Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth O. Preston appeared in the Army Campaign Safety video. The Army Safety Center posted new riskmanagement and communications tools on its Web site. Leaders of all  Army  organizations  were  required  to  inform  all  personnel  and families about the 'Be Safe!' campaign and garner support from the public; convey Army institutional risk-management knowledge and

lessons learned to the lowest level; leverage the best safety practices from industry, other Army organizations, and other services; teach risk management as part of fieldcraft training in realistic scenarios; and measure progress quarterly, revise the plan as required, recognize excellence, and uphold accountability.

In  FY 2004, sixty-four  interns  were  hired  for  the  Army  Safety and Occupational Health Management Career Program-the largest  group  of  interns  since  FY  1990.  The  group  consisted  of  safety specialists, industrial hygienists, safety engineers, and health physicists.  These  interns  were  placed  in  operational  brigades,  garrison organizations, and major command headquarters. During the year, fifty interns received the national designation of Certified Safety and Health Official through a certification program developed by a partnership  between  the  Texas  Engineering  Extension  Service  and  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

The U.S. Army Safety Center developed two online safety courses in conjunction with two contractors: the Commander's Safety Course and the  Additional  Duty  Safety  Course.  The  Commander's  Safety Course was a requirement directed by the chief of staff of the Army for  all  commanders,  to  educate  commanders  and  other  leaders  on how  to  better  manage  their  unit  safety  programs.  The  Additional Duty Safety Course was required for military additional-duty safety personnel  and  available  for  Department  of  Army  collateral-duty safety officers, supervisors, and employee safety representatives. The release of this course established the Army standard for trained and qualified military additional-duty safety personnel.

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

At the direction of the Installation Management Board of Directors, the Installation Management Agency (IMA) in 2003 began developing a standard garrison organization. The intent was to develop a structure that provided a common means of managing installations worldwide; created optimal professional relationships among related functions; eliminated redundancy in garrison staffing; set the stage for implementation of the Common Levels of Support concept; and standardized training and professional development among garrison employees.  In  May  2004,  HQDA  approved  IMA's  concept,  which standardized  management  and  organizational  terminology,  roles, responsibilities,  position  descriptions,  and  terms  of  reference.  It prescribed garrison staff  organization  from  directorate  level  down to division level, but did not prescribe organizational level down to branch level.

Development of the Common Levels of Support concept continued during FY 2004. This concept will provide a method for ensuring the delivery of high-quality base operations support services that meet the Army Baseline Standards now included in installation status reports. Implementation of the concept will assist in meeting these standards within the funds allocated to the IMA, which do not always cover all requirements. Common Levels of Support will allow the distribution of resources in a consistent and equitable manner. During FY 2004, service  analysis  teams,  organized  with  a  cross-section  of  expertise within  IMA,  met  to  develop  priorities  among  the  various  support programs,  overall  performance  metrics,  and  necessary  financial data. The concept was expected to be presented to the Installation Management Board of Directors for approval early in FY 2005.

In the FY 2003 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress ended its prohibition on the use of contract security guards at domestic military installations and gave the service secretaries the authority  to  enter  into  contracts  for  these  guards.  The  IMA  in  FY  2003 established a multiphased program to substitute contract guards for military police at Army installations in the continental United States, thereby releasing soldiers whose specialty was in high demand in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March 2004, IMA completed the third phase of the program with sole-source contracts.

Ground was broken in September 2004 for a new National Infantry  Museum  in  Columbus,  Georgia.  The  National  Infantry  Foundation,  a  private  nonprofit  organization,  was  organized  in  1998  to raise  funds  for  construction  of  this  facility,  which  will  be  built  on land donated by Fort Benning and the city of Columbus. The new 150,000-square-foot facility will replace the current museum at Fort Benning, whose size and condition is inadequate to properly maintain and display the large collection of artifacts. The foundation's board of directors will govern the new facility, but Army civilian employees who constitute the museum's staff will manage the exhibits and artifacts. Construction was expected to be completed in 2006.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

In January 2004, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Gulf Region Division,  was  activated  in  Baghdad,  Iraq.  The  division  consisted  of three districts: North, headquartered in Mosul; South, headquartered in Al Basrah; and Central, headquartered in Baghdad. Creation of the Gulf Region Division consolidated into one organization the different U.S. Army Corps of Engineers activities operating in Iraq: Task Force Restore Iraqi Oil, Task Force Restore Iraqi Electricity, Iraq Provisional Command, and the forward engineer support teams. The new organization's initial missions were to support military construction and the construction management component of the Coalition Provisional Authority's Program Management Office. In June 2004, with the establishment of an interim Iraqi government and the inactivation of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the Program Management Office split  into  two  parts:  the  Iraq  Reconstruction  Management  Office, responsible for coordinating the reconstruction effort, and the Project and Contracting Office, which assumed the construction management function. The commander of the Gulf Region Division served as deputy director for programs and construction for the Project and Contracting Office.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published the civil works strategic plan for FYs 2004 to 2009 in March 2004. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers every five years prepare a strategic plan laying out broad goals and objectives for the next five years. The 2004 plan identified five national water resources challenges. The first was achieving greater balance between traditional water resources demands and environmental objectives.    The  second  was  restoring  the  vitality  of  the  environment from degradation caused by past development. The third was addressing the performance and safety implications of an aging water resources infrastructure.  The  fourth  was  ensuring  the  capability  to  respond  to natural disasters and terrorism threats to water resources infrastructure. The fifth was minimizing institutional barriers to efficient and effective water resources planning, decision making, and management.

This  analysis  produced  five  goals  for  the  next  five  years.  First, provide  sustainable  development  and  integrated  management  of  the nation's water resources. Second, repair past environmental degradation and prevent future environmental losses. Third, ensure that projects  perform  to  meet  authorized  purposes  and  evolving  conditions. Fourth, reduce vulnerabilities and losses to the nation and the Army from  natural  and  man-made  disasters,  including  terrorism.  Fifth, maintain a solid technical foundation in its core competencies in engineering and related sciences, and promote organizational effectiveness and fiduciary integrity. The plan detailed the strategies the Corps of Engineers will use to meet these goals over the next five years.

The Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management published the Army Historic Preservation Campaign Plan in October 2003. Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires that the Army establish a program to ensure that preservation of historic properties under the service's control occurs consistent with the Army mission. This campaign plan was the foundation of the Army's historic preservation program. Complying with the National Historic Preservation Act presented a major challenge, as the service has identified 66,000 historic buildings and structures and 90,000 archeological sites on Army property that are subject to the act. The campaign plan established goals, objectives to meet the goals, specific targets with lead offices to implement actions, and success indicators to measure progress in meeting the objectives and goals.

Four major hurricanes hit the southeastern United States in FY 2004. Landfall of these four hurricanes all occurred within a sevenweek period in August and September. Four divisions of the Corps of Engineers were affected: South Atlantic Division, Mississippi Valley Division, Great Lakes and Ohio River Division, and North Atlantic Division.  The  Federal  Emergency Management Agency tasked the Corps of Engineers with response and recovery mission assignments that exceeded $630 million. Over 1,700 corps employees were assigned to support the multiple response and recovery efforts.

## Environmental Protection

During  the  year,  work  continued  on  updating  the  Army  strategy for the environment, the first update since 1992. This update was prompted by the need to address major changes in the factors affecting environmental matters, such as advances in technology, the rise of nonstate adversaries, and increasing global population and urbanization. Furthermore, sustaining the support of the American people required the Army to be a sound steward of resources by applying

a  mission-oriented  systems  approach  to  managing  environmental issues across the Army. Publication of the strategy was expected early in FY 2005.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The Army has six categories of small and disadvantaged businesses.  In  FY  2004,  the  Army  awarded  contracts  worth  $2  billion to women-owned small business. Firms in historically underutilized business zones received $1.6 billion in contracts. Historically black colleges  and  universities/minority  institutions  were  awarded  contracts  worth $42.9 billion. Small business had $18.9 billion in contracts. The service awarded small disadvantaged businesses $6.4 billion in contracts. Contracts worth $1.1 billion went to veteran-owned/ service-disabled firms.

## Army Audit Agency

During FY 2004, the Army Audit Agency published 245 formal audit reports that contained 759 recommendations to improve Army operations. It also issued 149 memorandum reports that provided Army leaders with vital information on programs. Additionally, the agency reported $2.3 billion in monetary benefits for the Army$1.2 billion in formal benefits and $1.1 billion in additional benefits.

In the wake of several high-profile accounting scandals, government auditing standards placed a renewed emphasis on independent audit services. The agency significantly reduced the workload related to nonaudit services and redirected those resources to completing more formal audit engagements. At the same time, a new audit planning process was implemented that linked audit issue areas to the strategic objectives set by the Army's Strategic Readiness  System.  Among  the  audits  conducted  in  accordance with  this  concept  were  ones  on  training-base  and  first-term  soldier attrition, tactical software maintenance, management of contingency stocks, and land-use controls and monitoring at former defense sites.

During FY 2004, the Army Audit Agency published six formal audit  reports  and  three  memorandum  reports  in  support  of  Army contingency  operations.  Audit  teams  traveled  to  Bosnia,  Turkey, Afghanistan,  Uzbekistan,  Kuwait,  and  Iraq  to  perform  timely engagements in support of Operations JoInT Forge, endurIng Freedom, and IraqI Freedom . Recommendations from these audits identified more than $288 million in monetary benefits for the Army.

Audit cycle time is an indicator of how well the agency is meeting the needs of its Army clients. Cycle time is the number of elapsed days-start date to final report-it takes to complete an audit, and includes time spent coordinating command comments and incorporating the official Army position into reports. The goal was to reduce cycle time by FY 2006 to 15 percent from the FY 2003 baseline-at 5 percent a year. To measure progress toward this goal, cycle time by functional audit team and by agency-wide averages were tracked. During  FY  2004,  this  goal  was  achieved.  Agency-wide  cycle  time decreased seventeen days for formal reports and twenty-one days for memorandum reports.  Nine  of  fifteen  functional  audit  teams  also had lower elapsed days during FY 2004 for both formal and memorandum reports.

## Legal Affairs

Compared to FY 2003, there was a 6.1 percent drop in general courts-martial, a 5.1 percent increase in bad conduct discharge special courts-martial, a 76.2 percent drop in non-bad conduct discharge special  courts-martial,  and  a  12  percent  drop  in  summary  courtsmartial ( Table  5 ).  During  FY  2004,  nonjudicial  punishment  was imposed in 42,004 cases, a rate per one thousand of 84.97. This rate was a drop of 2.49 percent from the FY 2003 rate.

Source : 'Report of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004' in Annual Report Submitted to the Committees on Armed Services of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives and to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force .

During the fiscal year, military judges presided over the trial of all  Army special and general courts-martial worldwide, including 137 trials in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Bosnia. The eighteen active-duty trial judges were augmented with one mobilized Army

Reserve judge. The other thirteen Army Reserve judges tried cases throughout the world during periods of annual training. Efforts to protect soldiers' Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were complicated by deployments of witnesses, victims, and accused soldiers. The caseload remained about the same as in FY 2003, and down only slightly from FY 2002, despite widespread troop deployments.

In  FY  2003,  the  Judge  Advocate  General's  Legal  Center  and School was established in Charlottesville, Virginia, in order to centralize all officer, warrant officer, and enlisted training at the Judge Advocate General's School. The Legal Center and School was completed in June 2004 when the Judge Advocate General's Noncommissioned Officer Academy moved from Fort Jackson to Charlottesville. The first Basic Noncommissioned Officer Course will begin in October 2004 and the first Advanced Noncommissioned Officer Course will begin in November 2004.

## War Crimes

In January 2004, a soldier turned over to the Criminal Investigation Division evidence of detainee abuse by other soldiers at the Abu Ghraib Prison, the location of the Baghdad Central Confinement  Facility  and  the  Joint  Interrogation  Debriefing  Center.  The commander of CJTF-7 directed an investigation, in accordance with Army  Regulation  (AR)  15-6, Procedures  for  Investigating  Officers and Boards of Officers ,  of  the  800th  Military  Police  Brigade's  conduct of detention and internment operations from November 2003 to January 2004. The investigation found that soldiers at the facility had abused detainees, that these soldiers had not received training on how to operate this type of facility, and that leaders at all echelons in both the 800th Military Police Brigade and the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade had not properly supervised their subordinates. This report was classified, but was leaked to the media later in the year. Publication of photographs of the abuse taken by soldiers committing these acts generated strong international criticism of the Army, and undermined the legitimacy of American operations in Iraq.

In March 2004, CJTF-7 began another AR 15-6 investigation of Abu Ghraib, this time to investigate alleged misconduct by personnel assigned to or attached to the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade at the facility from August 2003 to February 2004. In June 2004, the acting secretary of the Army directed that an additional investigating officer be appointed who, in addition to reviewing the brigade's operations, would determine whether organizations or personnel at echelons  above  the  brigade  were  involved  directly  or  indirectly  in

any questionable activities regarding detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. Completed in August 2004, this combined investigation found that soldiers and contractors had abused detainees and it agreed with the earlier  investigation  that  leaders  in  both  brigades  did  not  properly supervise subordinates at Abu Ghraib. The report also identified systemic problems and issues that contributed to the volatile environment in which the abuse occurred. These systemic problems included inadequate  interrogation  doctrine  and  training,  an  acute  shortage of military police and military intelligence soldiers, the lack of clear lines of responsibility between the military police and military intelligence chains of command, the lack of a clear theater interrogation policy, and intense pressure felt by personnel to produce actionable intelligence from detainees. Furthermore, the CJTF-7 headquarters had failed to ensure proper staff oversight of detention and interrogation operations, and had reacted inadequately to earlier indications and warnings that problems existed at Abu Ghraib. This investigation also concluded that the Central Intelligence Agency had been conducting unilateral and joint interrogation operations at Abu Ghraib, and that the agency's detention and interrogation practices, including the death of a detainee during interrogation, created the perception among some soldiers that such practices were legitimate.

By the end of FY 2004, two soldiers had pled guilty at courtsmartial for abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib, and a number of officers  had  received  general  officer  reprimands.  Other  court-martial proceedings were still under way at the end of the fiscal year. To better supervise detainee operations throughout Iraq, CJTF-7 established the position of deputy commanding general for detainee operations. The Army dispatched a mobile training team from the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to conduct a course at major detainee facilities in Iraq on how to operate such facilities.

Detainee abuse in Iraq was not limited to Abu Ghraib during FY 2004. The increasing violence of the insurgency and the resultant pressure for actionable intelligence persuaded some soldiers that they were morally justified in using abusive interrogation techniques. Two detainees died while being interrogated at facilities operated by the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. In one case, investigators recommended charging eleven soldiers, but the commanders of these soldiers determined that the detainee had died as a result of the lawful application of force. In the second case, an interrogator received a general officer letter of reprimand.

On 10 February 2004, the acting secretary of the Army directed the Inspector General to conduct an assessment of detainee operations  in  Afghanistan and Iraq. This inspection was not an investi-

gation of any specific incidents or units but rather a comprehensive review of how the Army was conducting detainee operations in these two countries. Completed in July 2004, the inspection was unable to identify any systemic failures as causes of detainee abuse. Rather, it found that detainee abuse was the result of individual soldiers failing to follow known standards of discipline and Army values, and the failure of a few leaders to enforce standards of discipline.

Two assessments related to detainee operations spurred by events at  Abu  Ghraib  had  not  been  completed  by  the  end  of  FY  2004. Because soldiers in several Army Reserve units had abused or were alleged to have abused detainees, the commanding general of U.S. Army Reserve Command in March 2004 directed his inspector general to assess the training of Army Reserve units on the Law of Land Warfare,  detainee  treatment,  ethics,  and  leadership.  In  May  2004, the  CJTF-7  commander  initiated  a  review  of  detainee  operations within the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula and the 5th Special Forces Group. Both assessments were expected to be completed early in FY 2005.

The revelation of detainee abuse in Iraq prompted the commander of Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan in May 2004 to direct an inspection of detainee operations in Afghanistan. Completed the next  month,  the  inspection  reported  that  detainee  operations  were functional,  but  lacked  cohesive  direction  and  that  while  there  was clear theater guidance on detainee operations, it had not been successfully  transmitted  to  subordinate  units.  Given  the  terms  of  its appointment  order,  the  inspection  did  not  examine  military  interrogation of detainees, nor did it investigate allegations of detainee abuse. The inspection did note the same problems found in Iraq with permitting the Central Intelligence Agency to hold and interrogate detainees within a military facility.

In September 2004, an Army Reserve military police soldier was charged with assault and other crimes in connection with the death of  two  detainees  in  December  2002  at  the  Bagram  Control  Point in Afghanistan. The investigation of these deaths by the Criminal Investigation Command had identified additional soldiers from the same Army Reserve military police company and from the Regular Army 519th Military Intelligence Battalion as also being involved in these deaths. Charges against these soldiers were expected to be announced in early FY 2005. The Criminal Investigation Command further concluded that military intelligence personnel had abused other  detainees  at  the  facility.  The  investigations  in  FY  2004  of abuse at Abu Ghraib found that soldiers from the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion who had served at the Bagram facility and

then  been  sent  to  Iraq  had  used  improper  interrogation  methods developed in Afghanistan on detainees at Abu Ghraib.

## The Army and Arms Control

The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency (CMA) manages the program to safely store and destroy all U.S. chemical warfare materiel with joint oversight from the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology and the commanding general of U.S. Army Materiel Command. Two chemical stockpile disposal facilities in Colorado and Kentucky are managed by the program manager for Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives, who directly reports to the under secretary of defense for acquisition, logistics, and technology, in accordance with Public Law 105-261.

The  United  States  maintained  compliance  with  the  Chemical  Weapons Convention during FY 2004. By the end of the year, CMA had destroyed 28.7 percent of the declared Category I chemical weapons stockpile and was on track to meet the extended deadline of December 2007 for destruction of 45 percent of Category I chemical weapons. In addition, the United States met the convention's milestone for 80 percent destruction of former chemical weapons production facilities in December 2003, sixteen months ahead of the April 2005 deadline. During FY 2004, CMA chemical disposal facilities destroyed 1,639 tons of chemical agent (5.2 percent) out of the original U.S. stockpile of 31,498 tons of chemical agent.

One facility was closed and one facility was opened during FY 2004. The chemical stockpile that was stored on Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean had been completely destroyed, and the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System was closed in December 2003. Removal of the contaminated coral was completed in June 2004. Final closure verification sampling was completed in June 2004 and results from this sampling were being used for the ecological and human health risk assessments.

The Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility in Oregon began operations in September 2004 with the delivery of the first GB nerve agent M55 rocket. Umatilla was the fourth operational chemical disposal facility in the continental United States.

During the fiscal year, fourteen Category II chemical events (defined in accordance with AR 50-6, Chemical Surety ) occurred at CMA facilities. Seven of these events involved leaking munitions or containers in storage facilities and the other seven events occurred during demilitarization operations. In addition, fifty-five Category I chemical events and no Category III chemical events occurred during FY 2004. None of the events resulted in agent exposure of personnel or agent release to the environment.

## 9 Conclusion

FY 2004 was a year of war for the Army. Much of its operational force, including from the reserve components, was either deployed, recovering from a deployment, or preparing to deploy. The number of casualties increased significantly over the previous year, and for the first time since the Vietnam War, the Army had to deal with the consequences of war crimes committed by its soldiers.

Supporting  a  large-scale  commitment  of  units  had  effects  far from the battlefield. Signs appeared that the risk of a combat deployment was negatively affecting recruiting, retention, and morale in all three components. Thousands of soldiers had their active-duty service involuntarily extended by stop-loss orders. The education system for officers and noncommissioned officers had to be modified. Lessons from the battlefields reshaped training programs.

Committed to using unit rotation instead of individual rotation as in Vietnam, the Army began implementing a number of force stabilization initiatives to improve unit readiness for service in overseas theaters. The size of the Regular Army, even with the temporary increase in authorized strength obtained in the fiscal year, proved inadequate for these commitments and required the largest mobilization of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve since the Korean War. This mobilization, in turn, created a new emphasis inside and outside the Army, on rebalancing the relationships between the three components, and also revealed several serious flaws in the mobilization process.

The war affected materiel issues. The initial phase of Operation IraqI  Freedom had  highlighted  that  the  service's  logistics  systems were  not  suited  for  a  fast-paced,  nonlinear  battlefield,  and  during FY 2004, Army logisticians worked on resolving these shortcomings. The nature of counterinsurgency combat in Iraq created unexpected materiel demands, most notably for up-armored wheeled vehicles and soldier  body  armor,  demands  that  the  Army  could  not  completely meet by the end of the fiscal year. Critiques from soldiers and units prompted a major expansion of the Rapid Fielding Initiative, while praise  for  digital  battle  command  information  systems  led  to  an accelerated acquisition schedule for these items.

Transformation also felt the effects of the war. General Schoomaker's  decision  to  move  to  a  modular,  brigade-based  force

structure was motivated in large part by the need to create a longer interval  between  unit  rotations  to  combat  zones.  The  pressures placed on Army human and materiel resources had a major effect on the design of the new brigade combat teams. The need to improve current forces capabilities was a key reason for the cancellation of the RAH-66 Comanche program and the restructuring of the FCS program. The transformation effort passed an important milestone in FY 2004 with the successful combat debut in Iraq of the Stryker brigade combat team. At the conclusion of FY 2004, the foreseeable future for the Army continued to be that of a wartime force.
