## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2018

## 1 Introduction

The Army entered fiscal year (FY) 2018 operating on a continuing resolution  instead  of  an  approved  National  Defense  Authorization Act. Nevertheless, the service continued working toward a force with the  characteristics  necessary  for  success  in  an  increasingly  uncertain and  complex  security  environment,  one  that  included  the  possibility of conflict with an opponent that had similar or even superior highintensity  combined  arms  capabilities.  At  the  same  time,  the  demand from  combatant  commands  for  Army  forces  remained  high,  and American soldiers continued to be killed and wounded in action. Senior Army leaders set readiness and modernization as the service's highest priorities. To that end, during FY 2018 they initiated several efforts to improve organizations, processes, and concepts in these two areas.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

Organizational Changes

As  fiscal  year  (FY)  2018 began, Under Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy was serving as the acting secretary of  the  Army.  In  July  2017, President Donald J. Trump had nominated Mark T. Esper to be the next secretary of the Army, and on 15 November 2017, he was confirmed.

## Army Futures Command

In October 2017, the Army established a pilot program of eight cross-functional teams  to  improve  the  quality and  speed  of  materiel  development  activities.  The  teams were  Long  Range  Precision Fires;  Next-Generation  Com-

bat Vehicle; Future Vertical Lift; Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence; Air and Missile Defense; Soldier Lethality; Assured Position, Navigation, and Timing; and Synthetic Training Environment. The teams developed capability documents, informed in  appropriate  cases  by  experimentation  and  technical  demonstrations. After approval by senior leaders, the teams rapidly transitioned these  capability  requirements  into  the  Army's  acquisition  system. Each team was led by a brigadier general as its director, and each reported directly to the under secretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army.

Team personnel came from organizations in requirements, acquisition, science and technology, test and evaluation, resourcing, contracting,  costing,  and  acquisition  logistics  domains.  U.S.  Army Forces  Command  (FORSCOM)  and  Army  Service  Component Commands,  as  applicable, also provided personnel. The  teams leveraged  expertise  from  industry  and  academia  where  appropriate. The  organizations  providing  the  personnel  used  existing  positions on their tables of distribution and allowances to staff the teams and continue funding the personnel.

In  June  2018,  General  Order  2018-10  established  United  States Army  Futures  Command  (AFC),  effective  1  July  2018  with  full operating capability no later than 1 July 2019. The mission of AFC is  to  modernize  the  Army  by  developing  future  force  requirements, designing future force organizations, and delivering prototype materiel capabilities. Its commanding general is a four-star assignment, making AFC a peer of U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), FORSCOM, and U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).

The secretary of the Army chose this reorganization for several reasons. The new  command  will  link operational concepts to requirements,  acquisition,  and  fielding.  It  will  bring  concepts  and requirements definitions together-with engineering and acquisition functions-into one team. Its small and agile headquarters will focus on  flexibility,  collaboration,  and  speed,  producing  a  faster  cycle  of innovation,  experimentation,  and  demonstration.  Finally,  AFC  will enable  rapid  prototyping  and  increased  operational  inputs  to  the modernization effort.

The AFC commanding general reports through the chief of staff of the Army to the secretary of the Army, and coordinates with the assistant secretary of the Army (acquisition, logistics, and technology) on all matters pertaining to research, development, and acquisition. The principal military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army (acquisition,  logistics,  and  technology)-now  the  AFC's  director, Combat  Systems-also  advises  the  AFC  commanding  general  on all issues pertaining to research, development,  acquisition,  and contracting.

The  cross-functional  teams  established  in  2017  were  assigned to  AFC.  The  Army Capabilities  Integration  Center  was  transferred from TRADOC to AFC. Also transferred from TRADOC to the new command  were  the  TRADOC  Analysis  Center  and  the  Capability Development  and  Integration  Directorates,  from  each  center  of excellence.  In  FY  2019,  the  U.S.  Army  Research, Development and Engineering  Command  and  the  Army  Materiel  Systems  Analysis Activity will move from Army  Materiel Command  to AFC.

All  organizations  reassigned  to  AFC  will  remain  at  their  current locations. The new command is headquartered in Austin, Texas. Placing the  headquarters  in  a  major  metropolitan  area  that  has  innovative industrial and academic institutions will allow close cooperation with civilian  organizations,  stimulating  the  innovative  technology  culture required by the Army's modernization effort.

At the end of FY 2018, AFC comprised a headquarters and three subcommands:  Futures  and  Concepts,  Combat  Development,  and Combat Systems. The Futures and Concepts subcommand identifies and prioritizes capability development needs and opportunities. The Combat  Development  subcommand  conceptualizes  and  develops solutions for identified needs and opportunities. The Combat Systems subcommand  refines,  engineers,  and  produces  developed  solutions. The command headquarters sets the strategic direction, integrates the Army's  modernization  enterprise,  aligns  resources  to  priorities,  and maintains accountability.

## Army Reform Initiative

Secretary Esper established the Army Reform Initiative (ARI) in April 2018. His assessment concluded that over the past several years, Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army  (HQDA),  had  grown  too

large and assumed too much authority. This increase placed greater burdens on subordinate commands, narrowed the authority of leaders in the field, and unnecessarily delayed the completion of actions. The intent of the ARI is to push authorities and responsibilities down to the lowest level capable of exercising them and place more decisionmaking authority in commands across the Army. A smaller HQDA will  be  focused  on  policy,  enterprise-wide  priorities,  and  matters  of strategic importance.

The ARI identified HQDA core tasks. It then determined which noncore  activities  and  lower-priority  tasks  should  be  eliminated  or reduced; which tasks and functions could be moved to subordinate commands; which business processes could be automated; and which processes, procedures, and reports should be modified or eliminated. Army major command headquarters participated in the ARI as well. They used the same identification process to evaluate their relationships with  their  subordinate  commands.  They  also  proposed  tasks  and functions they believed should be realigned to them from HQDA.

The Office of Business Transformation was the HQDA lead office for  the  initiative,  with  support  from  the  staff  of  the  G-8's  Army Quadrennial Defense Review office. The director of the Army Staff, in conjunction with the deputy under secretary of the Army, the deputy chief management officer, the administrative assistant to the secretary of the Army, the General Counsel, and the Judge Advocate General, provided  oversight  to  the  ARI  working  group,  which  consisted  of subject matter experts from HQDA, the Army major commands, and the Installation Management Command.

The  ARI  working  group  received  690  recommendations  from within  HQDA  and  from  major  commands,  and  assessed  each  as providing high value, medium value, or low value, if implemented. It created three categories for recommendations. Category A addressed efficiencies,  such  as  terminating  unnecessary  processes  or  realigning where  certain  tasks  should  be  accomplished.  Category  B  addressed manpower  and  risk  analysis.  Category  C  addressed  headquarters structural efficiencies. Category  D  addressed  continuous  process improvement and business process reengineering. The working group further characterized each Category A recommendation by tier. Tier 1  recommendations  were  determined  to  be  sufficiently  developed to be included in Army program and budgeting decisions by 1 July 2018. Tier 2 recommendations needed further analysis, but could be ready for an Army senior leader decision by 1 September 2018. Tier 3 recommendations needed more extensive analysis to the extent that they could be included in the Army's next programming and budgeting decision cycle.

The Quadrennial Defense Review office reviewed and assessed more than 400 Category A recommendations, each accompanied by a two-page justification paper with facts and background information including stakeholder views and legal review from the Office of the General Counsel. During FY 2018, more than 160 recommendations were  withdrawn,  22  consolidated  with  similar  proposals,  and  41 approved  or  disapproved  by  the  under  secretary  of  the  Army and vice  chief  of  staff  of  the  Army.  Approximately  120  Category A  recommendations  remain  for  adjudication,  with  completion estimated by the end of March 2019.

## Review of Required Activities

As part of efforts to build a more capable and ready force, in April  2018,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  directed  HQDA  to  begin a  systematic  simplification,  reduction,  or  elimination  of  required activities  at  brigade  level  and  below.  The  reduction  focused  on requirements that consume the time units might otherwise spend building and sustaining readiness. Furthermore, commanders would have full authority while making prudent risk-informed decisions to simplify, reduce, or eliminate those tasks that are not combat related while ensuring they maintain a positive command environment and uphold Army values. By the end of FY 2018, HQDA eliminated the Travel Risk Planning System, Media Awareness training, and Combating Trafficking in Persons training. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and  Nuclear  training, and  Counter  Improvised Explosive  Device  training,  both  as  outlined  in  Army  Regulation 350-1,  are  no  longer  standalone  requirements  and  now  must  be incorporated into units' Mission Essential Task training as part of the operational environment. Eliminated nontraining requirements included audits of dining facility headcounts by company commanders;  publication  of  appointment  orders  for  corrosion monitors as an additional duty; and inspection of soldiers' personal vehicles prior to long weekends or holidays.

## Task Management Tool

During  the  previous  fiscal  year,  HQDA  activated  the  Task Management Tool (TMT), a collaborative management program. This system replaced paper-based forms for routing official tasks and actions that require senior management authorizations and signatures.  In  FY  2018,  TMT  was  expanded  across  the  Army, and  unit  staffs  were  provided  access  authorizations.  However,

this change did not achieve the goal of replacing the Department of the Army (DA) Form 5 routing packets, as adaptation to an automated system proved uneven across HQDA. The use of the TMT program did reduce initiation to completion rates by two weeks, eliminated missed due dates by nearly a third, and yielded cost savings.

## Information Management

In  FY  2018,  the  Army's  chief  information  officer/G-6  (CIO/ G-6)  implemented  several  modernization  efforts. The  CIO/G-6 is  taking  over  information  technology  support  services  for  all  of HQDA, providing its organizations with a single point of contact for informational technology support and improving cybersecurity. It is working with several Army commands to integrate and standardize computer networks and security throughout the service. As part of this effort, the Army will develop a global design framework for its classified  computer  system,  close  and  consolidate  data  centers  that manage information technology systems, and transition to improved systems and applications using cloud computing. A modernized Army Knowledge Online portal will provide improved services, information, and training to soldiers. The CIO/G-6 is preparing to launch a pilot system at Fort Gordon, Georgia, to consolidate administration of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command's classified and unclassified networks under U.S. Army Cyber Command, and is improving the inventory and management of licensed software used by the Army.

The  CIO/G-6  facilitated  several  improvements  in  information technology  in  FY  2018.  The  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  chief information  officer  expanded  username  and  password  access  to government information systems from nongovernment devices, allowing veterans, Army family members, Army students and recruits, and Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers to access DoD and Army  systems.  Soldiers  across  the  Army  now  have  better  options to  access  required  online  training.  Under  the  CIO/G-6's  guidance, 118 Army installations have adopted Joint Regional Security Stacks technology  to  protect  their  computer  systems.  Additional  Army installations and commands, including U.S. Army Reserve Command, are  transitioning  to  the  same  technology.  The  Headquarters  and Headquarters Company, 2d Security Force Assistance Brigade adopted special technology and equipment to improve communication and information exchanges with coalition partners, and the CIO/G-6 continues  to  design  technology  adaptable  to  the  varied  missions  of security force assistance brigades and other Army units.

In FY 2018, more than 3,200 Army civilians working in information technology  participated  in  training  and  education  to  enhance  their professional  skills.  However,  after  comprehensively  reviewing  Army networks to identify modernization and cybersecurity needs, the CIO/ G-6 recognized that the Army does not have sufficient information technology  talent  to  meet  its  goals  and  will  need  to  partner  with private  industry  to  improve  its  data  and  communications  networks. For example, the Army's Logistics Support Activity uses IBM Hybrid Cloud services to manage and secure millions of logistics information transactions per day.

From 25 April to 31 May 2018, the Army G-2 tested a Streamlined Screening and Vetting Pilot (S2VP) using advanced analytic methodologies to identify suitability, security, and counterintelligence concerns  regarding  military  accessions  with  foreign  preference  and foreign  influence  risks.  The  S2VP  used  the  screening  methodology employed  by  the  Pentagon  Force  Protection  Agency,  augmented by  National  Intelligence  Agency  checks  and  unique  intelligence community  databases. The S2VP  screened approximately 2,400 lawful permanent residents seeking to enter the Army, and assessed the  S2VP  process  as  more  effective  at  identifying  foreign  influence/ preference risks than current policy requirements. The S2VP identified approximately 1,400 applicants who successfully completed the vetting process and present low or negligible risk to the force. The G-2 provided a  'by  name'  list  of  these  individuals  and  their  S2VP  results  to  the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Facility to support an adjudicative decision. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) agreed to help assess the identified low-risk candidates by prioritizing their background investigations currently pending with the National Background Investigations Bureau and adjudication.

In August 2018, the Army G-2 met with the Defense Personnel and  Security  Research  Center  in  preparation  for  a  study  related  to the S2VP. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the S2VP relative to a Tier 3 background investigation. The center will  conduct  a  nine-month  study  using  a  sample  size  of  800  lawful permanent residents who were screened through the pilot program in early 2018. In December 2018, it will present an interim analysis on approximately 400 individuals in the sample. If the study validates the program, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) may use the results of S2VP to adjust foreign national screening and vetting policies.

During  FY  2018,  the  Army  continued  work  on  the  CASTLE KEEP  Special  Security  Office  (SSO)  pilot  tool.  The  tool,  when complete, will automate the outdated manual SSO processes for the

Sensitive Compartmented  Information  (SCI)  program.  CASTLE KEEP will serve as an SSO user interface portal to provide automated workflow services and SCI program reporting, metrics, analysis, and information sharing within the Army SCI community in accordance with  DoD  Manual  5105.21.  The  tool  will  be  hosted  on  the  Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication Systems, or JWICS, network and be cloud compliant, utilizing the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise. During FY 2018, the CASTLE KEEP application migrated from the Amazon Web Service GovCloud instantiation  into  the  Army  Commercial  Cloud  Service  Provider (AC2SP) Unclassified (UC2S) environment to support further testing and  application  maturation.  CASTLE  KEEP  is  the  first  Army tenant application to reside on the newly established AC2SP UC2S environment. Upon completion of initial testing on UC2S, CASTLE KEEP will migrate to the AC2SP Top Secret environment. Once initial migration  is  completed,  CASTLE  KEEP  will  continue  to  undergo testing. The Army will begin initial pilot fielding with the Army SSO community in FY 2019.

## Command Accountability and Execution Review Program

In  December  2017,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  established  the Command Accountability and Execution Review (CAER) program to  optimize  the  Army's  purchasing  power  and  enhance  prudent stewardship  of  its  financial  resources.  This  program  addressed  the recent trend of the service, deobligating an average of 3 to 5 percent of  its  annual  operations  and  maintenance  (O&amp;M)  accounts  every year-a loss of purchasing power that equates to billions of dollars. These deobligations occurred primarily in three areas: service contracts, supply chain management, and personnel and equipment transportation.  The  program  additionally  seeks  to  ensure  that  all O&amp;M funding  is  fully  executed  to  high-priority  requirements  that directly affect readiness and that the Army is reimbursed for services it provides other government agencies.

Under CAER, each Army command, Army service component command, and direct reporting unit provides to HQDA a monthly and a quarterly assessment of its O&amp;M funding execution. These reviews examine indicators of the organization's fiscal health, share best practices, and evaluate corrective actions taken to improve performance in the  areas  of  deobligation,  underexecution,  and  reimbursement.  The assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and comptroller) provided organizations with a CAER template to use in preparing these assessments.

The under secretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army chair a monthly review of submitted CAER assessments. Quarterly, the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army, with the participation of Army four-star leaders, chair a session that provides strategic-level  program guidance and direction. At the end of FY 2018, senior Army leaders evaluated the program as successful, as the service ended the year with its lowest unobligated end-of-year balance in four previous fiscal years.

## Audit

The DoD inspector general contracted with an independent public accounting firm for the first full audit of the Army's General Fund Financial Statements and related notes. The audit addressed several key questions, such as whether the Army accurately accounts for its property, whether it correctly pays its military and civilian personnel, whether it produces accurate financial transactions, and whether its

financial and property accountability financial systems are secure and reliable. During the audit process, the auditor made more than 5,000 requests to the Army for material, conducted 127 site visits, and tested approximately 18,000 sample items. The Army provided the auditor with tens of thousands of relevant documents.

The audit resulted in a disclaimer of opinion on the Army's FY 2018 General  Fund  Financial  Statements  and  related  notes.  This  finding means the auditor could not form a complete opinion on the financial statements because it could not obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  support  the  reported  amounts  within  the  financial  statements. In  its  report,  the  auditors  noted  twelve  material  weaknesses  related to Army financial reporting internal controls and three instances of noncompliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  The  assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and comptroller) had expected the firm to issue a disclaimer of opinion and concurred with its findings.

## HQDA Staff Action Time Standards and Procedures

By August 2018, the secretary of the Army concluded that he and other senior leaders (the under secretary, the chief of staff, and the vice chief of staff) in HQDA frequently received actions that would require their decisions with little or no time to review and deliberate the issues involved. Therefore, that month he instituted time  standards  for  various  staff  actions.  For  all  HQDA-initiated actions requiring a decision by him, the under secretary, the chief of staff, or the vice chief of staff, he directed staff to use the 2/31/3 rule. Under this rule, two-thirds of the time before the suspense date will be allotted for staff officers' work and one-third for senior leaders' review. All HQDA tasking agencies will set suspense dates in accordance with this rule. An exception to this rule is granted if the action's suspense is in less than thirty days. For these actions, one-half  of  the  time  will  go  to  the  staff  and  one-half  to  senior leaders. Furthermore, the secretary and the chief of staff must be notified immediately upon the initiation of actions with a suspense of less than thirty days.

For reports from HQDA to Congress requiring senior Army leader endorsement, the senior leaders' review period will be a minimum of thirty days. For any action that a senior leader returns, the office of primary responsibility  for  that  action  has  twenty-four  hours,  unless otherwise  stated,  to  make  the  directed  adjustments  and  update  the action  in  the  HQDA  TMT  system.  For  actions  received  from  the secretary  of  defense  or  the  deputy  secretary  of  defense,  regardless

of  suspense  date,  the  principal  official  handling  the  matter  will immediately inform the Army senior leaders' offices and the director of the Army Staff of the action upon its receipt.

The secretary expressed concern over processes for coordinating actions that reduced time for senior leaders' review. He directed HQDA offices not to overstaff an action with multiple layers inside one office. To maintain visibility, all actions are to be initiated only in TMT. A request for information from the secretary or the chief of staff will be answered within seventy-two hours of receipt. The secretary directed information paper requests not be answered with PowerPoint slides unless absolutely necessary.

## Budget

Congress  had  not  approved  an  FY  2018  budget  for  the  DoD by the end of FY 2017. Instead, for the ninth consecutive time, the Army began a new fiscal year funded by a continuing resolution. The absence of an approved budget continued for 173 days into FY 2018; during  this  period,  there  were  five  continuing  resolutions  and  two federal government shutdowns. Congress, acknowledging the budget challenges  presented  by  the  continuing  resolutions,  granted  a  onetime relief from Section 8004 limitations, known as the '80/20' rule, which states no more than 20 percent of funding may be obligated in the  final  two  months  of  the  year.  The  exemption  changed  the  ratio to  75/25.  Congress  also  raised  the  thresholds  for  reprogramming approval procedures from $15 million to $20 million between budget activities and the transfer of funds across nine Army readiness related requirements with only a thirty-day notification.

In February 2018, passage of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 2018 raised the spending limits for defense funding in FY 2018 and FY 2019 above the caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. On 23 March 2018, the president signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which included the Army's budget for FY 2018. Though it became law nearly six months into the fiscal year, this act provided the Army a budget of $176.4 billion, nearly 5 percent higher than the requested budget ( Table 1 ).

Military personnel appropriations were 99.7 executed by the end of FY 2018. The direct Army civilian pay full-time equivalent execution was 126,900 compared to a budgeted full-time equivalent of 129,900. This  difference  stemmed  from  the  use  of  continuing  resolutions to fund the service through the second quarter of the fiscal year, as organizations reacted to the fiscal uncertainty by hiring lower than the expected number of personnel during this period.

Source: Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and

Comptroller), FY 2018 President's Budget Highlights , May 2017

Between  99.5  percent  and  100  percent  of  O&amp;M  base  budget accounts  and  99.9  percent  of  the  overseas  contingency  operations (OCO) O&amp;M account had been obligated by the end of the fiscal year ( Table 2 ). In the FY 2018/2020 procurement appropriations, the Army had a 68.4 percent obligation rate against the 80 percent Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) goal in the first year of availability. Two factors contributed to the Army missing this first year goal: the delay in receiving appropriations until March 2018 and concentration on executing the FY 2017/2019 procurement appropriations. For those appropriations,  the  Army  exceeded  the  second  year  of  availability OSD obligation  goal  of  90  percent  with  a  92.5  percent  execution rate.  The  Army  executed  its  expiring-year  FY  2016  procurement program at 99.7 percent, with only $45 million unobligated across five procurement  appropriations. The  majority of unobligated funds  are  in  the  Missile  Procurement  and  the  Other  Procurement

appropriations  and  cover  the  contingent  liabilities  for  fixed-price incentive contracts pending Defense Contract Management Agency reconciliation ( Table 3 ).

The  Army  expended  35.2  percent  of  its  FY  2018  research, development,  test,  and  evaluation  appropriation  against  the  OSD goal  of  55  percent.  The  Army  executed  99.7  percent  and  obligated 84.1 percent of its expiring year FY 2017 research, development, test and evaluation program against the OSD goals of 100 percent and 90 percent, respectively. The remaining unobligated funds were retained to finance contract adjustments.

All twenty-six projects were awarded in the expiring FY 2014/2018 Military  Construction,  Army,  appropriation.  Unobligated  funds  in the amount of $1.6 million remain available for contract adjustments and claims through FY 2023. In the current FY 2018/2022 Military Construction,  Army,  appropriation,  twelve  of  thirty  projects  were awarded.  The  remaining  eighteen  projects  were  not  awarded  owing to environmental,  site, or solicitation issues, or prior approval reprogramming  requirements.  They  are  projected  to  be  awarded in  FY  2019.  Unobligated  funding  in  the  amount  of  $828.6  million remains available to award for remaining projects and their planning and design requirements, minor construction projects, contingencies, contract adjustments, claims, and congressional rescissions, as well as for reprogramming to other Active Army construction projects in the event of cost growth.

All  twenty  projects  were  awarded  in  the  expiring  FY  2014/2018 Military Construction, National Guard, appropriation. Unobligated funds  in  the  amount  of  $9.5  million  remain  available  for  contract adjustments and claims through FY 2023. In the current FY 2018/2022 appropriation,  thirteen  of  twenty-six  projects  were  awarded.  The remaining thirteen are special appropriation hurricane projects, projected  to  award  in  FY  2019/2022.  Ongoing  recovery  activities delayed the acquisition process for planning and design. Unobligated funding  in  the  amount  of  $592  million  remains  available  to  award for  remaining  projects  and  their  planning  and  design  requirements, minor construction projects, contingencies, contract adjustments, and claims, as well as for reprogramming to other Army National Guard construction projects in the event of cost growth.

All  eleven  projects  were  awarded  in  the  expiring  FY  2014/2018 Military  Construction,  Army  Reserve,  appropriation.  Unobligated funds  in  the  amount  of  $756,000  remain  available  for  contract adjustments and claims through FY 2023. In the current appropriation for FY  2018/2022,  three  of  five  projects  were  awarded.  Design completion  requirements  and  solicitation  issues  prevented  the  two

remaining projects from being awarded; they are scheduled for award in  FY  2019.  Unobligated  funding  in  the  amount  of  $85  million remains available to award for remaining projects and their planning and design requirements, minor construction projects, contingencies, contract  adjustments,  and  claims,  as  well  as  for  reprogramming  to other Army Reserve construction projects in the event of cost growth.

In  the  current  Family  Housing  Construction,  Army,  for  FY 2018/2022, one project was awarded at Camp Humphreys in Korea. Projects  at  Fort  Gordon,  Georgia,  and  Natick,  Massachusetts,  will be awarded in FY 2019. Two projects in Germany and a project at Kwajalein Atoll will be awarded in FY 2020. The Army fully obligated the FY 2018 appropriation for Army Family Housing, Operations.

The Army Working Capital Fund (AWCF) cash account in FY 2018  ended  with  a  balance  of  $2.059  billion,  $538.3  million  more than the FY 2018 beginning balance. The change in cash is a result of receiving $232.9 million in direct appropriations and a $305.4 million net increase in cash from operations. In the aggregate, the cash balance ended above the operating requirement. In FY 2019, Congress directed a $50 million cash reprogramming (reduction), but the AWCF is still positioned to support all known requirements. The AWCF's Industrial Operations  activity  received  new  orders  of  $4.8  billion,  generating $4.5 billion of revenue and $4.7 billion of expenses in FY 2018. New orders were $630.6 billion above plan and revenue was $127.1 billion below plan, with expenses ending the fiscal year $83.9 million under target. The end-of-year carryover was $700 million above plan. The AWCF's  Supply  Management  activity  experienced  an  increase  in customer orders, sales, and hardware contract authority obligations compared  to  FY  2017  because  of  increased  operational  tempo associated with home station training. The totals for customer orders were  $9.2  billion,  sales  exceeded  $8.7  billion,  credit  was  $2  billion, and obligations totaled $8.3 billion. Supply Management's inventory supported  122,000  separate  Army  managed  secondary  items  and received more than 776,000 supply requisitions in support of combat weapons systems.

In FY 2018, the Army submitted twenty reprogramming packages totaling  $3.5  billion  to  Congress,  a  6.5  percent  decrease  from  FY 2017. The approval rate for these requests was 91.9 percent. Of the twenty packages, nine were executed in September 2018. The uses of these  packages  included  converting  infantry  brigade  combat  teams (BCTs) to armored BCTs, providing transportation for equipment and supplies,  purchasing network enterprise licenses, improving network security,  enhancing  audit  readiness,  improving  gun  tube  production facilities, reestablishing the multiple launch rocket system production

supports a Regular Army of 487,500, an Army Reserve of 199,500, an  Army  National  Guard  of  343,500,  and  a  civilian  workforce  of 194,803 employees for direct hire in military function positions. The O&amp;M budget will enable the service to continue its focus on rebuilding readiness.  The  increase  in  research,  development,  and  acquisition funds,  as  part  of  the  Army's  modernization  strategy,  is  intended  to reverse the erosion in technological overmatch against likely opponents. The research, development, testing, and evaluation budget balances upgrades  to  existing  equipment  that  can  be  fielded  in  the  next  ten years with developing next-generation capabilities for the future fight. The  requested  military  construction  appropriations  will  target  the most critical facility needs for the active and the reserve components: replacement of aging facilities that directly support unit readiness such as ranges, training facilities, and maintenance facilities ( Table 5 ).

In the FY  2019  OCO  request,  military  personnel  accounts primarily  fund  mobilized  reserve  component  soldiers  and  active component  deployment  costs.  The  OCO  O&amp;M  request  supports Operation Freedom'S  Sentinel (Afghanistan);  Operation inHerent reSolve (targeted  operations  against  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  the Levant);  the european  deterrenCe  initiative ;  Operation Spartan SHield (the  regionally  aligned  forces  concept  with  partners  in  the Arabian  Gulf  region);  and  other  counterterrorism  operations.  The research,  development,  and  acquisition  accounts  fund  battle  losses, ammunition replenishment, and the enhancement of pre-positioned equipment stocks in Europe. The Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund builds  key  security  force  capabilities,  helps  professionalize  security forces,  and promotes long-term stability of the Middle East region. This account replaces the Iraq Train and Equip Fund and the Syria Train and Equip Fund ( Table 6 ).

In August 2018, the president signed the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, and for the first time in nine years the Army began the fiscal year operating on its approved budget instead of a continuing resolution.

## Personnel

## Army Strength and Distribution

When FY 2018 began, the Army expected to grow the force. Missed recruitment  goals,  a  backlog  of  pending  medical  separations,  and forced retirements because of retention control points, left the Army's end strength slightly lower than the previous year. As of 30 September 2018, the total force stood at 1,000,194 officers, enlisted personnel, and Military Academy cadets. The active component end strength totaled 476,179  personnel:  77,739  commissioned  officers;  14,260  warrant officers; 379,605 enlisted soldiers; and 4,575 military academy cadets. This  number  represented  99.9  percent  of  the  authorized  strength of  476,641.  Women  constituted  15.1  percent  of  the  total  active component, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 44.2 percent.

The  Army's  reserve  components'  numbers  declined  by  a  larger margin  than  the  Regular  Army's  in  FY  2018.  The  Army  National Guard  (ARNG)  end  strength  on  30  September  2018  was  335,204: 36,850  commissioned  officers;  8,675  warrant  officers;  and  289,679 enlisted soldiers. This was down from more than 343,000 the previous fiscal year. However, the FY 2018 tally was only slightly lower than the ARNG's authorized strength of 336,626. Women constituted 17.5 percent of the Guard's force total, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 31.3 percent. The Army Reserve (USAR) end strength on 30 September 2018 totaled 188,811 personnel: 34,348 commissioned officers;  3,542  warrant  officers;  and  150,921  enlisted  soldiers.  This was down from more than 194,000 soldiers in FY 17, and represented 96.6 percent of the USAR's authorized strength of 195,392. Women constituted 23.8 percent of the Army Reserve, and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 48.3 percent.

## Officers

The Army exceeded its accession goals for FY 2018, bringing in 10,982 new officers across the three components. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) accounted for the largest percentage of new officers with 5,332. Another 64 soldiers commissioned into the Army

Reserve through the ROTC education delay and early commissioning options. The United States Military Academy produced 986 second lieutenants.  At  the  Officer  Candidate  School  (OCS),  Fort  Benning, Georgia,  239  enlisted  soldiers  earned  a  commission  while  another 1,068 men and women utilized the college option OCS program. The Call to Active Duty program and interservice transfers brought 214 new officers into the Regular Army from the reserve components. The Army National Guard received 562 officers from OCS programs run by the states and 104 from the OCS at Fort Benning. Direct commissions produced another 2,581 officers across the three components, almost all  of  them  in  the  Army Medical Department, the Chaplain Corps, and the Judge Advocate General Corps.

The service launched the Army Cyber Direct Commission Pilot in late October 2017. The service identified fourteen areas with capability gaps in its cyber operations, ranging from software engineers to field operations  specialists.  Candidates  for  direct  commission  under  this program must be U.S. citizens under forty-one years of age, have at least a four-year college degree, be able to obtain a Top Secret security clearance,  and  meet  basic  fitness  standards  for  Army  service.  Once training  is  completed,  candidates  will  be  commissioned  as  a  first lieutenant and are eligible for up to $65,000 in student loan repayment over the course of their initial three-year term. Training consists of the six-week direct commissioning course at Fort Benning and the twelveweek Cyber Officer Basic Leadership course. In May 2018, the Army commissioned its first two officers under this program.

As part of the effort to increase its end strength, the Army for the first time began offering a bonus payment to college students joining ROTC.  The  $5,000  bonus  is  for  college  sophomores  who  are  not already cadets. To receive the bonus, they must complete the twentyeight day summer training program at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and sign their ROTC contract before the start of their junior year.

## Enlisted Personnel

The Regular Army missed its annual recruiting goal in FY 2018 for the first time in more than a decade. When the fiscal year began, the Army had a goal of bringing in 80,000 new recruits. Roughly halfway through the year, the goal dropped to 76,500 because of historically high retention rates. Despite the lowered objective, the Army still came up short of its mark, bringing in only 69,972 new soldiers. The Army National Guard and the Army Reserve also missed their recruiting objectives. The former brought in 34,629 new recruits versus the goal of  44,343,  while  the  latter  recruited  11,327  new  soldiers  versus  the

goal  of  15,600.  Several  factors  contributed  to  these  results.  A  low unemployment rate and expanded economic growth encouraged some potential recruits to pursue private sector employment. Additionally, studies  showed  that  less  than  30  percent  of  the  17-  to  24-year-old demographic  met  Army  standards  for  psychological,  mental,  and physical aptitude. Finally, U.S. Army Recruiting Command operated with  a  shortage  of  roughly  400  personnel.  These  factors,  when combined with a phone-based and predominantly rural approach to recruitment, contributed to the missed goal.

In  FY  2018,  the  Army  developed  new  incentives  designed  to encourage noncommissioned officers to volunteer for duty in security force assistance brigades. Instituted in 2016, the prerequisite requiring completion of the noncommissioned officer education system before promotion  was  suspended  for  soldiers  selected  for  promotion  who joined one of these brigades. Once they return from deployment with the brigade, they attend the necessary course. The lowest enlisted rank in  these  brigades  is  paygrade  E-5.  To  increase  the  available  pool  of soldiers  in  this  rank,  all  E-4s  selected  for  promotion  who  volunteer for these brigades promote to E-5 upon completion of the required training course.

In December 2017, the Army centralized the process for promotion to sergeant and staff sergeant. All soldiers eligible for promotion to these ranks are placed on a service-wide promotion recommendation list,  the  same  process  used  for  the  senior  noncommissioned officer ranks.

Previously, soldiers in the primary promotion zones for sergeant and staff  sergeant  required  their  unit  commander's  recommendation  for promotion. Under the new policy, all soldiers in the primary zone will be added to the E-5 or the E-6 centralized promotion recommendation list and go before a local promotion board. Appearance before a local promotion board is mandatory for all eligible soldiers. If a battalion commander  believes  a  soldier  should  not  appear  before  the  local board, they must explain in writing why the otherwise qualified soldier should not be promoted. Steps are then taken to counsel the affected soldier, up to and including separation from the Army. The intent of this  provision  is  to  afford  quality  soldiers  promotion  opportunities and, conversely, deny continued service to those who clearly do not show they have the potential for such service. The policy went into effect during the May 2018 promotion month.

## Civilian Personnel

At  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  civilian  workforce totaled  267,937  appropriated-fund  civilian  employees  and  27,336 nonappropriated-fund employees. Roughly 13,000 civilian employees are  foreign  nationals  who  were  directly  funded  by  the  U.S.  Army; other foreign national employees are indirectly funded by their host nation ( Table 7 ).

As in  the  previous  year,  Army  civilian  demographics  mirrored or exceeded the representation of the total U.S. labor force in three of  the  five  diversity  categories  (minority  status,  disability  status, and veteran status). During FY 2018, minorities accounted for 32 percent of the civilian workforce, veterans 50 percent, and disabled persons 11 percent. Females were underrepresented in relation to the total labor force at 36 percent of the Army's civilian population. The median age of Army civilians for FY 2018 was 49, down one year from the previous year, but still seven years higher than that of the U.S. labor force.

The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act had established several  direct  hire  authorities.  Throughout  FY  2018,  the  Army  saw a steady increase in the use of these authorities. As hiring managers and  civilian  personnel  specialists  became  more  familiar  with  the various  procedures,  commands  leveraged  these  authorities  to  target recruitment and minimize hiring lag-time in critical positions.

During  FY  2018,  the  Army  continued  transitioning  civilian employees into the Defense Performance Management and Appraisal Program. By the end of the fiscal year, nearly all Army employees were covered under the new system.

Two short-lived government shutdowns resulted in furloughs of civilian  employees  during  the  fiscal  year.  The  first  occurred  on  20 January 2018 due to a lapse in appropriations. This furlough ended two days later. A second funding gap occurred overnight on 9 February 2018. During this event, government services were minimally disrupted as the president signed a funding bill early the next day. Employees reported for duty that same day.

## Special Topics

During  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  worked  to  reduce  the  number of nondeployable soldiers in order to boost overall unit readiness. In 2015, the nondeployable rate stood at 15 percent. By the end of FY 2018, the rate reduced to under 7 percent. This reduction enabled the Army to move thousands of soldiers back into units, ensuring they were fully staffed and trained. This effort was related to a Department of  Defense  (DoD)  policy  released  in  February  2018  requiring  the administrative separation or retirement of service members who had been in a nondeployable status for twelve consecutive months, or twelve months  during  an  eighteen-month  span.  Soldiers  in  nondeployable status due to wounds received in combat who met the criteria for the Purple Heart, were the one exception to the policy. This policy went into effect on 1 October 2018.

In June 2016, the Army Talent Management Task Force began work on modernizing the Officer Personnel Management System, which had not  seen  comprehensive  reform  since  the  Defense  Officer  Personnel Management Act of 1980. Between June 2016 and December 2017, however, the task force did not have sufficient resources or authorities to complete its mission. Secretary Esper, early in FY 2018, made talent management one of his top priorities. After reinvigorating the task

force,  in  August 2018 he assigned it two objectives. First, develop a new  officer  and  noncommissioned  officer  personnel  management system  based  on  talent  management  principles,  private  sector  best practices, and examples from other armies. Second, develop and test talent initiatives. The task force is expected to have eighty personnel by the end of FY 2019. Its work will be aided by the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act enacted in August 2018. This legislation provides a number of authorities designed to help the DoD acquire, develop,  employ,  and  retain  talent.  These  authorities  include  brevet promotions, direct commission of persons with unique skills up to the grade of O-6, and permitting officers to opt out of promotion boards in order to complete certain types of broadening assignments.

The  Military  Accessions  Vital  to  National  Interest  (MA VNI) program,  implemented  in  2009,  allowed  immigrants  with  special language and cultural skills to enter military service in exchange for naturalization if they maintained honorable service. The Army has not accepted any new MAVNI applicants since 2016. During FY 2017, the service extended by one year the contracts of MA VNI recruits already in  the  Army  Reserve  Delayed  Entry  Program  but  who  had  not  yet shipped to their initial  entry  training  to  allow  time  for  additional  security vetting. In October 2017, the DoD made changes to the program that placed the highest emphasis on security and suitability screening. The department  made  these  changes  because  some  individuals  received citizenship  before  background  investigations  were  complete.  As  of April 2018, 1,100 MAVNI Army recruits awaited basic training while undergoing security reviews. A July 2018 media report stated upwards of  40  MAVNI recruits,  who  had  not  yet  shipped  for  training,  were evaluated as security threats and discharged or discharge procedures were  initiated  against  them.  Later  that  month  the  acting  assistant secretary of the Army (manpower and reserve affairs) directed the G-1 to suspend processing of all involuntary separation actions pertaining to members of the Delayed Entry Program and the Delayed Training Program  who  had  been  recruited  through  the  MAVNI  program. However, because of the increased vetting requirements and multiple class action lawsuits filed against the DoD by members of the MA VNI program,  the  Army,  during  the  remainder  of  FY  2018,  continued to work on the security protocols necessary to get these individuals shipped to initial military training.

In  October  2016,  the  secretary  of  the  Army,  in  accordance with DoD policy, had directed no otherwise qualified soldier may be involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment on the  basis  of  their  gender  identity.  In  June  2017,  the  secretary  of defense delayed the implementation of the accession of transgender

persons  and  directed  a  review  of  the  military  services'  readiness to begin such accessions. In August 2017, the president prohibited accession  of  transgender  persons  and  the  use  of  DoD  funds  for sex-reassignment  surgery.  In  September  2017,  the  secretary  of defense established a panel of experts charged with conducting a comprehensive review of military service by transgender individuals, focusing  on  military  readiness,  lethality,  and  unit  cohesion,  with due regard for budgetary constraints and consistent with applicable law.  In  February  2018,  based  on  the  findings  of  this  panel,  the secretary of defense recommended a new policy to the president, which was not implemented during FY 2018 because four federal district courts enjoined it.

Throughout FY 2018, the Army continued its phased launch of the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, which began in FY 2015. The first release interfaced with fifteen separate pay systems used across the Army and built the foundational database of trusted personnel  data  for  future  releases.  This  release  also  gave  soldiers access to the Soldier Record Brief, which will replace the Officer and Enlisted Record Briefs, Department of the Army (DA) Form 2-1, and nine multicomponent reports for human resources professionals. 'Release 1' began in FY 2015 and continued through FY 2018. By the end of FY 2018, soldiers in the Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve could view and retrieve their Soldier Record Brief, and  leaders  and  administrators  gained  access  to  nine  predefined queries on personnel records. 'Release 2' will go live in FY 2019.

The  FY  2016  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  directed implementation of a new blended military retirement system by 1 January 2018. This system replaced the traditional 'all or nothing' retirement  plan  for  service  members.  Under  it,  soldiers  who  enter service  after  1  January  2018  will  automatically  contribute  part of their pay to a Thrift Savings Plan. This guarantees that service members who do not serve a full twenty years in the military receive some  retirement  benefits.  Those  who  entered  the  service  prior  to 2018-but who had less than twelve years of service-can opt into the system by the end of that calendar year. Any soldier who does not opt in by 31 December 2018 will remain enrolled in the previous retirement system. By the end of FY 2018, the Army had the lowest percentage of enrollment of all the military services, with only 10.5 percent selecting the new system.

In  January  2018,  the  DoD,  acting  on  the  recommendation  of the commanding general, 82d Airborne Division, revised the rules regarding  parachute  duty  incentive  pay,  commonly  referred  to  as 'jump pay,' for the first time since 1950. Jump pay, which is $150 per

month, is automatically disbursed to those soldiers identified as being on jump status. Previously, to receive this pay, soldiers made at least one parachute jump every three months. Soldiers who did not meet this requirement, even if they made four or more total jumps during the year, were required to pay back the jump pay received during the three-month period in which they did not make a jump. During FY 2016,  780  soldiers  did  not  meet  the  three-month  requirement  and paid back a total of $535,962. Under the revised regulation, soldiers may keep this pay when circumstances, such as combat operations, other  deployments,  lack  of  aircraft,  or  absence  from  their  unit  to attend  military  training,  prevent  them  from  making  the  required number of jumps. For those at risk of losing pay, commanders in the grade of O-5 or above now have the option to waive the requirement for one of the three-month pay periods. The soldier must complete refresher training during the waived period to maintain proficiency.

The  appropriate  commander,  grade  O-7  or  above,  may  waive  the minimum jump requirement for soldiers who are unable to perform their required  jump  because  they  are  participating  in  combat operations  or  have  been  operationally  deployed.  Upon  returning from deployment, the paratrooper must complete airborne refresher training and jump within three months to maintain proficiency.

In January 2016, the secretary of defense directed a comprehensive review of all Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, and  Silver  Star  Medal  recommendations  from  the  wars  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan. This review ensured service members were appropriately recognized for their valor. The Army used a three-phased review process modeled after existing award boards. Of the 784 reviewed nominations, 23  were  recommended  for  upgrade  consideration:  10  Distinguished Service Crosses to Medals of Honor, and 13 Silver Stars to Distinguished Service Crosses. During FY 2018, the secretary of the Army approved twelve of the thirteen Silver Star upgrades to the Distinguished Service Cross. The president approved four of the Distinguished Service Cross upgrades to Medals of Honor. At the end of FY 2018, award ceremonies for the twelve Distinguished Service Crosses and four Medals of Honor were expected to occur during FY 2019.

The  FY  2017  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  directed  the review for Distinguished Service Crosses awarded during the Korean and  Vietnam  wars  to  Asian  Americans  and  Pacific  Islanders  to determine if the awards should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Human  Resources  Command  considered  thirty-five  awards  and recommended thirteen for upgrades. At the end of FY 2018, those recommendations were under review at various staffing levels within the Department of the Army.

## Medal of Honor

On 24 October 2017, the president awarded the Medal of Honor to retired Capt. Gary M. Rose for his action in September 1970 while serving as a sergeant with the 5th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces.

On 26 June 2018, the Medal of Honor was posthumously awarded to 1st Lt. Garlin M. Conner for his actions during January 1945 while serving  with  the  3d  Infantry  Division.  His  widow,  Pauline  Conner, accepted the Medal of Honor on his behalf.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Force  development  supports  Army  Campaign  Plan  objectives through  preparation  of  doctrine,  modernization  of  equipment,  and training programs. In FY 2018, the Army's efforts in this area reached an inflection point as previous years' investments began to bear fruit and challenges began to recede. This inflection reflected the continuity of focus on the service's top two priorities: readiness and modernization of the future force.

Articulation  of  these  priorities  took  the  form  of  a  new  'Army Vision' released in June 2018. It provided a concept for the future to ensure overmatch against all potential adversaries and remain capable of accomplishing future missions. The new Army Vision stated that the  Army of 2028 will be ready to deploy, fight, and win decisively against any adversary, anytime and anywhere, in a joint, multidomain, high-intensity  conflict,  while  simultaneously  deterring  others  and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare. Achieving these priorities  centered on readiness, modernization, talent management, institutional  reforms,  doctrinal  development,  and  continued  force structure action. The ways in which these priorities would be executed in the future was further detailed in The Army Strategy , with expected release in October 2018.

## Readiness

Readiness remained the Army leadership's top priority during the year. The service defined it as the ability of soldiers to fight and win decisively on any battlefield, against any adversary, at any time. During FY 2018, Army readiness trend lines improved over FY 2017. By the end of FY 2018, twenty-six brigade combat teams (BCT) and six combat aviation brigades were at the highest state of readiness, as compared to  nineteen  and  three,  respectively,  in  FY  2017.  Additionally,  nine BCTs were fully ready for combat by the end of FY 2018, compared to just three in February 2017. In September 2018, the service projected 66 percent of the Regular Army will reach its readiness goals within

four years and 33 percent of reserve component units will meet their readiness goals within two years.

Several initiatives  contributed  to  increased  readiness.  The  Army increased the number of training center rotations for reserve component units to four. Units also received additional training opportunities at home  station  through  the  Synthetic  Training  Environment,  which incorporates a variety of simulated training systems.

In July 2018, the service announced that beginning in late 2020 a new six-event Army Combat Fitness Test would replace the current three-event  Army  Physical  Fitness  Test,  introduced  in  1980.  The new  test  is  designed  to  ensure  soldiers  are  physically  and  mentally tough enough to meet the challenges of combat. It is also intended to help reduce preventable injuries, thereby reducing the number of nondeployable soldiers.

The  secretary  of  the  Army  reduced  the  time  soldiers  spent  on nonessential  training  as  part  of  a  larger  plan  to  cut  administrative requirements  that  distract  from  soldiers'  core  missions.  The  service consolidated,  reduced,  or  eliminated  dozens  of  required  activities, including  ending  the  requirement  that  soldiers  use  the  Travel  Risk Planning System before taking leave and use of reflective belts during physical fitness in dedicated exercise areas.

To better measure units' readiness, the Army began testing a new system, Objective Assessment of Training Proficiency (referred to as Objective T), as part of the Commander's Unit Status Report. This system establishes common readiness standards for similar units and establishes a framework to prioritize and protect unit training. Objective T is based on four foundational components: mission essential task proficiency, weapons system proficiency, collective fire task proficiency, and training days to achieve T-level 1 proficiency. To test the concept, Regular Army units began mock reporting against Objective T during the first quarter of FY 2018, in addition to reporting under the current system. Reserve component units with an assigned mission requiring deployment began mock reporting during the November 2017 cycle, with remaining reserve component units starting during the January 2018 cycle.

## Doctrine

To  achieve  the  readiness  to  fight  tomorrow  and  provide  the framework  for  modernization  efforts,  the  Army  continued  to develop  the  Multi-Domain  Battle  concept.  In  May  2018,  the Army  announced  that  the  term  'Multi-Domain  Battle'  would become 'Multi-Domain Operations.'  Army  leaders  felt  the  term

'operations' better captured the emerging complexities of modern conflict and the wide range of activities and places involved. The change  also  resulted  from  consultation  with  the  other  services who are pursuing similar strategies in recognition that future wars will require all services collaborating across all domains. Inspired by  the  AirLand  Battle  doctrine  of  the  1980s,  the  original  MultiDomain Battle concept was introduced in the 2016 Army Posture Statement. Early in 2017, the Army and the Marine Corps issued a joint white paper on Multi-Domain Battle. In October 2017, the Army released Multi-Domain Battle: Evolution of Combined Arms for  the  21st  Century,  2025-2040 .  This  document  sought  to  guide Army discussions and doctrinal developments. The updated version of  Field  Manual  3-0, Operations ,  released  in  October  2017,  also incorporated concepts of Multi-Domain Battle.

During  FY  2018,  the  Army  began  testing  its  Multi-Domain Operations doctrine through the establishment of the Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) pilot program. Under this program, 17th Field Artillery  Brigade  operated  as  the  MDTF  pilot  unit.  The  brigade experimented with a battalion-plus sized multi-domain element that maximized its flexibility and ability to work closely with air, sea, land, cyber,  and  space  assets.  One  of  the  key  capability  gaps  tested  was the countering of antiaccess/area denial systems, which could enable soldiers to create an opening in one domain that could be exploited by American assets in another domain. The brigade also tested the ability for  Army  land-based  artillery  to  sink  ships  at  sea.  As  the  MDTF pilot  unit,  the  brigade  rotated  through  the  Pacific  region  as  part  of the  Army's  Pacific  Pathways  program  and  tested  Multi-Domain Operations doctrine during the 2018 rim oF tHe paCiFiC exercises.

## Modernization and Future Force

In  FY  2018,  the  Army  established  six  modernization  priorities. First,  create  a  long-range  precision  fires  capability  to  restore  the service's dominance  in  range,  munitions,  and  target  acquisition. Second,  field  a  next  generation  combat  vehicle  to  ensure  combat formations can fight and win against any foe. Third, acquire vertical lift  attack,  lift,  and  reconnaissance  platforms  that  are  survivable  on current  and  future  battlefields.  Fourth,  upgrade  network  hardware, software, and infrastructure so they are useable in environments where the  electromagnetic  spectrum  is  denied  or  degraded.  Fifth,  develop air  and  missile  defense  capabilities  to  protect  combat  formations. Sixth, invest in soldier lethality that spans all fundamentals, including improved equipment and weapons for individuals as well as improved

training  and  simulations  that  model  future  battlefields,  including combat in megacities.

An Army Directive published in November 2016 provided guidance and procedures for Army open source intelligence (OSINT) activities in  accordance  with  Department  of  Defense  instructions.  OSINT is  intelligence  that  is  produced  from  publicly  available  information and is  collected,  exploited,  and  disseminated  in  a  timely  manner  to an  appropriate  audience  for  the  purpose  of  addressing  a  specific intelligence  requirement.  This  directive  applied  to  the  performance of OSINT research, collection, analysis, production, and training by intelligence  personnel  (military,  civilians,  and  contractors)  assigned, attached, detailed to, or supporting Army intelligence organizations with an authorized OSINT mission. This directive also applied to Army National Guard intelligence personnel when operating under Title 10 authorities. Among the topics covered by the directive were: who is authorized to conduct OSINT; conducting these activities in a manner that protects operational security; managing production requirements; the use of government devices; the use of social media; and conducting OSINT in a manner that ensures legality and propriety, and preserves and respects the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. persons.

In accordance with this directive, the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security  Command  established  the  Army  Open  Source  Intelligence Office  to  fulfill  its  responsibility  as  the  operational  proponent  for OSINT,  including  training  and  equipping  all  Army  OSINT  users. The office enables commanders to operationalize OSINT capabilities by providing advice and assistance; managing requirements for data and data sources; training and certifying intelligence professionals in OSINT; validating appropriate technologies; managing access to the DoD enterprise suite of OSINT tools and technology; and ensuring authorized  OSINT  activities  are  taking  place  in  accordance  with applicable law and policy.

During FY 2018, the deputy chief of staff, G-2, approved the Army Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) strategy. In FY 2017, senior SIGINT officers  recognized  that  this  capability  was  not  optimized  for  largescale combat operations against a peer threat after years of focusing on counterinsurgency operations. In October 2017, the deputy chief of staff, G-2, directed the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence to bring together SIGINT subject matter experts representing various organizations across all Army echelons in order to develop a unified, feasible, and long-term SIGINT strategy.

The new strategy increases the Army's ability to collect intelligence against peer adversaries and will provide a firm foundation for successful electronic warfare and cyber operations in a multidomain environment.

There are four lines of effort. The first is organizing and building the Army SIGINT force. The second is training, educating, and managing personnel. The third is equipping the force. The fourth is developing doctrine.  The  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-2,  directed  the  commanding general,  U.S.  Army  Intelligence  and  Security  Command,  to  lead  the SIGINT Community of Interest in implementing the strategy.

In  August 2018, the G-3/5/7 approved a new electronic warfare (EW) strategy for the Army in response to a new DoD EW strategy issued  in  FY  2017.  The  objective  is  to  operationalize  Army  EW capabilities as a force multiplier supporting ground commanders. The strategy  enables  the  paradigm  shift  to  cyberspace  electromagnetic activities by addressing EW capabilities and capacities. It has five areas of effort: building the workforce, operations, capability development, educating and training the force, and partnerships.

## Force Structure

During FY 2018, the Army continued to improve its force structure to  recover  from  previously  directed  force  structure  reductions.  The FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act raised the authorized strength of the Army to 1,026,500, an increase of 8,500. In addition, the  Program  Objective  Memorandum  for  Fiscal  Years  2020  /2024 supported the previously approved modest growth in several critical capabilities,  to  include  short-range  air  defense  battalions,  multiplelaunch rocket system battalions, logistics, and special operations.

During FY 2018, the total number of BCTs remained constant at fifty-eight, with thirty-one in the Regular Army and twenty-seven in the Army National Guard. However, making additional armored BCTs available for deployment to Europe and the Republic of Korea was  a  major  recommendation  of  the  National  Commission  on  the Future  of  the  Army's  final  report,  released  in  January  2016.  As  a result,  in  November  2016,  the  Army  announced  it  would  create  a fifteenth armored BCT by converting the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, from an infantry BCT to an armored BCT. The Army completed this conversion during FY 2018.

Provisions in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY 2019/2023 Program Objective Memorandum also allowed the Army to program a sixteenth armored BCT to be converted from an infantry BCT, for a total of eleven in the Regular Army and five in the Army National Guard. In September 2018, the Army announced that the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, would convert from a Stryker BCT to an armored BCT. Furthermore, the 2d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, located at Fort

Carson, Colorado, would convert from an infantry BCT to a Stryker BCT. These conversions were scheduled to begin in spring 2019 and spring  2020,  respectively.  Once  complete,  these  conversions  ensure a  more  balanced  distribution  between  the  Army's  light  and  heavy combat units. The thirty-one BCTs in the Regular Army will consist of eleven armored, thirteen infantry, and seven Stryker BCTs. In the Army National Guard, the mix of BCTs will stand at five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker.

During FY 2018, the Army continued working on activation of a  total  of  six  security  force  assistance  brigades  (SFABs),  five  in  the Regular Army and one in the Army National Guard. These brigades will  serve  as  the  Army's  first  permanent  unit  solely  dedicated  to advising and assisting partner nations in developing their security force capabilities. The brigades will also help preserve the Army's irregular warfare competency. In October 2017, the first SFAB activated at Fort Benning, Georgia, as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade. Headquarters, United States Army Security  Force  Assistance  Command, was organized at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in June 2018, with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2d Security Force Assistance Brigade, activated a month later  at  the  same  post.  At  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  Headquarters  and Headquarters Company,  3d  Security Force Assistance Brigade, activated in June 2018.

During FY 2018, the Readiness Enhancement Accounts authorized by the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, and created in all three  Army components, helped raise manning and readiness levels in  existing  combat  units.  These  accounts  provide  the  Army  with additional  notional  authorizations  in  specific  military  occupational specialty fields that can be recruited and resourced in order to protect against  hollow  formations  in  critical  units  (mostly  combat  units). In  particular,  the  accounts  proved  helpful  for  the  aforementioned conversions of existing BCTs. For example, they directed the Army to send more 19-Series armor recruits through initial entry training and qualification courses before their destination units began generating demands for soldiers with those skills. Thus, when the new armored BCTs stood up, a sufficient number of soldiers with the appropriate specialties were immediately available for assignment, rather than the typical wait time of more than a year.

In  FY  2018,  the  Bottom-Up  Review  of  military  intelligence concluded. In June 2016, the deputy chief of staff, G-2, in coordination with  Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  began  a  force  structure and  capabilities  review  of  military  intelligence.  The  review  assessed the  health  of  the  military  intelligence  branch,  the  capabilities  mix

between the intelligence disciplines and echelons, and the effectiveness of  current  designs  in  meeting  intelligence  requirements  of  ground commanders at all echelons in the year 2025 and beyond. The review concluded there are gaps in capabilities, capacity, technical ability and training at echelons from BCT to Army service component commands. The greatest risks exist in the organizational, materiel, and personnel domains and will require significant near- and long-term investment. Eight  major  and  eleven  minor  findings  will  be  addressed  through The Army Intelligence  Plan  2018-2028 .  The  most  significant  review finding, concerning the shortage of intelligence collection and analysis capability at the division and corps echelons, was validated and will compete  for  resources  in  the  ongoing  Total  Army  Analysis  21-25 process. Other capability gaps are being addressed through disciplinespecific deep dives that will result in validated operational strategies and action plans to address specific shortfalls.

## Stationing

During spring and summer 2018, the Army adopted procedural changes for major stationing decisions with a goal to optimize readiness, put the force in the best posture for global response, maximize current use of facilities, ensure cost-effectiveness, consider unique factors to meet specific unit requirements, and strengthen the Army's relationship with Congress and their local communities.

There  were  two  lines  of  effort.  First,  the  Army  incorporated metrics for public education, reciprocity of licensure, off-post housing, medical  capacity,  and  intergovernmental  support  agreements  in  the scoring  model  for  strategic  stationing  decisions.  This  is  in  addition to  the  military  value  analysis,  which  focuses  military  value  within installations.  The  inclusion  of  community  support  factors  in  the evaluation of stationing alternatives is in line with Army modernization aimed at building a campus environment between the installation and community partners. Second, the Army incorporated Congressional engagements throughout the decision process for actions concerning major  force  structure  to  ensure  Congress  has  visibility  during  the early development phases. This action recognizes the importance of sustaining a comprehensive, transparent process and communicating the intent of planned force structure changes with interested parties.

## Training

During  the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  focused  on  optimizing  its training resources, improving the quality of training assessments, and

enhancing the training, integration, and responsiveness of the reserve component in order to meet its goal: having 66 percent of its combat forces ready to meet war plan requirements between FY 2021 and FY 2023. This resulted in some shifts in the Army's training enterprise. Instead of predeployment mission rehearsal exercises, the capstone for unit training is now free-play exercises against an opposing force in a dynamic, combined-arms environment.

The Army began implementing the Sustainable Readiness Model (SRM) in FY 2017. It replaced the Army Force Generation Model and was fully implemented by the end of FY 2018. Under SRM there are no fixed, progressive cycles for Regular Army units, although reserve component units remain on a five-year cycle. The goal of SRM is to achieve two-thirds combat readiness for global contingencies for the Total Army by 2023 and provide greater flexibility in addressing the needs  of  combatant  commanders.  The  SRM  has  three  descriptive modules. The first is the Mission module, where units are validated, fully resourced, and available for or assigned to an ordered mission. The second is the Ready module, where units are achieving or sustaining a baseline level of readiness and can respond to contingencies. The third is  the  Prepare module, where units are rebuilding readiness and not allocated to missions.

During FY 2018, Army leaders used SRM to better shape unitlevel training opportunities. One result was increased and optimized BCT rotations to combat training centers. During the year, the Army conducted nineteen training center rotations. Nine were at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California, with seven Regular Army and two Army National Guard BCTs. Nine were at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana, with seven Regular Army and two Army National Guard BCTs. One Regular Army BCT trained at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany. Training during these rotations reflected the emphasis on preparing for a dynamic, combined-arms environment by including the opposing force's use of drones, degraded or denied cyber and electromagnetic environment,  chemical  attacks,  regularly  moving  command  posts, indirect fire, and realistic live fire exercises.

Early in FY 2018, the Army eliminated the position of platoon sergeant at advanced individual training (AIT) courses and replaced those  noncommissioned  officers  with  drill  sergeants.  This  change instills  greater  discipline  in  new  soldiers  by  providing  a  continuity of discipline as they complete the second phase of their initial entry training. Beginning in February 2018, qualified AIT platoon sergeants began attending a ten-day conversion course conducted by the Drill Sergeant  Academy,  Fort  Jackson,  South  Carolina.  The  conversion

course  takes  only  ten  days  because  all  noncommissioned  officers selected for AIT platoon sergeant duty completed the first six weeks of  the  drill  sergeant  course  before  beginning  their  assignment.  The conversion course will be discontinued once all qualified AIT platoon sergeants have completed the course and are awarded the drill sergeant designation. Thereafter, graduates of the drill sergeant course will be assigned to fill vacancies in AIT platoons.

The Army decided in FY 2018 to extend one-station unit training for  new  infantry  soldiers  from  fourteen  to  twenty-two  weeks. (During  one-station  unit  training,  recruits  stay  in  the  same  unit through basic combat training and advanced individual training.) The  additional  weeks  make  soldiers  more  proficient  before  they depart for their first duty assignment and increase their confidence in their abilities. The new program will include expanded weapons training, increased vehicle-platform familiarization, extensive combative training, a combat-lifesaver certification course, and an increased emphasis on drill and ceremony. The change also includes increased field training during both the daytime and nighttime in squad operations. A pilot class to evaluate the new program began in July 2018. After its completion in December 2018, the Infantry School will revise the program as needed and begin implementation sometime in FY 2019.

## Operational Forces

During FY 2018, Army units were active in a variety of global operations  and  engaged  in  security  assistance  missions  with multiple  foreign  partners.  In  April,  the  service  had  more  than 180,000 soldiers in more than 140 countries, supporting ten key named operations. Army troops also assisted with disaster relief and border security missions.

## Afghanistan

Operation Freedom'S  Sentinel in  Afghanistan  continued  to require significant Army support during FY 2018. American forces in  Afghanistan  have  two  missions:  counterterrorism  against  the remnants of al-Qaeda, and training, assisting, and advising Afghan security forces. Army casualties for this operation during FY 2018 were eleven deaths and ninety-nine wounded.

During FY 2018, the Army maintained elements of two division headquarters in Afghanistan. The 3d Infantry Division headquarters remained  in  country  until  April  2018  when  the  101st  Airborne

<!-- image -->

Division headquarters replaced it and assumed its mission of serving as  the  U.S.  Forces-Afghanistan's  National  Support  Element.  An element  of  the  36th  Infantry  Division  headquarters  (Texas  Army National  Guard),  which  had  served  as  the  Train,  Advise,  and Assist  Command-South,  was  replaced  by  an  element  of  the  40th Infantry Division headquarters (California Army National Guard) in December 2017. Responsibility for the Train, Assist, and Advise Command-South remained with the 40th Infantry Division during FY  2018,  when  a  second  headquarters  element  from  the  division arrived in Afghanistan in July 2018.

Five  augmented  BCTs  and  a  security  force  assistance  brigade served  in  Afghanistan  during  the  fiscal  year  to  provide  security force  assistance  to  Afghan  forces.  The  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team, 1st Armored Division, remained in Afghanistan until October 2017. The 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division, remained in Afghanistan until May 2018 when it was replaced by the 1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  4th  Infantry  Division.  The  1st  Brigade Combat Team, 82d Airborne Division, was succeeded in March 2018 by the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. In February 2018, the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade arrived in Afghanistan, making it the first such unit to deploy. The 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry

Regiment, from the 3d Infantry Division, accompanied the brigade to serve as its security force element.

## Southwest Asia

During FY 2018, the Army continued to play a prominent role in Iraq, Syria, and Kuwait. On 30 April 2018, the end of major combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Iraq was marked by the discontinuation of the Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command (CJFLCC). The most significant operations occurred in the continuing fight against ISIS as part of Operation inHerent reSolve .  Control  of  the  remaining  land  operations  was transferred to the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation inHerent reSolve (CJTF-OIR).  In  addition,  the  Army  maintained  forces focused  on  theaterwide  priorities  as  part  of  Operation Spartan SHield . Army casualties for FY 2018 in Operation inHerent reSolve were eleven deaths and eight wounded.

During  FY  2018,  coalition  forces  worked  with  local  partners to  eliminate  the  final  remnants  of  ISIS  still  present  in  Iraq  and Syria.  Operation inHerent reSolve ,  which  began  in  June  2014  in coordination with coalition and partner forces, aimed to defeat ISIS

in designated areas of Iraq and Syria and set conditions for follow-on operations to increase regional stability. The Army primarily provided command-and-control,  fires,  logistical  support,  and  security  force assistance. During a brief operation from 26 October to 3 November 2017, Iraqi Security Forces, supported by coalition assets, liberated the town of Al Qaim, a key border crossing with Syria and ISIS's final stronghold in Iraq. By 16 July 2018, Iraqi Security Forces and the Peshmerga (Kurdish security forces) cleared the final pockets of ISIS in Iraq from their safe havens in the Makhmour Mountains.

In Syria, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, with inHerent reSolve coalition  support,  completed  the  capture  of  ISIS's  socalled capital of Raqqa along the Euphrates River in Syria by 17 October 2017. After this, the Syrian forces and coalition focused on eliminating remnants of ISIS from Syria in a phased series of actions  under  the  codename  Operation roundup .  The  operation cleared ISIS from the town of Baghuz in northeastern Syria on 15 May 2018 and from al-Dashishah, Syria, on 20 July. As FY 2018 ended,  the  Syrian  Democratic  Forces,  with  coalition  support, were pursuing the last ISIS fighters in Syria located in the Middle Euphrates River Valley's Deir ez-Zor Province, close to the IraqSyria border.

During FY 2018, the Army maintained a corps headquarters, a division headquarters, and a BCT in the region to directly support Operation inHerent  reSolve . In September  2018, the XVIII Airborne Corps assumed authority of CJTF-OIR from III Corps. In  March  2018,  the  headquarters  of  the  1st  Armored  Division relinquished  command  of  the  CJFLCC  to  the  10th  Mountain Division  headquarters.  During  its  nine-month  tour  commanding CJFLCC, the division headquarters provided command and control of the coalition troops as they trained, advised, assisted, and provided critical capabilities to the Iraqi Security Forces. In September 2018, the division headquarters returned to Fort Drum, New York, after the CJFLCC mission was transferred to CJTF-OIR. In May 2018, the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, was replaced by the 3d Cavalry Regiment.

The  Army  also  maintained  a  division  headquarters  and  an armored  BCT  in  Kuwait  to  support  theaterwide  commitments  as part of Operation Spartan SHield . In March 2018, the headquarters of the 28th Infantry Division (Pennsylvania Army  National Guard)  deployed  to  Kuwait,  replacing  the  35th  Infantry  Division headquarters  (Kansas  Army  National  Guard).  The  3d  Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, passed off its role as the theater's armored BCT in November 2017 to the 2d Brigade Combat Team,

1st Armored Division. In addition to these forces, Army logistics and transportation units also served in Central Command areas.

## U.S. Army South

U.S. Army South is responsible for Army operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean. The personnel assigned to this command support security cooperation and contingency operations, and fulfill requirements for Title 10 support and combatant command support agent missions for the Department of the Army and the U.S. Southern Command.

Exercises in FY 2018 included: B eyond T He H orizon , P anamax , T radeWindS , FuerzaS aliadeS HumanitariuS , and medical readiness exercises. In addition, the National Guard's State Partnership Program involved eighteen U.S. states and twenty-eight  partner nations in the region. U.S. National Guard forces conducted numerous continental U.S.  engagements  as  part  of  a  security  cooperation  effort.  The missions of Joint Task Force-B ravo , stationed at Soto Cano Airbase, Honduras,  and  its  primary  unit,  the  1st  Battalion,  228th  Aviation Regiment, include providing helicopter support to counter organized crime,  medical  readiness  training,  and  disaster  relief  support.  Joint Task Force-G uantanamo is  supported  by  the  525th  Military  Police Battalion and rotational military police units from the Army National Guard and Army Reserve.

## U.S. Army Africa

U.S.  Army  Africa  works  to  build  capacity  throughout  the continent and support joint forces in order to disrupt transnational threats and  promote  regional stability. During  FY  2018,  the command and  its  aligned  units  participated  in  numerous  training exercises related to security cooperation; logistics and peacekeeping operations; and basic and advanced infantry training. These exercises included: J uStiFied A CCord , S Hared A CCord , U nited A CCord , and F lintloCk .  Units  also  served  tours  as  the  Combined  Joint  Task Force-H orn oF A FriCa and its East Africa Response Force, based at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti.

In August 2018, troops from the 10th Mountain Division completed a second train-and-equip mission for thirty-one soldiers from Somalia's Danab (Lightning) Advanced Infantry Battalion in the capital region of  Mogadishu.  The  fourteen-week  training  focused  on  building the  logistics  network  of  the  Somali  National  Army,  with  particular attention paid to instruction on basic preventative maintenance checks

and services. The mission built on the inaugural training conducted in May 2017 by the soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division.

In January 2016, U.S. Army Africa began planning to incorporate a  fulltime  theater  sustainment  capability.  Previously,  U.S.  Africa Command was the  only  combatant  command  without  an  assigned theater sustainment command. The U.S. Army Africa staff replicated the functions of a command through memorandums of agreement with the U.S. European Command and the 21st Sustainment Command. Therefore,  in  FY  2016,  the  Army  tapped  the  Army  Reserve's  79th Sustainment Command, a sustainment support command, to provide this regionally aligned logistics support. On 23 September 2017, the command officially transitioned to a theater sustainment command. During  FY  2018,  the  79th  Sustainment  Command  began  its  new mission, aided by the opening of new office space for the command's forward element at Caserma Del Din, Italy, on 11 May 2018.

In October 2017, four American soldiers were killed and two were wounded in western Niger. They were conducting a counterterrorist operation with partner Nigerien forces.

## Asia-Pacific

During  FY  2018,  to  deter  against  North  Korean  aggression, and  to  counter  China's  hegemonic  aspirations,  the  Army  stationed nearly 80,000 soldiers in the Asia-Pacific, with an additional 24,000 soldiers  deployed  there  in  rotational  armored  BCTs,  aviation  units, field artillery units, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense capabilities.

To  enhance  readiness,  U.S.  Army  Pacific  continued  the  Pacific Pathways  program.  Launched  in  2014,  Pacific  Pathways  combines multiple  preexisting  exercises  with  partner  nations  into  integrated operations. Each operation is a 'Pathway' for enhancing the readiness of  participating  forces,  strengthening  relationships  with  allies,  and providing a crisis response option for Pacific Command.

In FY 2018, Pacific Pathways consisted of three iterations. During the  first  iteration,  launched  in  February  2018,  the  Hawaii-based  2d Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, traveled to Thailand to  participate  in  the  C obra G old exercise.  They  later  headed  to South Korea for training, followed by the B alikatan exercise in the Philippines. The second phase, July to September, witnessed a first for the Army National Guard. The Indiana Army National Guard's 76th Infantry BCT served as the lead brigade for a task force that included the Regular Army's 16th Combat Aviation Brigade from Joint Base LewisMcChord, Washington, and the 10th Support Group from Okinawa.

This second iteration participated in the H amel exercise in Australia, K eriS S trike in  Malaysia,  G aruda S Hield in  Indonesia,  H anuman G uardian in  Thailand, U lCHi F reedom G uardian in  South Korea, and O rient S Hield in Japan. Some troops also participated in jungle training in Brunei. The third leg of Pacific Pathways was led by the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, which participated in T iger B alm and R im oF tHe P aCiFiC exercises in Hawaii, V aliant S Hield in the Pacific Ocean, and R iSing T Hunder in Japan.

In 2004, the United States and the Republic of Korea governments agreed to move all U.S. forces to garrisons south of the Han River, most  of  which  will  be  relocated  to  Camp  Humphreys,  about  forty miles south of Seoul on the peninsula's west coast. During FY 2018, the relocation effort continued with construction of new facilities at Camp  Humphreys.  United  States  Forces  Korea  officially  dedicated their new headquarters building at Camp Humphreys in June 2018. Preparations  continued  for  the  closure  of  Y ongsan  Garrison  and Camp Red Cloud. Units and headquarters' moves are expected to be completed during FY 2019.

The armored BCT rotation program begun in 2015 for South Korea continued. The 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, began

its nine-month rotation in February 2018. It replaced the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, which returned to Fort Hood.

## U.S. Army Europe

U.S.  Army Europe's Operation atlantiC reSolve demonstrates continued U.S. commitment to collective security. It reassures NATO allies  and  partners  of  America's  dedication  to  enduring  peace  and stability  in  the  region  following  Russia's  intervention  in  Ukraine. For the first time in fifteen years, the U.S. Army Europe conducted a brigade-level armored tactical road march on German roads as part of Exercise C ombined R eSolve X  in  April  and  May 2018. The goal of Combined reSolve is to prepare forces in Europe to work together to promote stability and security in the region. C ombined R eSolve X involved nearly 3,700 service members from thirteen allied and partner nations participating in exercises at the 7th Army Training Command's Grafenwoehr Training Area. It also served as the assessment exercise for the U.S. Army's Future Concepts and Capabilities, conducted by the U.S. Army Joint Modernization Command from Fort Bliss.

In  addition  to  units  permanently  stationed  in  Europe,  such  as the  2d  Cavalry  Regiment  and  the  173d  Airborne  Brigade  Combat Team, regionally aligned and rotational units also support U.S. Army Europe's  missions.  The  headquarters  of  the  4th  Infantry  Division supplied a mission command element to oversee the rotational units and provided a division-level command and control capability from February 2015 until February 2018. This mission was then assumed by  the  headquarters  of  the  1st  Infantry  Division.  The  Army  also continued rotating armored BCTs to Europe. During FY 2018, the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, served in Europe until June 2018 when it was replaced by the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division.

The 12th Combat Aviation Brigade is another unit permanently based in Germany, but during FY 2015 it was reorganized from a brigade with seven battalions to one with two battalions as part of the Aviation Restructuring Initiative. The Army, however, concluded in  FY  2016  that  Operation  A tlantiC R eSolve requires  additional aviation  support.  Therefore,  in  FY  2017,  it  began  deploying  a reinforced combat aviation brigade from the United States for a ninemonth rotation to Europe. In November 2017, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, completed the first such rotation. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, replaced it and in  June  2018  was  succeeded  by  the  Combat  Aviation  Brigade,  4th Infantry Division.

The  16th  Sustainment  Brigade  has  mission  command  over  the A tlantiC R eSolve sustainment task force. The task force is comprised of  Regular  Army  units  and  Army  Reserve  and  Army  National Guard units mobilized for a rotational tour in Europe. The task force supports the rotational combat brigades and other assets in the theater, providing  movement  control,  fuel,  water,  distribution,  ammunition, supply, maintenance, laundry, and postal support.

## Domestic Operations

During FY 2018, Army forces were deployed for relief and support operations  within  the  United  States.  Army  troops  from  all  three components assisted with relief efforts in response to natural disasters that struck the United States in late FY 2017 and during FY 2018, including Hurricanes Maria and Irma, and California wildfires.

## Reserve Components

Organizational Structure

The Army National Guard (ARNG) comprised roughly 39 percent of the Army's overall operational force-up from 34 percent in FY 2017. Structurally, the ARNG was divided into thirteen command and control headquarters: eight divisional, two expeditionary sustainment, and one each for air and missile defense, military police, and  theater  sustainment.  Additionally,  the  Guard  had  two  special forces groups, one security force assistance brigade (SFAB), twentyseven  brigade  combat  teams,  forty-two  multifunctional  support brigades, and fifty-six functional support brigades and groups.

The  Army  National  Guard  Directorate,  located  at  Arlington Hall, Virginia, reported  to the National  Guard  Bureau  and administered the ARNG's programs. The directorate consisted of the Office of the Director, ARNG, and the Army National Guard Readiness Center, which is a field operating agency of the National Guard  Bureau.  Additionally,  staff  from  the  Office  of  the  Chief, National Guard Bureau, provided support to the Army National Guard Directorate in areas such as public affairs, legislative liaison, and contracting.

The  U.S.  Army  Reserve  (USAR)  is  organized  under  a  single general  officer  with  staff  responsibilities  to  the  Department  of  the Army as  the  chief  of  Army  Reserve  and  command  authority  over most Army Reserve soldiers as the commander, U.S. Army Reserve Command  (USARC).  The  chief  of  Army  Reserve  is  the  principal advisor on Army Reserve matters to the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army. The Office of the Chief of Army Reserve plans, prepares, resources, and manages the force and is responsible for the justification, defense and execution of the personnel, operations and maintenance, and construction budgets. The commanding general of USARC leads the largest three-star command in the Army and is assigned to FORSCOM.

The Army Reserve consists of 2,075 units organized into seven geographic commands and twenty-two functional commands, overseen  by  USARC.  Reservists  comprise  78  percent  of  the  total

Army's  sustainment  capabilities,  providing  technical  and  industryspecific knowledge  and  expertise among  soldiers with fulltime, professional, civilian careers. Additionally, the Army Reserve supplies nearly 20 percent of the Army's organized units, almost half its total maneuver support, and a quarter of its mobilization base expansion capacity.  They also provide a significant percentage of personnel in psychological  operations,  civil  affairs,  petroleum  operations,  field service, mortuary affairs, and chemical units.

## Reserve Component Mobilizations

During  FY  2018,  21,497  soldiers  from  the  Army  National Guard were ordered into active federal service ( Table 8 ). In FY 2018, approximately 15,000 Army Reserve soldiers were ordered to active duty to support various operations ( Table 9 ).

## ARNG State Partnership Program

In  FY  2018,  the  ARNG  continued  to  provide  outreach  and training to other nation's forces, in Europe and around the world, through the State  Partnership  Program.  National  Guard  units  are linked directly with military units of U.S. allies to develop long-term relationships in accordance with U.S. foreign policy objectives. These units conduct regular military-to-military and interagency activities and participate in U.S. and ally-led exercises. Guard units took part

In  the  fiscal year,  there  were  seventy-seven  partnerships,  up from seventy-six in FY 2017, in eighty-one nations, covering all six geographic  combatant  commands.  During  the  year,  Guard  units worked with the militaries of more than thirty-two countries. These events included activities in both host countries and the United States.

## Hurricane Relief Operations

During  FY  2018,  the  ARNG  and  the  Army  Reserve  provided significant support  for  hurricane  relief  operations.  The  Atlantic hurricane  season  extends  across  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  and depending on the timing of a storm, Guard and Reserve relief efforts continue  into  the  following  fiscal  year.  Relief  efforts  for  Hurricane Maria began in FY 2017 and continued into FY 2018; and similarly, efforts for Hurricane Florence began in FY 2018 and extended into FY 2019.

On 20 September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico  as  a  Category  4  hurricane  and  caused  widespread  damage  to Puerto  Rico  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  The  location  of  this  strike required additional ARNG assets to be sent to the affected areas by ship or air. This-combined with nonoperational airports in the immediate aftermath of the storm, and ships forced to sail from the mainlandstretched  the  response  time  into  FY  2018.  More  than  2,800  ARNG soldiers from Puerto Rico and the mainland were on duty by the start of FY 2018. Several ARNG units continued to serve through October 2017 in order to support many Air National Guard units that ferried supplies or transported relief supplies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Hurricane  Florence  made  landfall  on  the  Carolina  coast  as  a Category  1  hurricane  on  14  September  and  quickly  slowed  down, causing  major  flooding  and  storm  damage.  All  three  components provided  troops  in  response,  with  strength  in  this  effort  peaking  at 14,000. The state of North Carolina activated more than 3,000 of its National Guard personnel. These were joined by Guard troops from twenty-nine other states and the District of Columbia.

During  FY  2018,  the  Army  Reserve-using  the  Immediate Response Authority established in the National Defense Authorization Act  of  2012-contributed  to  relief  operations  in  the  aftermath  of Hurricane  Maria.  More  than  2,000  soldiers  from  the  Puerto  Ricobased  1st  Mission  Support  Command  and  other  Reserve  units  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands responded to local and federal requests  for  assistance.  Placed  under  the  unified  command  of  an Army Reserve brigadier general, they conducted port-opening tasks, road  clearance  operations,  water  and  fuel  distribution,  and  water purification operations. Company D, 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power), provided a critical part of the relief operation by repairing power distribution lines. This company is the only Army unit comprised solely of linemen; it placed an average of ten power poles per day, and repaired more than 52,800 feet of distribution lines, connecting more than 3,500 houses and businesses to the power grid.

## Southern Border

On 5 April 2018, the secretary of defense established the Border Security Support Cell (BSSC) as the focal point and integrator for all requests for assistance, tasking, and information related to Department of  Defense  (DoD)  support  to  the  president's  April  4,  2018,  memo, 'Securing the Southern Border of the United States.' The BSSC is the  singular  interface  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security/ Customs and Border Protection regarding their requirements to secure the southern border. Furthermore, BSSC validates requirements and works  with  the  Joint  Staff.  Additionally,  the  Army  G-3  represents Army equities through the support cell.

In April 2018, the secretary of defense authorized the mobilization of up to 4,000 National Guard personnel to support the Department of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  southern  border  security  mission through  30  September  2018.  Operating  under  the  command  and control  of  their  respective  governors,  the  National  Guard's  efforts focused  on  aviation,  engineering,  surveillance,  communications, vehicle  maintenance,  and  logistical  support.  The  troops  did  not perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants or other individuals detained by DHS.

In total, approximately 2,100 National Guard  troops were dispatched  to  the  border  as  part  of  Operation guardian  Support , almost all of them from Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. In  June  2018,  the  governors  of  eleven  other  states  either  withdrew their National Guard contributions to the operation or canceled their agreement to deploy elements to the border. They took this step to protest the DHS policy of separating children from their families. In August 2018, the DoD authorized Operation guardian Support to continue through the end of FY 2019.

## Readiness

Efforts in the reserve components to improve readiness continued during  FY  2018.  The  Army  National  Guard  aimed  to  reduce  the amount  of  training  time  needed  upon  mobilization  by  select  units. To meet this need, the Army launched Army National Guard 4.0, a program requiring high-demand units, such as armored and Stryker BCTs,  to  receive  sixty-three  training  days  or  more,  culminating  in either a combat training center rotation or an overseas exercise.

Launched in 2016, the Army Reserve's Ready Force X program continued during FY 2018 with approximately 30 percent of units participating.  The  goal  of  Ready  Force  X  is  to  build  a  force  of selected  units  capable  of  deploying  on  short  notice,  rather  than building  readiness  for  predictable  overseas  rotations  as  had  been done for the past fifteen years. Units with high-demand capabilities are identified to create a pool of soldiers who can rapidly deploy, some  with  as  little  as  thirty  days'  notice.  Examples  of  these capabilities include petroleum distribution, rail operations, theaterlevel  engineer  and  aviation  operations,  civil  affairs,  medical,  and psychological operations.

In order to better train Ready Force X units and increase overall readiness,  the  Army  Reserve  continued  its  Operation  C old S teel , which had first been conducted in 2017. Operation C old S teel II took place in FY 2018 over eleven months with activities at five locations with more than three times the number of soldiers as the first exercise. The 84th Training Command, through Task Force Operation Cold Steel II, provided oversight of the operation. The 79th Sustainment Command led Task Force C oyote at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, from October to December 2017. The 416th Engineer led Task Force T riad at  Fort  McCoy,  Wisconsin,  from  February  to  May  2018. The  377th  Sustainment  Command  headed  Task  Force  B ullion at Fort  Knox from March to May 2018. U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological  Operations  Command  led  Task  Force  U ltimate and

conducted gunnery operations at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, from July to August 2018.

The Associated Units Pilot Program began in FY 2016. It is a threeyear test of a new concept to increase readiness and responsiveness of the Army as a total force. The program uses the secretary of the Army's authority to associate USAR and ARNG units with Regular Army units for training oversight prior to mobilization. When the secretary of the Army designates associated units, the association relationship modifies administrative control. The Regular Army unit commander is now responsible for approving the associated unit's training program, reviewing its readiness report, assessing its resource requirements, and confirming  collective  proficiency.  Association  also  helps  units  from different components train together.

In addition to training with Regular Army units, reserve component units selected for the pilot are provided with additional resources to sustain higher readiness. They have up to fifteen additional days of training  each  year,  and  more  frequent  rotations  at  combat  training centers or other capstone training events based on their type of unit. Regular  and  reserve  component  units  in  an  associated  relationship will be staffed to ensure sufficient available personnel to execute the

training  strategy,  exchange  assigned  personnel  to  enhance  mutual understanding across components, and wear common  patches. Associated  units  will  not  be  required  to  maintain  the  exact  same modernization levels, but must be compatible to ensure they can train and fight together.

In FY 2018, thirteen reserve component units and eleven Regular Army units from company through division level participated in the program  ( Table  10 ).  Forty-four  soldiers  participated  in  a  personnel exchange program between the units. Overall, the program has shown positive  results  and  training  readiness  improvements.  The results  of the program will be assessed in FY 2019, and a decision will be made as to whether it will continue.

## Innovation Command

In  January  2018,  the  Army  Reserve's  75th  Training  Command, headquartered  in  Houston,  Texas,  became  the  75th  Innovation Command. Previously,  it  conducted  mission  command  training  for unit commanders and staff prior to deployments. As an innovation command, its mission is to drive operational innovation, concepts, and capabilities to enhance the readiness and lethality of the future force

by leveraging the unique skills, agility, and private sector connectivity of  Army  Reserve  personnel.  The  command  is  in  direct  support  of Army Futures Command, although the details of that relationship are not yet determined.

## Initiatives

The expansion of equipment stores, housed either afloat or ashore, available  for  U.S.  forces  in  a  possible  conflict  was  a  major  logistics effort in FY 2018. These materials, designated as Army Pre-positioned Stocks, are under the control of U.S. Army Materiel Command, which is the executive agent for the program. It is responsible for the inventory management and equipment modernization planning, while the Army Sustainment Command is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and  deploying  the  items.  As  part  of  Operation  A tlantiC R eSolve the  Army  had  established  equipment  for  the  rotational  armored brigade combat team (BCT) to use in training, previously known as the  European Activity  Set  (EAS),  now  referred  to  as  the  European Enduring Equipment Set.

To better support a long-term deterrence presence in Europe, the Army expanded the EAS program from a set of training equipment to a full brigade inventory set named APS-2. The long-term plan for APS-2 involves acquiring equipment for a reduced-strength division by the end of FY 2020. The equipment was located at U.S. Army facilities in the Netherlands and Germany, with some items housed at temporary locations in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Lithuania. To improve the firepower of APS-2, expansion and upgrades of the equipment set include  new  elements:  a  Fires  Brigade  Division  Artillery,  a  division headquarters and headquarters battalion, a Multiple Launch Rocket System  battalion,  a  Paladin  self-propelled  artillery  battalion,  and a  High-Mobility  Artillery  Rocket  System  battalion.  Additionally, military police and engineer equipment was added to APS-2. Further enhancements  are  planned  to  include  a  sustainment  brigade  and medical units. Planning and funding will further develop and position a  second  armored  BCT  equipment  set  in  APS-2  by  the  end  of  FY 2020, which will be temporarily stored in Germany until maintenance facilities in Poland are completed in FY 2021.

In the Pacific, Army logisticians worked with Forces Command and  U.S.  Army  Pacific  to  support  emergency  deployment  readiness exercises. As part of these exercises, the Army planned and rehearsed

a rapid expeditionary deployment in the Indo-Pacific Theater. In  Northeast  Asia,  the  Army  Staff's  G-4  also  worked  to  develop the  APS-4  equipment  set  of  pre-positioned  material  by  improving the maintenance standards of pre-positioned vehicles at locations in South Korea and Japan.

During FY 2018, the Army Staff and Army Materiel Command worked to sustain the Army Organic Industrial Base (AOIB), a subset of the larger defense industrial base. The AOIB comprises resource providers, acquisition and sustainment planners, and manufacturing and maintenance performers. In 2018, the Army developed an updated ten-year plan to replace the 2012 AOIB Strategic Plan, focusing on revitalizing  the  AOIB  to  ensure  synchronization  with  the  service's readiness and modernization priorities.

Although the primary component of the overall defense industrial base  is  commercial  industry,  the  AOIB  also  comprises  Army-run maintenance depots, manufacturing arsenals, and ammunition plants, which are critical to the overall defense industrial base. The Army has five  depots  and  three  manufacturing  arsenals  to  enable  the  organic industrial base to meet a wide range of requests and challenges. The three manufacturing arsenals are the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas, the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, and the Watervliet Arsenal in New

York. The Watervliet Arsenal is the nation's only large bore cannon production facility and maintains processes for heat treating and rotary forging of large caliber guns. One of the key initiatives of the AOIB was an assessment to determine what production levels the facilities needed to maintain during a peacetime operation tempo, while still allowing them to expand quickly during national emergencies.

During FY 2018, several logistics related Army Regulations (AR) were revised. AR 702-19, Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability , was  released  in  May  2018.  Released  in  June  2018  were  AR  70-31, Standards  for  Technical  Reporting ; AR  70-57, Army  Technology Transfer ; AR  70-77, Program  Protection ; and  AR  700-142, Type Classification,  Material  Release,  Fielding  and  Transfer . AR  70-1, Army Acquisition Policy , was released in August 2018. Revision of AR 56-3, Management of Army Rail Equipment ,  and AR 525-93, Army Deployment and Redeployment , were not completed by the end of the fiscal year.

Logistics units worked to improve cost savings and efficiency, and the Army as a whole worked to enhance property accountability to meet congressionally mandated auditing requirements by FY 2018. As part of the ongoing restructuring of BCT strength to increase firepower and readiness, logisticians worked to improve property accountability at the brigade level. In FY 2018, the Army executed 198,000 lateral transfers, getting assets from where they were in excess to where they were needed. In addition, logisticians divested the Army of 475,000 excess pieces of equipment, worth more than $5.7 billion. Reducing the inventory of unneeded equipment saves the Army more than $17 million annually in storage costs. Divesture of equipment achieves two objectives: it frees up material for  units  with  unfulfilled  requirements,  which  negatively impacts their readiness; and it helps units with excesses to become more mobile and deployable. In FY 2018, divested equipment was used to help convert an infantry BCT to an armored BCT, and to equip the first security force assistance brigade.

The  authorized  stockage  list  are  items  specified  to  be  kept  onhand at the unit level. The Army is implementing a program to make its  BCTs capable of providing a full thirty days of repair parts in a combat environment. During FY 2018, all armored BCTs and infantry BCTs converted to a common core list that standardizes supply listings for the majority of unit equipment and enables better interoperability with pre-positioned stocks. In addition, the Army is working with the Defense Logistics Agency to have forty-five days of supplies at their forward stockage locations.

Army logistics organizations also worked to address an area of concern  among  deployed  and  forward  stationed  forces:  the  limited

stockpiles  of  'preferred  munitions,'  such  as  the  Patriot  and  the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, Hellfire missiles, and the Excalibur rounds and Precision Guidance Kits used for howitzers. Army logistics personnel worked to increase the preferred munitions inventory, ensuring the Army has enough to conduct two contingency operations  simultaneously.  Army  logisticians,  lawmakers,  and  the industrial  base  are  continuing  to  increase  production  and  provide additional funding for preferred munitions.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

In  FY  2018,  the  Army  continued  to  modernize  its  fleet  of ground vehicles through the introduction of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), a family of tactical wheeled vehicles and companion trailers.  The  JLTV  will  replace  the  Army's  fleet  of  High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, and offers better armor protection and mobility. The JLTV engine is rated for nearly 400 horsepower, more than double the horsepower of the High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, providing critical additional power in high-altitude areas  such  as  Afghanistan.  The  JLTV  is  also  built  on  a  V-shaped hull, which is designed to deflect the blast of explosions away from the crew cabin. In FY 2018, full-rate production began and initial fielding schedules were developed. The Army plans to begin fielding

the first JLTV-equipped units in 2019, with an approved acquisition objective of 54,599 vehicles.

Another  combat  system  under  development  is  the  Armored Multipurpose  Vehicle.  This  vehicle  replaces  the  M113  in  BCTs  in several roles: general purpose transport, command and control, mortar carrier, and medevac treatment. The first prototype was rolled out on 15 December 2016. During FY 2018, the contractor delivered enough vehicles for the Operational Test Command to begin its evaluations. Full-rate production is scheduled to begin in FY 2022.

The Army completed a major upgrade to the Stryker family of vehicles  in  FY  2018.  In  response  to  a  need  for  increased  firepower, a  total  of  eighty-three  Strykers  were  modified  with  a  new  turret containing  a  30-mm.  cannon.  These  vehicles,  the  Infantry  Carrier Vehicle Dragoon, provide increased armor penetrating capability for units without requiring a new vehicle chassis, which would complicate maintenance efforts.

In October 2017, the Army accepted the first six of the next iteration of the Abrams Main Battle Tank, M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3. The Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio, and the Anniston Army Depot in Anniston, Alabama, are producing the  tank.  The  System  Enhancement Package Version 3 replaces the previous version in production since 2005. The improvements include integration of the Joint Tactical Radio System: Handheld, Manpack,

and Small Form Fit radio; better power generation and distribution systems;  the  latest  version  of  the  AN/VLQ-12  Counter  Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare system; an  ammunition  data  link  for  programming  the  M829A4  Advanced Kinetic  Energy  and  the  Advanced  Multipurpose  rounds;  an  under armor auxiliary power unit; and upgraded armor.

Near  the  end  of  FY  2018,  the  Army  began  fielding  the  Squad Designated  Marksman  Rifle.  It  is  based  on  the  Heckler  and  Koch G28E-110  Compact  Semi-Automatic  Sniper  System.  The  new  rifle provides infantry, scout, and engineer squads with the capability to fill the 300- to 600-meter range gap outlined in the 2015 U.S. Army Small Arms  Capabilities-Based  Assessment.  The  rifle  is  capable  of  firing either M80A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds or XM1158 Advanced Armor Piercing Rounds.

The  Future  Vertical  Lift  acquisition  program-developing  a Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft as the successor to the UH-60 Blackhawk  helicopter-continues  to  progress,  with  two  helicopter prototypes under development. The goals of the program are to field a helicopter with a top speed in excess of 230 knots, the capability to operate at high (more than 6,000 feet) and hot (95 degree Fahrenheit) locations,  a  combat  radius  of  more  than  400  kilometers,  with  a payload of twelve troops or 4,000 pounds of cargo. The V-280 Valor features a tiltrotor design and flew for the first time on 18 June 2018. The  Bell-Sikorsky  Defiant  features  two  overhead  counterrotating propellers, with a 'pusher' propeller at the rear. Due to the complex nature of Army aviation systems, in particular the open architecture

software and lengthy flight testing, the program is not planned to reach a contract decision until the late 2020s.

The Army also devoted significant effort to develop an improved digital  computer  network  that  would  be  mobile,  secure  and  easy to operate. The service began fielding the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1 beginning in 2004 and an updated version, WIN-T Increment 2 in 2013. WIN-T Increment 3, a major system improvement, will incorporate advanced tactical network planning, management, monitoring, and defensive measures. Increment 3 is also designed with the flexibility to adapt to  future  developments  in  voice,  data,  internet  capabilities,  and will incorporate  line-of-sight  and  beyond-line-of-sight  satellite communications technology. WIN-T  Increment 3 underwent evaluations  beginning  in  October  2016.  The  test  series,  in  which combat units use the equipment during live exercises and provide the Army with feedback on its operation, was known as Network Integration Evaluation events. Due to evolving threats, the Army halted WIN-T Increment 3 procurement at the end of FY 2018 and is now seeking to develop a lighter, more adaptable system that is more suitable for high-intensity conflicts.

Additive manufacturing, such as the use of 3-D printers, is rapidly becoming a major part of Army logistics and supply operations. A new Center of Excellence for Additive and Advanced Manufacturing was established at the Rock Island Arsenal Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center. Army use of 3-D printers has advanced rapidly, and research is focused on making 3-D printing available for deployed units. The  Armament  Research,  Development  and  Engineering Center  at  Picatinny  Arsenal,  New  Jersey,  worked  to  create  a  rapid fabrication system for additive manufacturing that could operate 'on the battlefield' to create parts, specialty tools, and other critical items faster than using conventional supply channels. This system, the Rapid Fabrication via Additive Manufacturing on the Battlefield (R-FAB) consists  of  3-D  printers  inside  a  two-sided  expandable  shelter.  The shelter  protects  the  equipment  during  transportation  and  expands to  provide  a  climate-controlled  work  area.  In  FY  2018,  the  system demonstrated  manufacturing  capabilities  during  Pacific  Pathways exercises Hanuman guardian and orient  SHield .  The  Army  also made significant advances in using additive manufacturing to 'print' a  building,  with  a  computer-controlled  concrete  sprayer  depositing layers of concrete to form a barracks hut. Although still experimental, the  program  has  received  a  U.S.  patent  number  for  the  concrete mixture, and tests have demonstrated significantly reduced manpower requirements for construction of small buildings.

During FY 2018, a major improvement in sustaining the Army was accomplished through the fielding of the Global Combat Support System-Army  Wave  2  system.  The  Army  first  began  developing the system in 2003 using commercially available software to replace multiple information systems that order and track supplies, maintain accounts on equipment, and monitor unit maintenance. The Wave 1 system, which began fielding in February 2013, improved management by integrating the databases for warehouse inventory control, as well as supply room, motor pool, and property book offices. In Wave 2, the  system  is  further  enhanced,  and  all  users  are  able  to  operate  a single, integrated program, significantly improving transparency and accountability. In addition, the new update improves the visibility of assets being moved from depot, to warehouse, to troops in the field, enabling commanders to better synchronize their flow of resources to meet day-to-day requirements. Wave 2 also upgrades the audit features of the software, and links interfacing with the Army's General Fund Enterprise Business System, making it easier to track spending.

In September 2017, the Army awarded a contract to produce thirtysix  Maneuver  Support  Vessel-Light  (MSV-L)  landing  craft,  which replaces the Army fleet of landing craft dating back to the Vietnam War, and significantly improves logistics support and transportation capabilities. Each landing craft is roughly 100 feet in length and can carry one M1 Abrams tank or two Stryker armored vehicles. With a top speed of 18 knots, it is twice as fast at the LCM-8 it is replacing. In FY 2018, the MSV-L successfully met the initial program reviews and  test  requirements  to  authorize  the  production  of  the  full-scale prototype through FY 2019.

In July 2018, the Army terminated the XM25 Counter Defilade Target  Engagement  system.  The  XM25  began  development  in  the 1990s and was designed to produce a man-portable grenade launcher system that could fire 25-mm. grenades programmed to explode at a predetermined range. It was hoped this system would allow infantry forces  to  defeat  enemies  in  trenches  or  protected  by  barriers  to direct  fire.  The  system  was  tested  and  even  fielded  in  several  units in  Afghanistan, but the XM25 was heavy and had several notable malfunctions,  including  one  that  resulted  in  an  injury  to  the  firer. As part of the termination settlement with the XM25's developer, the Army retains the intellectual property rights to the system and related ammunition.

In FY 2018, the Army continued its Strategic Portfolio Analysis and Review (SPAR). It is led by the Office of Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4, in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, the G-8, program

executive  officers,  and  Army  Materiel  Command.  The  SPAR  is  a major review of interrelated weapons programs, or portfolios, and consolidates separate review efforts into a larger,  more  centralized program. Its goal is to assess Army capabilities over a twenty-year period  and  to  identify  investment  and  divestment  opportunities to  better  focus  and  prioritize  modernization  funding.  SPAR-21 focused on the modernization priorities for FY 2021 to FY 2034. In the shorter term, SPAR efforts will inform the 2019/2023 Program Objective Memorandum.

## Foreign Military Sales

The Army's Foreign Military Sales program is part of the Defense Security  Assistance  program,  which  transfers  defense  articles  and services  to  foreign  countries  and  international  organizations.  The program  supports  U.S.  foreign  policy  and  national  security  goals by  strengthening  bilateral  defense  relationships.  Among  the  Army's prominent  transactions  in  FY  2018  were  contracts  to  provide  the following: 64 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles to South Korea; 4  UH-60M  Black  Hawk  helicopters  to  Latvia;  180  self-propelled M109A5/A6 howitzers  to  Saudi  Arabia,  6,600  TOW  2B  antiarmor missiles to Saudi Arabia; upgrades for the AH-64 Apache helicopter for  the  Netherlands;  12  UH-1Y  helicopters  to  the  Czech  Republic; and numerous components for the Theater High Altitude Air Defense system for Saudi Arabia.

## 7 Support Services

Installation Management

The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) provides  policies,  programs,  and  resources  for  Army  installation services and  infrastructure.  U.S.  Army  Installation  Management Command handles the daily  operations  of  installations  around  the globe, overseeing multiple services to include fire departments, police, housing, and child care. In FY 2018, ACSIM initiated new plans and projects  to  improve  installation  management,  including  its  'RightSize  the  Installation  Footprint'  plan  to  consolidate  or  repurpose viable facilities, dispose of unneeded facilities, and reduce the number and cost of leased properties over the next ten years. ACSIM enacted improved  inventory  methods  for  nontactical  vehicles.  Additionally, it  is  standardizing cyber facilities and systems across multiple Army installations and enhancing cybersecurity. Following site assessments of Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, ACSIM is  revising  the  Army Mobilization Plan to improve the training and provision of resources needed to support major troop assemblages.

As part of its Installation Management Career Program, ACSIM published  a  training  and  professional  development  plan  for  Army civilians.  ACSIM  and  the  International  City-County  Management Association  launched  a  City  Management  Fellowship  Program  to enable partnerships between active component installations and local governments. ACSIM also established a training and development plan for  Army  civilian  housing  management  professionals  and  provided 212 training events for housing managers. Installation Management Command continued efforts to improve customer service by expanding training to employees at all installations and developing its customer service refresher curriculum.

In FY 2018, ACSIM sped up critical property maintenance and repair projects across the Army, using new authority to process seventy requests with a total cost of $1.44 billion. ACSIM implemented the same information technology system for all Army fire departments to standardize fire and emergency services information and data, and a new operation and maintenance program will extend the life of fire

trucks. The Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program secured  $35  million  for  FY  2019  to  improve  Army  installations' energy  and  water  systems.  Fort  Stewart  and  Fort  Knox  conducted controlled power outages to assess emergency management of critical infrastructure.  The  Army  Pollution  Prevention  Technology  Team continues  to  remove  hazardous  materials  from  the  Army  inventory. In FY 2018, the team eliminated carcinogens at Corpus Christi Army Depot.

Installation Management Command  hosted an Installation Innovation  Forum  in  San  Diego  to  promote  partnerships  between installations  and  surrounding  communities.  In  FY  2018,  the  Army saved $2.27 million through partnerships with state and local governments,  including  an  arrangement  for  Anniston  Army  Depot to accept excess soil from Jacksonville, Florida, offsetting the cost of purchasing soil. ACSIM transferred 1,527 acres of excess property to states and other entities and generated almost $36.7 million by leasing and selling property from closed or downsized installations.

The  Army  addressed  a  number  of  challenges  related  to  its installations  in  FY  2018.  To  address  inconsistent  communication with  Headquarters,  Department of the Army, following hurricanes, which affected Army installations, ACSIM and the Army Operations Center  implemented  standard  crisis  reporting  systems.  To  assist overseas installations supporting combat  operations, ACSIM  is developing new infrastructure and property management procedures. The Army continues to clear unexploded ordnance and environmental contaminants at closed or downsized installations to enable reuse of these properties.

## Housing, Construction, and Infrastructure

Eight  partners  of  the  Residential  Communities  Initiative,  the Army's  housing  privatization  program,  renovated  1,483  homes  and constructed  246  new  homes  for  Army  families.  Demolition  and consolidation of housing units reduced the Army's housing inventory by 631 units. The Privatization of Army Lodging program, begun in 2009, continued in FY 2018. By the end of the fiscal year, the Army's provider renovated a total of twenty-two hotels and built a total of eleven new hotels. At the close of FY 2018 there were four hotels under construction and one being renovated.

The  Army  Barracks  Management  Program  began  in  FY  2018. Its  purpose  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  soldiers  in  barracks and  increase  leaders'  accountability  for  daily  operations.  Under this program,  company  (or  equivalent)  leaders  oversee  barracks

management with support from brigade-level commands and garrisons. Barracks managers use Enterprise Military Housing, a new web-based application, to assign sleeping space and rooms to individual soldiers, track  furnishings,  and  schedule  inspections.  The  Army  Barracks Management Program will be fully implemented by July 2019.

The Office of the ACSIM is leading efforts to identify, mitigate, and eliminate potential hazards caused by lead-based paint in Army family  housing  built  before  1978.  For  FY  2018,  the  Army  included lead hazard testing in its family housing allocations for Europe, Korea, and Japan, in order to identify potential hazards caused by lead-based paint  in  family  housing  built  before  1978.  Following  media  reports in  August  2018  about  family  members  exposed  to  lead-based  paint hazards  in  Army  housing,  installations  adopted  enhanced  hazard screening  and  reporting  measures,  including  soil  and  water  testing. Garrison  commanders  held  town  hall  meetings  to  communicate hazard mitigation efforts to soldiers and their families.

During  FY  2018,  ACSIM  oversaw  several  major  multiyear infrastructure projects. Army safety management programs inspected bridges, dams, and railroad tracks on Army installations and worked to improve scheduling and funding of such inspections. After inspectors identified railroad tracks in inoperable condition at several contractor-operated installations, installation management personnel and engineers provided instructions for improving track  management  and  maintenance.  ACSIM  awarded  utilities privatization contracts for upgrades of electrical systems at Joint Base  Lewis-McChord,  and  Fort  Jackson;  natural  gas  at  Fort Riley, Kansas; and water and wastewater systems at Fort Leonard Wood. Additionally, the Hawaii Infrastructure Readiness Initiative oversees efforts to construct and upgrade critical infrastructure at Army  installations  across  Hawaii,  including  ammunition  storage replacement facilities at West Loch.

## Public Affairs

In  FY  2018,  the  Office  of  Army  Engagements  moved  from  the Office  of  the  Director  of  the  Army  Staff  to  Office  of  the  Chief  of Public Affairs and became the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs Operations  Division  with  responsibility  for  synchronizing  Army communication  across  the  service.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  chief of  Public  Affairs  sent  a  monthly  report  on  Army  senior  leaders' priorities for use  Army-wide.  Army  news  and  information  was shared on a variety of technology platforms, including the Army.mil Web site (21.8 million visitors) and its associated auxiliary sites, the

Army's Facebook page (4,703,406 likes, a 2.2 percent increase over FY 2017), the Army's Twitter account (1,285,848 followers, an 11 percent increase  over  FY  2017),  the  Army's  Instagram  account  (1,279,017 followers, a 43 percent increase), the Army's LinkedIn account (650,836 followers, an 11.6 percent increase), and the Army's Y ouTube account (which gained 19,700 subscribers).

Public  Affairs  arranged  fourteen  'Meet  Y our  Army'  events, bringing Army leaders to speak to the public and press in communities with little to no Army presence. They also arranged eighteen civic visits between  senior  Army  leaders  and  executives  of  veterans  and  other nongovernmental  organizations  to  build  relationships  and  sustain public  support.  Additionally,  Public  Affairs  organized  seven  Army Current  Operations  Tours  in  the  Washington,  D.C.,  area,  bringing together  unit  leaders  to  provide  comprehensive  information  about current operations to members of Congress and to other military and civilian  leaders.  Three  hundred  twenty-two  general  officers,  Senior Executive Service personnel, appointees, senior enlisted leaders, and  executive  spouses  participated  in  senior  leader  communication training sessions and learned about effective communication through the national media.

The  Army  communicated  four  key  messages  in  FY  2018:  the establishment  of  AFC  to  lead  the  Army's  modernization  efforts  and its headquarters location in Austin; approval of a new Army Combat Fitness  test  to  better  connect  fitness  with  combat  readiness  for  all soldiers; the establishment of security force assistance brigades (SFABs) to train and support the forces of allied and partner nations; and the Army's commitment to the safety of soldiers and their families, including provision of the best medical care and environmental hazard mitigation.

## Legislative Liaison

In FY 2018, the Office of the Chief, Army Legislative Liaison (OCLL), sought congressional support for Army initiatives including  the  establishment  of  AFC,  activation  of  the  sixteenth armored brigade combat team, and the creation of SFABs. OCLL emphasized the Army's need for SFABs to train and assist foreign partners,  allowing  existing  brigade  combat  teams  to  focus  on full-scale  combat  operations.  Congress  chose  not  to  place  legal restrictions  on  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  SFABs.  Instead, they  increased  scrutiny  and  questioning  about  plans  to  increase Army military and civilian personnel numbers in light of the Army's challenges in reaching FY 2018 growth targets. In response, OCLL leveraged  Army  senior  leaders,  advocating  for  funding  toward continued Army growth.

## Chaplain Corps

The  U.S.  Army  Chaplain  Corps  provides  religious  support  to the Army and facilitates soldiers' free exercise of religion. The Army Reserve provides about 81 percent of the Chaplain Corps personnel, with  the  Regular  Army  and  Army  National  Guard  providing  the remaining 19 percent.

In  FY 2018, addressing a ten-year chaplain recruiting shortage, the Office of the Chief of Chaplains implemented several recruiting initiatives, publishing guidance on recruiting plans through FY 2020 and introducing the Army-wide recruiting of directors of Religious Education. The Office of the Chief of Chaplains coordinated these efforts with U.S. Army Recruiting Command, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and the Chaplain Center and School. The Chief of Chaplains reinstated the Finders Keepers Program, allowing newly recruited  chaplains  to  serve  on  the  same  post  as  the  chaplain  who recruited them to the Army. A new Army Chaplain Web site increased viewer  activity  by  103  percent  over  the  previous  Web  site.  The  new

On 27 June 2018, senior chaplains join the New York Army National Guard for a wreath-laying ceremony in New York City honoring New York Army National Guard Chaplain Father Francis P . Duffy, recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, for his actions as a member of the National Guard's 165th Infantry in 1918.

Recruiting  and  Endorser  Relations  Directorate  participated  in  the National  Conference  on  Ministry  to  the  Armed  Forces.  Given  the decentralized nature of the Army National Guard recruiting efforts, the Chaplain Corps continues to face challenges recruiting chaplains for the National Guard.

The  Chaplain  Corps  training  and  leader  development  programs prioritized building spiritual readiness (resilience and character) among soldiers,  deepening  chaplains'  commitment  to  religious  and  military professionalism,  and  enhancing  unit  ministry  teams'  partnerships across the Regular Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard, and with

other military branches, coalitions, and allies in varied operations and environments.  Army  chaplains  participated  in  discussion  forums  on Chaplain Corps issues, and a council established under the Chaplain Corps Campaign Plan meets every six weeks. Chaplain Corps personnel account managers at the Pentagon took the first annual account manager training in order to coordinate personnel management and assignments with chaplain personnel managers in other parts of the Army. However, the Chaplain Corps struggles to provide enough training slots for all the chaplains who are required to take certain career training courses.

The Chaplain Corps continued its Strong Bonds Program, training soldiers and their family members in relationship skills and in meeting the challenges of Army family life. With a budget of $62 million for the  program,  chaplains  held  2,154  Strong  Bonds  events  for  48,747 soldiers  and  71,316  family  members.  The  Office  of  the  Chief  of Chaplains  trained  674  chaplains,  religious  affairs  specialists,  and noncommissioned officers to present Strong Bonds courses.

## Safety

In FY 2018, accidents caused 112 fatalities within the Army. This number includes twenty-seven on-duty fatalities and eighty-five off-duty fatalities. This total was nine fewer than in FY 2017. Class A accidents (resulting in at least $2 million of property damage, destruction of an Army aircraft, or a fatal or permanent total disability) decreased from 159 in FY 2017 to 142 in FY 2018.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy,  and  Environment)  identified  four  safety  and  occupational health  objectives  for  FY  2018:  improving  processes  to  identify  and correct  workplace  hazards;  streamlining  safety  and  occupational health policy, regulations, and pamphlets; developing an efficient and modernized information management system; and enhancing the Safety and Occupational Career Program through improved classification and qualification  standards  and  accredited  professional  certification.  In support of these objectives, the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center worked to eliminate duplicated or conflicting guidance in Army safety publications,  developed  an  upgraded  system  for  accident  reporting and tracking to be launched in 2019, and implemented new training programs for safety professionals.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  operated more  than  2,700  retail  facilities  around  the  world,  investing  all  of

its  earnings  back  into  military  communities  to  support  services  like fitness centers and child care. AAFES employed 35,000 people, more than 85 percent of whom had a military connection, including 6,000 military spouses and more than 1,200 wounded veterans hired since 2010.  Overseas  exchanges  thrived  in  FY  2018,  particularly  in  the Pacific  region.  Thirty-five  AAFES  Pacific  exchanges  returned  more than $11 million to Pacific military communities. In November 2017, AAFES opened a new $42.8 million, 300,000 square-foot exchange at Camp Humphreys, South Korea.

In FY 2018, AAFES launched a redesigned employment Web site, ApplyMyExchange.com, allowing people to apply for AAFES positions around the world. The Web site offers specialized application pages for veterans and military spouses. AAFES worked with the Army's Clothing Services Office to eliminate Army Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers'  difficulties  in  purchasing  the  new  Operational  Camouflage Pattern Army Combat uniform (required by all soldiers as of October 2019) by selling the uniforms online via ShopMyExchange.com.

In FY 2018, the Department of Defense asked Congress to pass legislation  expanding  AAFES  shopping  privileges  to  veterans  and DoD civilian employees. The deputy secretary of defense created a task force to develop a business case for the merger of AAFES, the Navy Exchange Service, the Marine Exchange, and the Defense Commissary Agency into a Defense Resale Enterprise and to begin standardizing business practices across these services. The outcome of these actions was not determined by the end of FY 2018.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Army Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) offers services to enhance the lives of soldiers, families, civilian employees, and military retirees. Services are delivered by 500 MWR headquarters personnel and  33,000 MWR  personnel  worldwide.  MWR  runs numerous facilities on Army posts including libraries, dining facilities, movie theaters, fitness centers, swimming pools, bowling alleys, golf courses, child care centers, and youth centers. MWR also provides a broad range of services including arts and crafts programs, vacation lodging,  outdoor  recreation  services,  concerts  and  entertainment, intramural sports and YMCA partnerships, youth sports and fitness programs, tutoring and educational support, parental education and babysitter training, child care fee assistance, automotive maintenance and training,  financial  services,  relocation  planning,  paperback  and audio book deliveries to deployed soldiers in remote locations, military survivor outreach, and employment assistance.

In August 2018, the Government Accountability Office reported that the fees for several DoD MWR programs were too expensive for military  families.  The  report  recommended  the  DoD  evaluate  and adjust  its  spending  for  these  programs  to  lower  costs  for  families. However, the report acknowledged that the Army had improved its MWR spending by covering at least 65 percent of the cost of these programs for FY 2017.

## Special Functions

The Surgeon General

The 2017 and 2019 National Defense Authorization Acts directed the transfer of funding and control of military medical facilities and selected medical support functions from the service branches to the Defense Health Agency (DHA). Congress intends to establish a single, integrated military healthcare system to improve the medical readiness of the armed forces and lower management costs for the military. The Surgeon  General  continues  to  be  responsible  for  setting  readiness requirements  and  ensuring  Army  medical  personnel  maintain  their clinical  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities.  The  Army  provides  medical assets  to  DHA.  In  turn,  DHA  ensures  staffing  at  Army  medical facilities is able to support operational requirements. In FY 2018, the Surgeon General began the reorganization and realignment of U.S. Army Medical Command to meet these requirements.

The  Army  will  execute  a  phased  transfer  of  administrative authority over its medical facilities from U.S. Army Medical Command to DHA. Designated Army medical facilities in the United States will be first to transition to DHA, followed by those located overseas. The first transfer of Fort Bragg's Womack Army Medical Center will occur early in FY 2019.

The secretary of the Army  directed the establishment of a Provisional Medical  Readiness  Command  to  assist  with  the transition of the healthcare delivery mission to DHA and support the establishment of Medical Readiness Directorates assigned to provide medical support to the Army. In FY 2020, the secretary of the Army will  conduct  a  performance  review  of  the  command  and  determine whether to retain, modify, or inactivate the organization.

In  FY  2018,  the  Army  changed  force  management  policy  for uniformed medical personnel assigned to Army  hospitals and provisionally  attached  to  operational  units  to  improve  readiness reporting and personnel accounting. In peacetime, most Army medical personnel serve in medical treatment facilities (MTF) providing care to soldiers and families. In a time of war, or to meet operational demands, the  Army  transfers  designated  medical  specialists  from  MTFs  to

identified  deployed  units  under  the  Professional  Filler  System.  This program  provides  the  assignment  flexibility  necessary  to  make  the most effective use of these medical specialists.

Prior to FY 2018, the Army accounted for these soldiers using the tables of distribution and allowances of their assigned facilities or  organizations  instead  of  the  modified  tables  of  organization and equipment of the operational units they would support under the  Professional  Filler  System.  This  personnel  accounting  method placed too much emphasis on the positions these soldiers occupied in  Army  MTFs  and  reduced  the  visibility  of  potential  shortages of  deployable  medical  personnel,  complicating  the  Army's  ability to  anticipate  and  satisfy  operational  requirements.  To  correct  this, Army senior  leaders  directed  force  managers  to  account  for  these soldiers  on  the  modified  tables  of  organization  and  equipment  of the units they were provisionally attached to under the Professional Filler  System  instead  of  the  tables  of  distribution  and  allowances of the MTFs they staffed. These soldiers will be attached to Army hospitals and care facilities but assigned to the operational units they are designated to support.

## Army Audit Agency

In FY 2018, the Army Audit Agency organized the majority of its workforce into sixteen functional audit teams. The agency also had a  professional  support  staff  directorate  that  provided  information technology, workforce management, and resource management support.  Approximately  sixty  employees  worked  at  the  agency's operations  center  at  Fort  Belvoir,  Virginia,  and  the  Pentagon.  The remaining employees staffed sixteen field offices; thirteen inside, and three outside the continental United States.

The agency conducts audits on selected programs, organizations, and issues of interest to Army senior leaders as a part of the Army's FY 2018 Internal Audit Plan. In FY 2018, the agency published eighty-eight reports with  $739  million  in potential monetary benefits  and  made  more  than  300  recommendations  to  improve Army operations.

During FY  2018, the agency continued to implement its FY 2017/2021 strategic plan. It increased its data analytics capability by investing in data mining and auditing software. The auditor general created process action teams to review: auditor competency, reporting practices,  plans  to  use  advanced  information  technology  to  create virtual workspaces, and advanced cybertraining programs. The agency also formed an Investment Review Board to assist senior leaders in assigning resources to support mission-critical tasks.

## Army National Military Cemeteries

The  Army  National  Military  Cemeteries  (ANMC)  provides oversight  and  expertise  for  the  Army's  forty-one  cemeteries  and Arlington  National  Cemetery  (ANC).  In  FY  2018,  the  ANMC employed five  Department  of  the  Army  civilian  employees  and  ten uniformed military personnel. The ANC employed 176 Department of the Army civilians and 28 military personnel.

On 13 March 2017, the president issued Executive Order 13781. It directed the Office of Management and Budget to propose measures to  improve  the  performance  of  the  executive  branch  through  the elimination  of  unnecessary  agencies  and  redundant  functions.  In June  2018,  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  published  the Government Reform and Reorganization Plan. As a part of this plan, they recommend the transfer of select military and veterans cemeteries located  on  Department  of  Defense  installations  to  the  Veterans Affairs-National Cemetery Administration (VA-NCA). In September, the Army and VA-NCA established a letter of intent to transfer eleven

Army post cemeteries to VA-NCA in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's plan.

During  FY  2018,  ANMC  continued  to  use  information  and imagery technology to make Army cemeteries more accessible to the public  and  improve  interment  process  accountability.  The  ANMC Mapper Project collected aerial imagery and geographic information system  data  for  ten  Army  cemeteries  in  support  of  the  ANMC Gravesite Explorer System. This application allows the public to query the ANMC database to access the location, images, and decedent data of a gravesite. The ANMC and ANC also continued development of the Enterprise Interment Scheduling System, an automated workflow application  that  tracks  the  internment  process,  from  burial  request to final delivery of interment services. The system improves records management  and  accountability  by  recording  all  information  and supporting documentation required for eligibility determination and interment processing.

During FY 2018, ANC scheduled 7,020 services, with an average of thirty-three calls per day for scheduling requests, and conducted 6,476 burials along with two interments at the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National  Cemetery.  In  addition  to  burial  services,  ANC  conducted

44 full honor ceremonies and more than 3,100 public wreath laying ceremonies,  as  well  as  270  other  events  including  the  traditional Memorial Day and Veterans Day commemorations.

## Civil Works

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) conducts the Army's civil  works  program.  The  program  has  three  missions:  maintaining navigation  along  our  national  waterways  and  harbors,  flood  risk management, and ecosystem restoration and environmental protection. Approximately  23,000  civilian  employees  work  to  support  the  civil works  program.  The  Corps  operates  and  maintains  12,000  miles  of inland  and  intercoastal  waterways;  13,000  miles  of  coastal  and  deep draft navigation channels; 196 lock and dam sites; and is responsible for harbors and waterways in forty states. The Corps is also responsible for maintaining 383 major lakes and reservoirs, and more than 8,500 miles of  levees  and  dikes.  Additionally,  the  Corps  conducts  comprehensive ecosystem restoration, regulation, and compliance programs.

In  FY  2018,  USACE  worked  on  dozens  of  major  projects  and maintenance  efforts.  Notable  navigations  projects  included:  Boston Harbor  deep  draft  improvements;  harbor  expansion  in  Savannah, Georgia; and continued improvements and maintenance of the Olmsted

Locks and Dam on the Ohio River. The Corps also executed significant flood and coastal storm damage projects along the Sacramento River, American River, and Santa Anna River in California, and the Raritan River Basin/Green Brook sub-basin in New Jersey.

## Environmental Protection

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy, and Environment) completed the process to revise the Army's procedures for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act at  32  Code  of  Federal  Regulation  Part  651, Environmental Analysis of  Army  Actions . The  revision  significantly  expands  the  Army's categorical  exclusion  to  reduce  the  act's  costs  and  timelines  while ensuring protection of the environment. The next phase for the revised regulation is the Federal Register publication process.

In  FY  2018,  the  Army  spent  $259  million  for  environmental restoration at active installations and installations closed by the Base Realignment and Closure process. The service continued its progress toward  meeting  the  DoD  goal  of  achieving  'response  complete' status-a site remedy approved, constructed, and maintained-at 95

percent of sites by the end of FY 2021. In FY 2018, the Army also began an investigation to discover and characterize potential locations where perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid were released on Army installations.

## Energy

During FY 2018, the Army continued its efforts to improve the energy and water resilience of its installations in accordance with Army Directive  2017-07  (Installation  Energy  and  Water  Security  Policy), issued in FY 2017. The directive prioritized energy and water security with  the  objective  that  installations  are  capable  of  sustaining  their critical  missions  for  a  minimum  of  fourteen  days  after  interruption of off-site sources. The Office of Energy Initiatives (OEI) is focused on  creating  'islandable'  capability-energy  security  projects  that include  onsite  generation,  storage,  and  controls.  As  of  the  end  of FY 2018, OEI's  project  pipeline  contained  twenty-seven  projects  at eighteen installations, with projects at fourteen of these installations conceived to provide 'islandable' capability, providing power in the event of a grid outage. The OEI's eleven operational projects have a total production capacity of more than 325 megawatts.

During  FY  2018,  OEI's  significant  accomplishments  included the  successful  completion  of  two  projects  at  Redstone  Arsenal, Alabama, and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. In May 2018, the Army activated a 50-megawatt multifuel power generation plant at Schofield Barracks. The plant is located above the tsunami strike zone and is capable of providing Schofield Barracks, Field Station Kunia, Wheeler Army Airfield, and the local community with secure, resilient energy generation during emergencies. In December 2017, the Army completed installation of a 10-megawatt solar array coupled with a battery energy storage system at Redstone Arsenal. This array is compatible with a potential future microgrid to further enhance energy security. This is the first Army project to incorporate large-scale battery energy storage.

In  response to new requirements from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Army issued new guidance for completion of installation  energy  and  water  plans  in  July  2018.  While  this  effort originated from a requirement from the Office of the Secretary of Defense for installation planning, the service took this as an opportunity to streamline installation energy and water planning requirements. Currently, installations are required to complete four plans related to energy and water management. This initiative will replace these requirements with a single comprehensive and integrated plan. The initial  plans  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  between  FY  2019

and FY 2021. Future plans will be coordinated and updated in accordance with an installation's master plan.

## Provost Marshal General

Following a successful series of pilots and a thorough accreditation process, in April 2018 the Joint Analytic Real-time Virtual Information Sharing System (JARVISS) received the authority to operate, which permits it to secure Army information and operate as a .mil Web site. The system provides open source threat information in near real time and allows users to report and update incidents as they occur. It will enable  commanders  and  Army  antiterrorism  personnel  to  improve their situational awareness of an event and make effective risk-based decisions. The Office of the Provost Marshal General began fielding the system in May of 2018 after completing command-level program manager and administrator training. Fielding will be completed Armywide by the end of FY 2019.

Development of the Army Law Enforcement Compliance Program and  the  supporting  Automated  Assessment  Tool  concluded  in  FY 2018 and then proceeded to fielding. The program enables Army law enforcement leadership to use objective performance data-through internal and external assessments-to help ensure continuous quality improvement  while  identifying  requirements  and  shaping  resource allocation.

The Office  of  the  Provost  Marshal  General  initiated  a  criminal justice  information  reporting  working  group  to  identify  and  rectify gaps in the Army's policy, resourcing, and reporting to the National Crime Information Center and National Instant Background Check System databases. The objective of this effort is to ensure unauthorized persons  are  prohibited  from  purchasing  a  firearm,  and  ensure  the timely and accurate submission of criminal record data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation databases. The working group identified two legislative  proposals:  one  would  add  Army  deserters  to  the  list  of persons prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm, and the other would create a separate enumerated article under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for domestic violence incidents. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2019 added Article 128b (Domestic Violence) to the UCMJ, which will be effective 1 January 2019.

During FY 2018, 464 deserters were returned to military control and 433 new warrants were entered into the National Crime Information Center. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 1,090 active warrants for deserters. Seventeen of those were Priority 1 fugitives and remain

on  the  Army's  Most  Wanted  Fugitive  list.  Four  escaped  prisoner/ parole violators were apprehended.

## Legal

In FY 2018, there were approximately 1,886 judge advocates (JAs) on active duty; 2,632 JAs in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard; and 692 civilian attorneys subject to the qualifying authority of the Judge Advocate General (TJAG). Judge Advocate General Corps (JAGC) personnel supported more than 600 legal offices and deployed task forces in more than thirty countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Egypt, Honduras, Korea, Kosovo, and a number of countries on the African continent. Diversity in the JAGC continued to increase, with women accounting for nearly 28 percent of all active duty JAs. Minority officers served in the JAGC at a rate higher than the national average of minority practicing attorneys, comprising almost 20 percent of the JAGC's active duty attorney strength.

During  FY  2018,  the  JAGC  prepared  for  the  January  2019 implementation of the Military Justice Act of 2016. The act directed significant  changes  to  the  UCMJ,  making  structural  alterations  that align  the  courts-martial  process  more  closely  with  those  of  federal district courts.  TJAG directed the creation of military justice legislation training teams to develop and present a course of instruction to update the  members  of  the  corps  on  these  directed  changes  to  the  UCMJ. Throughout  FY  2018,  the  teams  conducted  an  aggressive  training program to ensure the Army is prepared to administer these reforms. The JAGC also coordinated these pending legal and administrative changes with law enforcement agencies, the Army Corrections Command, the Department of Justice, and other organizations in the DoD.

In  April  2018,  the  JAGC  updated  and  published The  Advocacy Trainer , a  training  manual  for  military  justice  practitioners.  The manual was expanded to include new chapters on Theory and Theme , Hearsay , and Trial Visuals . The trial scenarios provided in the manual are intended to assist installation offices in building training plans that complement the JAGC institutional training program.

In September 2018, the Judge Advocate General signed an updated version of the 'Law of War Compliance: Administrative Investigation and  Criminal  Law  Supplement.'  This  document  emphasized  the importance of conducting thorough and relevant investigations into alleged Law of Armed Conflict violations. TJAG asserted the UCMJ and the Law of War were complimentary, and thorough investigation and  the  resolution  of  necessary  administrative  or  criminal  action demonstrated the Army's commitment to the rule of law.

At the end of FY 2018, the Army had 545 pending courts-martial cases, 226 of which were referred for trial by courts-martial, with the remainder pending disposition. Data on cases completed in FY 2018 is provided in Tables 11 through 16.

U.S. Army Report on Military Justice for Fiscal Year 2018

## 9 Conclusion

In  fiscal  year  2018,  the  Army's  highest  priorities  were  readiness and modernization, as expressed by the Army Vision released in June 2018.  These  priorities  coexisted  with  a  continuing  high  demand  for Army forces to conduct combat operations, provide deterrence, test new concepts, and maintain ties with other armies. During the year, unit  readiness  improved  and  steps  were  taken  to  ensure  this  trend line remained in an upward direction for all three components. The activation  of  the  security  force  assistance  brigades  ensured  brigade combat teams  could  focus  on  combined  arms  training  while  at  the same time the Army could sustain its irregular warfare competency and meet the demand from combatant commands for assisting partner nations in developing their security force capabilities. The failure to meet  FY  2018  enlistment  recruiting  goals  in  all  three  components, however, was a matter of great concern for future readiness.

FY  2018  produced  the  most  significant Army  institutional reorganization effort since 1973 with the creation of cross-functional teams  and  then  the  activation  of  Army  Futures  Command.  Additionally, the  Army  Reform Initiative  will  eliminate  redundancy  and  delegate authorities and resources to the lowest appropriate level of command, allowing for rapid actions and decisions in modernization and other Army  enterprises.  Guiding  the  modernization  was  the  continuing refinement of the Multi-Domain Operations concept.

The  end  of  FY  2018  brought  with  it  a  change  from  the  recent past  as  the  Army  entered  FY  2019  operating  on  an  approved budget  instead  of  a  continuing  resolution.  That  fiscal  stability  was welcomed  given  a  global  security  environment  expected  to  grow more competitive and volatile. Looking ahead, senior Army leaders know successfully navigating this environment will require increased attention to recruiting and managing military and civilian personnel, and supporting their families in FY 2019.
