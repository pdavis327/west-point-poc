## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2005

## Introduction

War  and  transformation  dominated  fiscal  year  (FY)  2005  as the  U.S.  Army  commitment  to  Operation IraqI  Freedom (OIF)  and Operation endurIng Freedom (OEF) continued. The strain of multiple deployments, budget challenges, and recruiting difficulties that grew out of these ongoing conflicts influenced Army policies and initiatives. As a result, Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), focused considerable effort throughout the fiscal year on transforming the active Army to better fulfill its missions while reducing strain on soldiers and their families.

With  the  requirement  to  fight  two  protracted  wars  uppermost  in mind,  Army  soldiers  undertook  several  major  initiatives  during  FY 2005 in force structure and management practices in order to improve operational readiness and support capabilities. The largest effort came in  shifting  from  a  war-fighting  force  built  on  divisions  to  one  based on modular brigades. Termed modularization, the creation of modular brigade  combat  teams  (BCTs)  dramatically  changed  the Army's  force structure.  The  initiative  replaced  aspects  of  the  Army  transformation program that began under former Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki and culminated several years of planning by the Training and Doctrine  Command and the Office of the Chief of Staff. The process began during FY 2005 and will continue for the next decade. At the same time, the Army continued to develop its management systems to increase connectivity  between  units  and  to  streamline  logistical  practices.  It pushed  forward  with  the  development  of  the  Future  Combat  Systems (FCS) concept-though increasing complexity continued to plague the process-and initiated implementation of the Lean Six Sigma business methodology  throughout  the  force  in  order  to  improve  efficiency  and eliminate waste. These and other programs sought to transform the Army into a flexible, robust force while still meeting the challenges presented by the Global War on Terrorism.

In conjunction with its emphasis  on  new  force structure and management practices, the Army attempted to provide the manpower for ongoing operations. In personnel matters, the Army struggled to meet its accession goals, although it made improvements during the second half of the fiscal  year.  The  growing  unpopularity  of  the  war  in  Iraq  made  recruitment a  challenge,  resulting  in  the Army  launching  several  new  initiatives  to

induce citizens to enlist. At the same time, the Army made considerable efforts to reform its training system by infusing lessons learned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan into the programs. A major change came with the recognition that all soldiers, not just those in maneuver units, needed to be trained as war fighters. This initiative came directly from the reality of combat in OIF and OEF, where the irregular nature of the conflicts meant that all soldiers, regardless of military occupational specialty, were at risk from attack while on deployment.

As  its  operational  responsibilities  increased,  the  Army  succeeded in  securing  additional  funding  from  Congress.  A  modest  raise  in  the president' s initial budget request from FY 2004, along with supplemental appropriations to fund costs incurred in Iraq, Afghanistan, and hurricane relief operations, combined to produce an overall budget increase of 27 percent over the previous fiscal year. This augmentation enabled the Army to continue its transformation efforts while at the same time meeting its operational obligations.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

Reorganizations and Realignments

On  16  November  2004,  the  Senate  confirmed  the  nomination  of Francis  J.  Harvey  as  Secretary  of  the Army  by  a  vote  of  eighty-five  to twelve.  Secretary  Harvey  replaced  Under  Secretary  of  the  Army  Les Brownlee, who had served as the acting Secretary of the Army since 9 May  2003,  when  Secretary  of  Defense  Donald  H.  Rumsfeld  removed Thomas  E.  White  from  the  position.  With  a  background  as  a  defense industry executive, Harvey faced the challenge of overseeing the Army' s transformation process.

The Army made strides to improve diversity and cultural awareness among its personnel. The  Army  defines  diversity  as  the different attributes, experiences, and backgrounds  of  soldiers,  civilians, and  family  members.  In  an  effort to be a national leader in embracing the  strengths  of  diverse  people  in an inclusive environment, the Army made it a goal to promote culturally astute soldiers and  civilians.  The effort is designed to enhance Army communities and improve the ability of personnel  to  develop  personal relationships  with  individuals  both in and out of the Army. To direct this initiative the Army created the Army Diversity  Office  under  the  Office of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1 (Personnel), in June 2005.

In  addition,  the Army  sought  to  better  manage  the  transmission  of news and information over the radio and television. HQDA reorganized

the Army Broadcasting Agency in FY 2005 and redesignated it as the U.S. Army Soldiers Media Center. It remained a field operating agency under the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs and absorbed several agencies from  the  Army  Public  Affairs  Operations  Group.  Among  the  agencies realigned under the Soldiers Media Center were the Army News Service, Soldiers Radio and Television, and Soldiers magazine. Additionally, the directorates  for  Resources  Management,  Command  Information,  and Community Relations and Outreach-also parts of the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs-became part of the new Soldiers Media Center.

## Management

The Army made an effort to reduce costs while improving efficiency in FY 2005. A major element of this program was a study on the anticipated impacts of implementing the Lean Six Sigma methodology throughout the Army. Army Materiel Command had first employed the methodology in 2002, and in FY 2005 recorded a savings of $110 million. The system contains two complementary parts: Lean, originally developed by Toyota in the 1970s, focuses on reducing waste or eliminating unnecessary steps to increase speed and productivity; and Six Sigma, created by Motorola in 1986, reduces variation to improve quality. The Lean Six Sigma program uses a set of quality management methods, including statistical formulas, and  creates  a  special  infrastructure  of  people  within  the  organization ('Black Belts,' 'Green Belts,' etc.) who are experts in these processes. The  program,  if  formally  adopted  for  the  Army  as  a  whole,  will  take several years to implement.

## Budget

The  Army  budget  in  FY  2005  reflected  the  growing  demands  of continual  transformation,  modernization,  and  operations  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan.  Increases  in  the  president' s  budget  request  focused  on providing the Army with more troops and maintaining a force stretched over  numerous  deployments.  Overall  the  president' s  budget  request represented a modest 4.5 percent increase in funding for the Army from FY 2004 ( Table 1 ).

As  standard procedure, the president' s budget request did not specifically include funding for combat operations, most notably Operations IraqI  Freedom and endurIng  Freedom .  These  funds  were attached to the Defense Department funding bill (Public Law 108-287) as Title IX 'Additional War-Related Appropriations.' When included, the Army's appropriated budget totaled roughly $112 billion. Congress passed the  funding  bill  for  FY  2005  on  5 August  2004.  However,  the Army' s

continuing challenges required additional funds that were provided in a supplemental appropriation bill (Public Law 109-13), passed on 11 May 2005. Just as in FY 2004, actual Army spending significantly exceeded the president' s initial budget request ( Table 2 ).

## Army Strength and Distribution

In FY 2005 the Army was authorized to increase its end strength to 512,400. However, the actual end strength as of 30 September 2005, totaled 492,728: 69,174 commissioned officers, 12,482 warrant officers, 406,923 enlisted soldiers, and 4,149 U.S. Military Academy cadets, a decrease of 5,888 personnel (coming from reductions in enlisted personnel) from the FY 2004 end strength. Minorities constituted 39.2 percent of the active Army  and  women  14.3  percent.  The  Army  National  Guard' s  (ARNG) strength  in September  2005  totaled  333,177:  29,952  commissioned officers, 6,602 warrant officers, and 296,623 enlisted soldiers, a decrease of  9,741  from  the  FY  2004  end  strength.  Minorities  totaled  26  percent of  the Army  National  Guard  and  women  12.8  percent. The  U.S. Army Reserve's  (USAR)  end  strength  in  September  2005  totaled  189,005: 34,406  commissioned  officers,  2,529  warrant  officers,  and  152,070 enlisted  soldiers,  a  decrease  of  14,126  from  the  FY  2004  end  strength. Minorities constituted 40.9 percent of the Army Reserve and women 23.2 percent ( Table 3 ).

## Manning Initiatives

In an attempt to address broad military manpower shortages, the Army reached out to retirees in an effort to bring them back into the service. The  ideal  candidates  were  under  sixty  years  old,  retired  less  than  five years, and matching a rank and military occupational specialty that filled a current need. Those who accepted would return at their former rank but would not be eligible for promotion, though added benefits and additions to retirement pay were available. Of particular need were retirees willing to be trained in civil affairs and deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan. Retirees who held  the  ranks  of  major,  captain,  and  several  noncommissioned  grades were solicited. Likewise, the Army sought retirees to serve as recruiters or other positions requiring specific skills.

The 172d Separate Infantry Brigade led the way for the rest of the  Army in FY 2005 as the first unit manned under the Unit Manning Initiative. Unit  manning  synchronizes  assigning  personnel  with  the  life  cycle  of their unit. This process was a critical element in the Army' s transition to a  modular  brigade  force  (discussed  in  Chapter  4:  Force  Development, Training, and Operational Forces) by abandoning the method of replacing individual soldiers and developing a system that keeps soldiers, officers, and commanders together longer to improve unit cohesion and war fighting effectiveness.

## Enlisted Personnel

In FY 2005, the Army failed to meet its recruiting objectives ( Table 4 ). The deficiency between recruiting goals and actual enlistments for both the active and reserve forces represented the largest margin since 1979.

Table 4-army enlIsTed accessIon resulTs, Fy 2005

| Component   | Goal   | Actual   | Difference   |   Percentage |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Active Army | 80,000 | 73,373   | 6,627        |         91.7 |
| ARNg        | 63,002 | 50,219   | 12,783       |         79.7 |
| USAR        | 28,485 | 23,859   | 4,626        |         83.8 |

Note : ARNg = Army National guard, USAR = U.S. Army Reserve

An increase in violence in Iraq and extended deployments for both active  duty  and  reserve  personnel  contributed  to  declining  enthusiasm among  potential  recruits.  The  bulk  of  enlistment  shortfalls  occurred between January and May 2005, during which time the Army achieved

only 58 percent of its goal. Additionally, the reduced size of the delayed entry pool (made up of individuals who signed a contract to serve at a future date, up to one year in advance, but have not entered basic training) contributed to this shortfall. Typically, the Army strives to have 35 percent of the coming year' s accession goal enrolled in the pool. At the beginning of FY 2005, however, the delayed entry pool amounted to 18 percent of the Army's accession target.

In  addition  to  failing  to  reach  quantitative  recruiting  goals  for  FY 2005, the Army also experienced declines in qualitative benchmarks. In FY 2004, 92 percent of Army recruits possessed high school diplomas, but that number fell to 87 percent in FY 2005 (three points below the Defense Department benchmark of 90 percent). Sixty-seven percent of recruits also scored above average on the Armed Forces Qualification Test in FY 2005, well  above  the  60  percent  Defense  Department  standard,  but  declining from 72 percent in FY 2004. Additionally, the number of 'Category IV' recruits,  those  scoring  in  the  tenth  through  thirtieth  percentiles  on  the qualification test, accepted into the Army rose from 0.5 percent in FY 2004 to 3.9 percent in FY 2005, just below the 4 percent Defense Department ceiling.

Bonuses and incentives remained a proven means of manning the allvolunteer Army. Though the recruiting environment remained a challenge during the fiscal year due to economic conditions, alternatives to service, and growing criticisms among the general public over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, recruiters utilized incentives and advertising to compete in the market and meet annual recruitment goals. Bonuses remained the primary and most effective tool to fill military occupation specialties. The Army offered a range of bonuses up to $20,000 to qualified recruits. In addition, the Army continued to utilize the Army College Fund to attract recruits who wished to serve the nation and earn money for college. While this  program  targeted  potential  recruits  who  had  not  attended  college, the Army's Loan Repayment Program, which offered up to $65,000, was aimed at recruits who already had some form of college education. Both of these programs enabled the Army to compete for high-quality candidates.

The  Army  succeeded  in  reducing  some  of  the  negative  effects  of recruiting shortfalls by exceeding all enlisted retention targets ( Table 5 ). In addition to soldiers' dedication prompting their reenlistment, the Army used the Selective Reenlistment Bonus program to encourage soldiers to rejoin the service at the end of their service obligations. The program paid up to $15,000 for soldiers reenlisting while deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, or Kuwait. It also offered lump sum cash payments of $10,000 to $40,000 for  soldiers  in  high-priority  specialties.  Finally,  the  program  provided bonuses of $10,000 and $15,000 for soldiers who reenlisted to serve with specific units. All Army components benefited from the program.

Table 5-enlIsTed acTIve army reTenTIon, Fy 2005

| Personnel    | Goal   | Obtained   |   Percentage |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Initial Term | 26,938 | 27,818     |        103.3 |
| Mid-career   | 23,773 | 24,407     |        102.7 |
| Career       | 13,454 | 17,287     |        128.5 |
| Total        | 64,165 | 69,512     |        108.3 |

The  Army  made  a  supplemental  request  to  the  National  Defense Authorization Act 2005 to provide bonuses to active component soldiers who agreed to join the reserves at the end of their service obligations. The Reserve Component Affiliation Bonus would increase the bonus from the standard $50 per month to a $10,000 lump sum payment for a minimum three-year commitment. The bonus helped the reserve component meet its end strength requirements with seasoned soldiers who were often combat veterans.

## Officer Personnel

In FY 2005 the Army accessioned 4,325 officers. The Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program produced 2,641 officers for the active component as well as 958 for the Army National Guard and 579 for the Army Reserve. The size of the Corps of Cadets at the United States Military Academy remained steady at four thousand cadets, producing less than a thousand graduates per year. With these limits, the Army' s Officer Candidate School worked to fill the gap in accessions. Its production more than doubled from 484 in FY 2000 to 1,011 in FY 2005.

To  help  build  up  the  officer  ranks  to  meet  future  needs,  the Army consistently increased its accession goals starting in FY 2000 (with the exception of FY 2004). The FY 2005 accession target stands at 4,600, up from 4,000 in FY 2000. Though the Army failed over the past five years to fully realize its growing officer accession goals, the deficit never exceeded 5 percent. Those shortages stemmed from a combination of the lingering effects of the Army' s drawdown during the 1990s and the recent transition to the brigade combat team structure under the modular force initiative.

The Army took several steps to address a projected annual shortage through 2013 of 3,000 basic-branch captains and majors. The Presidential Declaration of National Emergency after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks enabled the Army to exceed the promotion goals established by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. It also allowed the Army to increase the number of officers offered selective continuation. Under existing regulations, officers not selected for promotion by two successive

boards were involuntarily separated under the 'up or out' system. Under the new authority the soldiers could continue to serve at their current levels at the discretion of the Army.

In addition to limiting the number of officers involuntarily separated, the  Army  also  sought  to  increase  promotion  rates  to  help  address  the shortage  of  mid-career  officers. The Army  continued  to  require  thirtyeight months in grade as first lieutenant before promotion to captain as established in 2002. The Army reduced the time-in-service milestone to major from eleven years to ten years.

The Army  adopted  new  measures  to  induce  officers  to  voluntarily increase  their  service  obligation.  One  program  allows  U.S.  Military Academy  and  ROTC  cadets  to  guarantee  their  branch  of  service  in exchange for an additional three-year service obligation. Another permits cadets to select an initial post of service in return for an additional threeyear obligation. Finally, the Army expanded an existing program to offer fully funded graduate school opportunities in exchange for an increase in the Active Duty Service Obligation.

## Civilian Personnel

Civilians  continued  to  play  a  large  role  in  the Army,  with  258,418 serving in appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund military functions, civilian functions, and as employed foreign nationals. The Army employed 243,436  civilians as of 30  September  2005  in  military  functions, constituting 34.3 percent of the Defense Department' s civilian personnel. The  direct-hire  appropriated  fund  workforce  totaled  217,052  civilians, broken down into administrative (31 percent), professional (23 percent), technical (17 percent), blue collar (16 percent), clerical (9 percent), and other  (4  percent)  positions. The Army  also  employed  7,791  direct-hire foreign  nationals  and  18,593  indirect-hire  foreign  nationals  in  military functions. Indirect-hire foreign nationals are non-U.S. citizens hired in a foreign area under the terms of an agreement between the host nation and the United States.

Work continued during FY 2005 on the National Security Personnel System. Authorized in FY 2004, it replaced the General Schedule grade and step system with a pay band system intended to provide more flexibility in establishing pay levels. The Defense Department issued draft regulations in February and will begin implementation in FY 2006.

## Special Topics

On 22 August 2005, the Army awarded the Medal of Honor to Sfc. Paul R. Smith for his actions in Iraq in 2003. Sergeant Smith is the first

AwArd of the MedAl of honor



Sergeant First Class Paul R. Smith ,  Company B, 11th Engineer Battalion, United States Army, distinguished himself  by  acts  of  gallantry  and  intrepidity  above  and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy near Baghdad International Airport, Baghdad, Iraq on 4 April, 2003. On that day, Sergeant First Class Smith was engaged in the construction of a prisoner of war holding area when his Task Force was violently attacked by a company-sized enemy force. Realizing the vulnerability of over 100 fellow soldiers, Sergeant First Class Smith quickly organized a hasty defense consisting of two platoons of soldiers, one Bradley Fighting Vehicle and three armored personnel carriers. As the fight developed, Sergeant First Class Smith braved hostile enemy fire to personally engage the enemy with hand grenades and anti-tank weapons, and organized the evacuation of three wounded soldiers from an armored

personnel carrier struck by a rocket propelled grenade and a 60 mm mortar round. Fearing the enemy would overrun  their  defenses, Sergeant First Class Smith moved  under  withering enemy fire  to  man  a  .50 caliber  machine  gun mounted  on  a  damaged armored personnel carrier. In  total  disregard  for  his own life, he maintained his exposed position in order to engage the attacking enemy force. During this action, he was mortally wounded. His courageous actions helped defeat the enemy attack, and resulted in as many as 50 enemy soldiers killed, while allowing the safe withdrawal of numerous wounded soldiers. Sergeant First Class Smith' s extraordinary heroism and uncommon valor are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the Third Infantry Division 'Rock of the Marne,' and the United States Army.

soldier to be awarded the Medal of Honor since 1993 and the first since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism.

For  the  first  time  since  World War II a female soldier received the Silver Star Medal. Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester of the 617th Military Police Company, a National Guard unit out of  Richmond,  Kentucky,  received the  award  along  with  two  other members  of  her  unit,  Spec.  Jason Mike  and  S.  Sgt.  Timothy  Nein (whose  award  would  be  upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross in  2007),  for  their  actions  during an  ambush  of  their  convoy  on  20 March near Salman Pak, Iraq. Sergeant Hester, 23, and her squad were  shadowing  a  supply  convoy

when roughly fifty insurgents attacked. Hester and Nein led their men in clearing several trenches. She assaulted one trench line with grenades and M203 grenade-launcher rounds and killed three insurgents with her rifle. The fight ended with twenty-seven insurgents dead, six wounded, and one captured. Three members of the 617th were wounded in the assault.

In addition to these individual awards, on 2 May U.S. Army Chief of Staff  Peter  J.  Schoomaker  approved  the  creation  of  the  Combat Action Badge (CAB) to provide special recognition to soldiers who personally engage or are engaged by the enemy. The CAB grew out of complaints that the Army did not have an award comparable to the Combat Infantry Badge or the Combat Medical Badge for soldiers in other branches who engaged in  combat,  particularly  those  in  cavalry,  armor,  and  other  combat  arms units. Previous reviews of the Combat Infantry Badge rejected alterations to recognize such units out of the belief that it would detract from the prestige of the badge. However, with the increasingly blurred line between combat and support duties in OIF and OEF, calls again arose for the creation of a new badge. In mid-2004, the Army's senior leadership directed a task force to  examine  the  idea  of  creating  a  combat  badge  designed  to  recognize noninfantry soldiers who engaged in direct combat with the enemy. The task force initially supported the idea of a close combat badge to recognize soldiers in units reorganized to serve as infantry and conducting infantry unique missions. However, this concept also proved inadequate as it would not apply to all soldiers, such as military police, who came into contact

with the enemy. Eventually the Army rejected the plan to only recognize those performing infantry missions and created the Combat Action Badge to apply to all soldiers. The requirements for the award do not contain any branch and military occupational specialty stipulations. To qualify for the new badge soldiers do not need to be assigned to a combat arms unit, a unit organized to conduct close or offensive combat operations, or a unit

that performs offensive combat operations. However, not all soldiers who serve in a combat zone or imminent danger area immediately qualify for the  badge,  but  rather  only  those  who  engage  the  enemy. Authorization for  the  Combat Action Badge dates from 18 September 2001 to a date to be determined. At the same time, the Army revised AR-600-8-22 to clarify  the  eligibility  requirements  for  the  Combat  Infantry  Badge  and the Combat Medical Badge. All three badges hold equal precedence. On 29 June, General Schoomaker and Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth O. Preston presented the first Combat Action Badges to five soldiers in a ceremony at the Pentagon.

Based on personnel needs incurred in the Global War on Terrorism the Army reinstituted the Army unit stop-loss program after the terrorist attacks in 2001. It authorized the Army to involuntarily extend a service member's  active  duty  service  under  the  enlistment  contract  in  order  to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service date and up to their contractually  agreed  end  of  obligated  service.  Department  of  Defense guidance remained to discontinue the program as soon as operationally feasible. The Army conducts a quarterly review to determine the program' s

continuation or termination. As of January 2005, the current stop-loss program affected a total of 13,445 soldiers in all components.

Suicides  in  FY  2005  totaled eighty-seven, up from sixty-four in FY 2004. The Office of the Deputy Chief  of  Staff,  G-1  (Personnel), began funding Question, Persuade, Refer workshops Army-wide to provide additional resources for suicide  prevention  awareness  and intervention training. The  Army Office of the Surgeon General continued to deploy Mental Health Assessment Teams to Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2005 team report verified that suicide prevention training was being conducted at various intervals during the deployment cycle, primarily by Unit Ministry Teams  with occasional assistance  from  behavioral  health assets.  The  report  also  discovered that soldiers' perceptions  of the adequacy of suicide prevention training had decreased from previous years.

Army Combat Uniform



During the fiscal year, the Army also began a program to phase out its Battle Dress Uniform and replace it with a new Army Combat Uniform (ACU). The ACU consists of a jacket, trousers, moisture wicking t-shirt, and tan combat boots, which replace the standard black boots and do not need to be shined. In January 2003 soldiers from the 3d (Stryker) Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, started testing various models of the uniform under consideration.  After  listening  to  comments,  the  design  team  instituted changes that resulted in the approved design. Beginning in February 2005, soldiers deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan received ACUs.

Each  change  has  a  practical  justification.  Detachable  name  and insignia badges increase their life span and do not need to be sewn on. Replacing  buttons  with  zippers  and Velcro  improves  flexibility,  access, and comfort while wearing body armor. For its most notable change, the ACUs utilize a digitally produced Universal Camouflage Pattern in neutral colors designed to work in woodland, desert, and urban combat situations.

Designers removed black from the camouflage because it does not appear in nature and is more eye-catching. Instead, the ACUs utilize green, grey, and brown, a color palette more suited to the varied environments soldiers operate  in. The  black  beret  remains  the  normal  headgear  for  the ACU; however, a matching patrol cap can be worn at the commander' s discretion. Though initially more expensive to purchase, the ACUs are more durable with  reduced  out-of-pocket  cleaning  costs.  New  enlistees  will  receive ACUs beginning in 2006. The rollover to the new uniform is scheduled to be completed by FY 2007.

In the summer of 2005 the Secretary of the Army Transition Team's Leadership and Culture Panel assessed the Army's leadership and culture to  determine  its  ability  to  meet  the  realities  of  the  twenty-first  century security  environment.  It  also  evaluated  whether  the  Army' s  leadership programs  developed  sufficient  leaders,  both  military  and  civilian,  for that  environment.  In  July,  the  secretary  of  the Army  created  a  Review of  Education,  Training,  and  Assignments  for  Leaders  Task  Force  that included  a  consulting  body;  a  red  team;  and  officer,  noncommissioned officer, and civilian teams. Each team had the following tasks: identify the skills and attributes of the twenty-first-century 'Pentathlete' based upon the secretary of the Army and chief of staff of the Army vision; analyze existing  Army  policies  and  programs  to  maximize  efficiency;  evaluate existing  training,  education,  and  assignment  policies  and  programs  and recommend additions, modifications, and deletions; and highlight current policies  and  programs  that  are  being  done  to  standard  and  need  to  be maintained. Recommendations from each team are to be submitted to the secretary of the Army and chief of staff for approval in FY 2006.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Army transformation continued to be the driving force in developing the  Army's  combat  elements  in  FY  2005.  Major  components  in  the transformation process included restructuring units to a modular design, rebalancing  and  stabilizing  the  current  force,  and  reforming  training programs to better meet current and future missions. At the same time, the Army continued to conduct operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world in support of the Global War on Terrorism.

## Modularity

In September 2003, the U.S. Army began converting from a combat force  centered  on  divisions  containing  between  10,000  and  18,000 soldiers  to  a  force  based  on  brigades  totaling  at  most  3,900  soldiers. This became known as modularity, which the Army defined as a design methodology to create standardized, expandable Army elements capable of  being  tailored  to  accomplish  virtually  any  assignment.  The  new units would be as capable as their predecessors, but they would also be adaptable enough to assume any form necessary to meet a broad range of missions.

General  Schoomaker  was  the  driving  force  behind  modularity. Within a month of taking office as chief of staff in the summer of 2003, he instructed the Army to begin converting to a modular, brigade-based force.  General  Schoomaker  stressed  that  the Army  needed  to  adjust its  priorities  to  continue  to  meet  the  challenges  of  fighting  wars  in Afghanistan and Iraq, a long-time commitment in Korea, continuing stability operations in the Balkans and the Sinai, and counterterrorism operations in various countries around the world. When Schoomaker became  chief  of  staff,  73  percent  of  the  Regular  Army's  brigade combat  teams  and  33  percent  of  the  Army  National  Guard's  teams were  deployed  overseas  in  the  Balkans,  the  Sinai,  Afghanistan,  and Iraq.  Since  the  Army  relied  mainly  on  unit  rotations  rather  than individual replacements to fill personnel requirements, and since many rotations involved only a brigade combat team, the brigade, rather than the  division,  had  become  the  main  tactical  echelon  in  planning  for

deployments. Focusing on modular brigades eliminated the practice of slicing off support elements from divisions, which limits the division's readiness. More critically, the change would allow for the creation of additional brigade combat teams, increasing the Army's readiness and efficiency in meeting its missions.

To  facilitate  the  transition  to  a  modular-based  force,  General Schoomaker  had  created Task  Force  Modularity  in  early  September 2003.  Along  with  efforts  by  the  3d  Infantry  Division  and  Training and Doctrine Command, Task Force Modularity spent the next sixteen months designing the new modules. It concluded that a modular Army would require  several  types  of  units  (termed  units  of  action):  heavy brigade combat teams; infantry brigade combat teams; Stryker brigade combat  teams;  aviation  brigades;  strike  brigades  (later  termed  fires brigades); reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition brigades (later designated battlefield surveillance brigades); protection brigades (later designated maneuver enhancement brigades and changed again to combat support brigades [maneuver enhancement]); and sustainment brigades.  After General Schoomaker  approved  the  final report's conclusions in early 2005, the task force disbanded.

Once the transition is complete the new modules will be self-sufficient and standardized brigade combat teams that can be more readily deployed and combined with other Army and joint forces to meet the precise needs of the Combatant Commanders. Modularity will increase the combat power of the active component by 30 percent as well as the size of the overall pool of available forces by 60 percent. The total number of available brigades will increase from forty-eight to seventy-seven with ten active brigades (three-and-a-third divisions in previous terminology) being added by the end of 2006.

In addition to the brigade modules, the new design included units-ofemployment at two, and possibly three, echelons above the brigade level. These will serve as headquarters at the higher tactical level (commanded by a major general) and the operational level (commanded by a lieutenant general), with an intermediate level available should circumstances dictate. In order to meld the new design to current lineages, General Schoomaker approved a plan developed by the U.S. Army Center of Military History that  called  for  minimal  changes  in  unit  designation. While  critics  feared the limited changes could devalue the impact of modularity on the Army' s organization, the Center advised that maintaining unit lineages would provide soldiers with a sense of stability and reduce potential negative impacts on morale. The Army would announce a formal lineage plan in FY 2006.

With  the  initial  modular  design  plan  in  place  at  the  beginning  of 2005,  the  first  two  units  to  convert  to  a  modular  organization,  the  3d Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division, began the transition in

preparation for their scheduled deployments in FY 2006. The 3d Infantry Division transformed its three brigades into four heavy BCTs with two armor-mechanized  infantry  battalions  and  an  armed  reconnaissance battalion ( Chart 1 ).

The 101st Airborne Division converted its three brigades to infantry BCTs (also adding a fourth brigade) with each containing two infantry battalions and an armed reconnaissance and surveillance battalion ( Chart 2 ).  The 10th Mountain Division and the 4th Infantry Division are scheduled to undergo modularization in FY 2006.

In a related measure, the Army continued work on an Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) system started in 2004 that would apply to the new modular force. The goal of ARFORGEN is to generate forces in a rotational manner that will support two years at home following every year deployed for the active Army, four years at home following each year deployed for the Army Reserve, and five years at home following each year deployed for the National Guard. This program provides more time  to  train,  predictable  deployment  schedules,  and  the  continuous supply of landpower required by the Combatant Commanders and civil authorities.

## Rebalancing and Stabilization

Since  the  beginning  of  extended  deployments  with  the  Global War on  Terrorism,  the  Army' s  active  and  reserve  component  structure  has proved inadequate for rapid deployment and sustainment. In addition to the shift to modularization, the Army sought to rebalance its combat forces to increase units with special skills that are routinely in high demand by Combatant Commanders such as infantry, military police, transportation, and civil  affairs. To  accomplish  this  goal  the Army  began  transitioning soldiers  to  more  high-demand  specializations  in  order  to  increase  unit readiness for rapid deployment by decreasing training time to meet mission requirements.

Along  with  rebalancing  force  structure,  the  Army  also  worked to  improve  unit  cohesion  by  keeping  soldiers  in  units  longer  to  reduce chronically high turnover rates and increase training proficiency and overall combat readiness. Units that stay together longer build higher levels of teamwork, understand their duties and equipment better, and require less periodic retraining. These unit manning policies also improved the quality of  life  and  predictability  for  soldiers,  families,  and  civilian  employers. The  172d  Separate  Infantry  Brigade  (Alaska)  initiated  the  stabilization process and the Army will man four more brigades using this method by the beginning of the next calendar year.

## Army Aviation

The Army began transforming its aviation forces to develop modular, capabilities-based units. The shift to a modular structure reduced the number of  aviation  brigade  designs  from  seven  to  two.  Resources  and  successful new technologies  from  the  canceled  Comanche  program  were  redirected into other aviation programs. This reallocation accelerated the unmanned aerial vehicle, light utility helicopter, and armed reconnaissance helicopter programs. For example, the Army began taking proposals for a new light utility helicopter in July, with the selection scheduled for FY 2006.

The  future  cargo  aircraft  program,  also  a  recipient  of  additional focused  resources,  continued  to  work  to  improve  intra-theater  lift capacity. As a part of this effort the CH-47F heavy lift helicopter will go into production in FY 2006. In regard to its aviation elements as a whole,  the Army  will  purchase  more  than  eight  hundred  new  aircraft including 108  attack, 365  utility, and  368  armed  reconnaissance helicopters over the next seven years. In one case, the Army's UH-60M program received authorization from the Pentagon's Defense Acquisition Board to produce twenty-two aircraft in FY 2005 and forty in FY 2006. The Army plans to make a decision on the full-rate production of twelve

CH-47F (followed by the aircraft it replaced, a CH-47D)



hundred  aircraft  by  FY  2007. These  initiatives  promise  to  extend  the life of the Army's critical aviation assets beyond 2020, reducing the age of  the  Army's  aviation  fleet,  improving  readiness  rates,  and  reducing maintenance costs.

## Training

A  critical  element  in  Army  transformation  continued  to  be  the training  of  soldiers  and  leaders.  In  2003,  General  Schoomaker  directed Task  Force  Soldier  to  examine  all  initial  military  and  entry  training programs  to  ensure  soldiers  received  the  necessary  training  to  prepare for combat. Training and Doctrine Command then took the task force's recommendations and began reforming the Army's training program. The idea that every soldier is a soldier first, regardless of military occupational specialty, is at the heart of the warrior tasks and battle drills incorporated into  all  basic  training  and  one-station  unit  training. The  new  program, implemented in FY 2005, designated thirty-nine critical warrior tasks and nine battle drills that soldiers must be able to perform before successfully completing  initial  entry  training.  These  included  more  combat  skills, enhanced marksmanship training, improved first aid, and the conduct of more field, night, and live-fire exercises. Soldiers received their weapons on day three and kept them with them at all times over the course of the

nine-week program. In addition, trainers integrated improvised explosive device simulators, pyrotechnic devices with pop-up targets, and simulated rocket and mortar attacks. The reforms incorporated lessons learned from OIF and OEF to more adequately prepare all soldiers for the challenges of the modern battlefield.

For officers, the  Army began transitioning to a Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC) in FY 2005. The course has three phases and provides a standardized, small-unit leadership experience that flows progressively through  BOLC  I-precommissioning  training;  BOLC  II-basic  combat leadership, warrior skills, and fieldcraft training attended by all officers, regardless of branch or gender; and BOLC III-branch-specific training. The revolutionary plan mixed officers and noncommissioned officers from different  jobs  for  a  cross-training  experience  intended  to  provide  every new Army leader with basic combat skills. BOLC I implementation began in FY 2005 while BOLC II and III remained in the pilot phase, with full implementation scheduled to begin in FY 2006.

Changes in initial entry training required instructors to develop new skills as well.  The Army traditionally focused training for combat support

and combat service support soldiers on the particular skills required by their  military  occupational  specialty. The Army  did  not  have  sufficient drill sergeants to train all new recruits in combat skills, so it implemented a Combat Leadership Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, to train combat support  and  combat  service  support  drill  sergeants  in  the  warrior  tasks they will teach when the Army adopts the full BOLC program.

Additional changes to the Army training program included increased funding to adapt ranges and facilities to reflect likely combat situations; increased ammunition allocations to improve live-fire weapons training; and required live-fire training of additional weapons systems to improve individual and unit competency and adaptability. The Defense Language Institute also adjusted its requirements to meet the operational need for soldiers in Iraq who could speak Arabic. Finally, as the Army shifted to a modular force, the Combat Training Center Program worked to export similar  training  experiences  (such  as  training  for  joint  operations  or  to interact  with  foreign  indigenous  forces)  to  home  stations  to  reduce deployment requirements for training.

## Deployed Operational Forces

Operation IraqI  Freedom continued  to  escalate  in  2005  as  the insurgency  gained  strength.  The  U.S.  Army  deployed  roughly  132,400

soldiers to Iraq and the surrounding area by the end of FY 2005 (including the Army National Guard and Army Reserve) out of a total U.S. force of 192,600. This force, consisting of thirteen brigade combat teams (of which  five  came  from  the Army  National  Guard),  constituted  the  third deployment rotation during OIF. As the major contributor of ground forces to  the  OIF  coalition,  the  U.S. Army  endured  steady  casualties  over  the course of the year ( Table 6 ).

General  George  W.  Casey  Jr.,  commander  of  the  Multi-National Force-Iraq, continued to implement a counterinsurgency strategy during the fiscal year. He focused first on Baghdad and the surrounding cities in order to eliminate safe havens for insurgents. In October 2004, 3,000 U.S. soldiers and 2,000 Iraqis tried to quell insurgent activity in Samarra. In November, Army units took part in Operation al-Fajr (also known as Operation Phantom Fury ), in which 6,000 marines, 1,500 soldiers, and 2,000 Iraqis conducted a major effort to clear the city of Al Fallujah of insurgents.  In  some  of  the  heaviest  urban  combat  involving American forces since the battle of Hue City in Vietnam in 1968, coalition forces

mounted  a  six-week  campaign  to destroy  the  insurgent  presence  in the  city.  After  a  lull  in  American operations  during  the  winter,  the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment moved  into  northwestern  Iraq  in May 2005 and began preparations to secure the border with Syria and break the insurgent hold on the city of Tal Afar. In September coalition forces launched their assault, quickly clearing the city and beginning phase IV operations.

Substantial  progress  came  in establishing an Iraqi government in FY 2005. The Coalition Provisional Authority  disbanded  on  28  June 2004, and transferred sovereign authority for governing Iraq to the

Iraqi interim government. Based on the timetable laid out in the  Transitional Administrative Law, the interim government operated Iraq until elections on 30 January 2005; thereafter, the Iraqi transitional government assumed

authority.  In  May,  the  transitional  government  appointed  a  multiethnic committee  to  draft  a  new  Iraqi  constitution.  The  committee  finalized a draft in September 2005 and scheduled a national referendum for the following month.

In  Afghanistan,  Operation endurIng  Freedom remained  relatively static  during  FY  2005. The Army  had  roughly  15,000  soldiers  (from all components) in and around Afghanistan by 30 September 2005 (out of a total U.S. strength of 19,500). Casualties remained low, increasing mainly after the harsh winter subsided and the campaign season began ( Table 7 ).

The new year brought changes to both the Army' s maneuver forces and senior commander in Afghanistan. On 15 March the Army commenced its sixth major force rotation in OEF. The Southern European Task Force, under the command of Maj. Gen. Jason K. Kamiya, began replacing the 25th  Infantry  Division  as  Combined  Joint  Task  Force-76  (the  Army' s maneuver  force  component).  The  following  May,  Lt.  Gen.  Karl  W . Eikenberry replaced Lt. Gen. David W . Barno as commander of Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan.

Overall,  the  Army  continued  to  implement  a  counterinsurgency strategy  in Afghanistan  and  to  support  the  build  up  of Afghan  security forces and the stabilization of the Afghan government. On 9 October 2004, Afghanistan held its first presidential elections.  The results were announced on 3 November, with Hamid Karzai being elected president. In February, the National Military Academy of Afghanistan began training officers for

the Afghan National Army. In July the Office of Military CooperationAfghanistan  changed  its  name  to  the  Office  of  Security  CooperationAfghanistan  and  officially  assumed  responsibility  for  the  U.S.  role  in reforming  the Afghan  National  Police  force.  Finally,  on  19  September, Afghans  took  part  in  national  parliamentary  elections,  completing  a fundamental step in creating a new government.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Change

Concurrent with the active  Army' s transition to a modular force the  Army National Guard began the process of reorganizing and converting to brigade combat teams. In one example, Virginia Governor Mark Warner approved a  re-stationing  plan  for  the Virginia Army  National  Guard. The Virginia National Guard developed a state command plan for how to reorganize units based on guidance and regulations provided by the National Guard Bureau and the Army. The plan provided information for the development of a restationing plan to determine how to effectively position units and personnel across the state.  Corresponding efforts occurred in multiple states, along with the conversion of several National Guard units to titular BCTs. Overall, the headquarters for the 39th Infantry BCT (Arkansas); 116th BCT, 29th Infantry Division (Virginia); 27th Infantry BCT (New Y ork); 30th Armored BCT (North  Carolina);  81st Armored  BCT  (Washington);  and  1st  BCT, 34th Infantry Division (Minnesota), formally transitioned from legacy to modular brigades in FY 2005.

## Personnel Management

The Army National Guard's end strength in September 2005 totaled 333,177, a decrease of 9,741 from the previous year. It included 29,952 commissioned  officers,  6,602  warrant  officers,  and  296,623  enlisted soldiers.  Minorities constituted 26 percent of the Army National Guard while women accounted for 12.8 percent. The Army Reserve' s end strength in September  2005  totaled  189,005:  34,406  commissioned  officers, 2,529 warrant officers, and 152,070 enlisted soldiers. This amounted to a decrease of 14,126 from the FY 2004 end strength. Minorities constituted 40.9 percent of the Army Reserve and women made up 23.2 percent.

## Recruiting and Retention

Army  National  Guard  and  Army  Reserve  recruiting  shortfalls during  FY  2005  represented  the  third  year  in  a  row  that  accession targets went unmet. The cumulative effect resulted in both organizations

failing to achieve their end-strength targets by 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively. One standard source of Army Reserve and Army National Guard accessions, active Army soldiers who had completed their service obligations,  became  less  productive.  Retention  incentives  encouraged more soldiers to reenlist in the active Army, which forced the reserve components to rely more heavily on recruits from the American public. This proved increasingly difficult because of declining enthusiasm for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Like the active Army, the Army National Guard and Army Reserve hoped to counter their difficulties in recruiting new members by persuading current soldiers to reenlist. In pursuit of this goal the reserve components increased reenlistment bonuses, offering up to $15,000 to those who agreed to stay in uniform for an additional six years.

## Training and Readiness

During FY 2005, the  Army National Guard continued to manage its overall readiness by prioritizing resources in support of the National Military Strategy. Since 11 September 2001, the ARNG has deployed more than 69 percent of its personnel in the Global War on Terrorism, homeland defense efforts, and state missions. Since July 2002, overall unit readiness has decreased by 41 percent while providing personnel and equipment to units to ensure fully manned and equipped ARNG forces for deployment. Personnel, training, and equipmenton-hand  decreased  between  18  percent  and  36  percent  while  equipment readiness declined by 10.1 percent during the same period.

The Army National Guard worked with U.S. Army Forces Command and  HQDA in the development of an ARFORGEN model. This model provided  predictability  of  forces  available  and  ready  for  operational deployments. It amounted to a paradigm shift, changing unit resourcing from a tiered to a time-sequenced approach based on when a unit could expect  to  deploy. The ARNG  developed  improved  training  models  that increased  resources  and  training  events  to  produce  readiness  leading up to a unit' s expected deployment availability. The new program made deployments more predictable for ARNG soldiers, as well as their families and employers.

To  better  manage  the  state  of  units  for  future  deployments,  the Department of Defense implemented the use of the Defense Readiness Reporting  System. The  system  is  a  Web-based  readiness  program  that provides a near real-time assessment of a unit' s capability to execute its wartime  or  other  assigned  missions  based  on  its  ability  to  execute  its mission-essential  tasks. This  system  allows  the  Office  of  the  Secretary of Defense, Combatant Commands, and the services direct access to unit readiness assessments.

Full-time support remained a critical component for achieving soldier and  unit-level  readiness.  Full-time  ARNG  members  were  responsible for  organizing,  administering,  instructing,  training,  and  recruiting  new personnel, as well as maintaining supplies, equipment, and aircraft. Fulltime  support  personnel  were  essential  to  successful  transitions  from peacetime  to  wartime,  and  are  critical  links  to  the  integration  of  the Army's components. To meet readiness requirements, the chief, National Guard Bureau, in concert with the state adjutants general, prioritized the increase of full-time support authorizations as the priority for the ARNG. While some progress has been made in recent years to increase full-time support manning levels in ARNG units, obstacles remained in obtaining acceptable  full-time  support  levels  necessary  to  achieve  unit  readiness. During  FY  2005, ARNG  resourcing  totaled  63  percent  of  its  full-time support requirements (53,278 authorized of 84,452 required), the lowest resourcing level of any Department of Defense reserve component.

## Mobilizations

In  FY  2005  more  than  141,700  soldiers  from  the ARNG  were  on active duty at home and abroad. Mobilizations for 2005 reached a new high  for  the ARNG  since  11  September  2001,  with  one  division,  nine brigade combat teams, and more than 16,000 combat service and combat service support troops totaling 104,169 soldiers mobilized simultaneously, with 74,360 deployed. The deployment of ARNG troops enabled the active Army to continue its reset process and modularization while fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The ARNG deployed more than fifteen thousand soldiers to more than thirty-eight different countries in support of the Combatant Commanders' exercises and overseas training requirements. Missions included military exercises,  engineer  troop  construction  projects,  aviation  maintenance support, military police support, direct and general support maintenance, finance and  postal support, medical  support, linguist and  counterintelligence missions, and signal support. The ARNG provided 310,400 man-days and $11 million in additional pay and allowances to support the Combatant Commands in FY 2005.

The  2005  Atlantic  hurricane  season,  the  most  intense  and  active in  recorded  history,  produced  the  largest  ever  ARNG  disaster  relief mobilization. Most relief efforts came in response to Hurricane Katrina, a Category 5 storm that struck New Orleans on 29 August and caused destruction along the entire Gulf Coast. The levee system surrounding New Orleans failed due to the storm surge, causing the city to flood. The storm destroyed approximately 350,000 homes and displaced over one  million  evacuees. The ARNG  responded  by  mobilizing  a  total  of

The Superdome was used as a central staging and relocation center for thousands of displaced New Orleans residents affected by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.



50,087 soldiers and airmen and 146 rotary-wing aircraft to the impact zone, with thousands more providing coordination and logistical support from  numerous  locations. The ARNG  aviation  community  flew  more than 7,300 missions, transported nearly 6,200 civilians to safe havens, and transported soldiers to disaster zones in Louisiana and Mississippi to assist civilian authorities in establishing law and order. In late September, Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast to the east of Houston, Texas. Another Category  5  storm,  Rita  caused  the  mass  evacuation  of  millions  from Houston  and  the  surrounding  areas.  It  pulled  ARNG  resources  away from the Katrina relief effort while also causing New Orleans to re-flood. The two storms combined to produce nearly $100 billion in damages and approximately two thousand deaths. The ARNG continued relief efforts into FY 2006.

The ARNG also scheduled and coordinated the logistical task forces that supported six mobilized ARNG brigades during their training at the National  Training  Center  and  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center.  In addition, initial planning conferences for five brigade-sized elements were hosted that paved the way for successful postmobilization training. Nine mobilized ARNG brigades participated in urban operations seminars and

mission rehearsal exercises through the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Additionally, ARNG military police and combat engineer  platoons  trained  with  the United States Army Special Forces.

## Materiel and Aviation

The Operational Support Airlift Agency  at  Fort  Belvoir,  Virginia, a Department  of  the  Army  field operating agency under the National Guard  Bureau,  directed  a  network of geographically dispersed, yet centrally controlled, military aircraft that provide transportation for both personnel and cargo. This field operating agency managed the majority of the 170 Army fixed-wing aircraft for wartime  requirements and routinely supported all government agencies while training for wartime readiness. Combat support included transporting timesensitive and mission-critical supplies and personnel in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, and the Horn of Africa.

The  agency's  fixed-wing  aircraft  transported  much  needed  supplies and  personnel  throughout  the  Gulf  Coast  for  relief  efforts  following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Both at home and abroad these aircraft flew more than 50,808 hours, transported over 9.1  million  pounds  of  cargo, and carried 66,753 passengers during FY 2005. The flight hours reflect an  emphasis  on  cargo  lift  and  demonstrate  the  critical  role  fixed-wing cargo aircraft serve in war fighter and homeland security missions. ARNG aviation moved approximately 7,300 tons of equipment, food, sandbags, and life-saving supplies, and rescued nearly 16,000 people. Between 29 August and the end of FY 2005, the ARNG flew a total of 5,341 hours and aviation support for these efforts remained at sixty-seven aircraft. After Hurricane Rita, the ARNG flew 185 missions, transported 117 civilian and military personnel, moved 31 tons of supplies, and conducted 19 rescue or life-saving missions through the end of the fiscal year in Texas.

Army National Guard aviation completed 119 percent of the flying hours  projected  for  the  fiscal  year.  This  represents  an  average  of  10.8 
aircrew  flying  hours  per  month-the  highest  level  since  achieving  9.1 hours in FY 1996. During FY 2005, an average of 358 aircrews deployed each month in support of Operation noble eagle ,  Operation endurIng Freedom ,  the  Balkans  (Kosovo  Force  and  Stabilization  Force  Bosnia), and Operation IraqI  Freedom . ARNG aircrews flew more than 100,000 flying  hours  in  support  of  the  Global War  on Terrorism,  an  increase  of 65  percent  from  FY  2004.  The  ARNG  flew  more  than  260,000  total hours in support of homeland security, training, counterdrug, and combat operations missions. Even with 21 percent of the ARNG aviation force structure deployed, the Army aviation transformation process continued. As aircraft were redistributed to modernize units, aircrew qualification and proficiency training accelerated to rapidly meet emerging deployments.

## Reset

Major  combat  and  stability  operations  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan continued to place tremendous demands on soldiers and equipment. As a  result,  units  returning  home  needed  to  replenish  their  equipment  and prepare soldiers for future missions. The Army calls this process 'reset,' and it includes providing additional training and professional development for soldiers, bringing unit readiness back up to Army standards, retraining essential tasks to incorporate lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, and adjusting pre-positioned stocks of ammunition  and  equipment to  support  the  force.  The  standard  turnaround  for  active  and  reserve component reset is six and twelve months, respectively.

The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 3d Infantry Division, and more than 25 percent of Army Reserve units completed reset in FY 2005. The 4th Infantry Division, the 2d Light Cavalry Regiment, the 10th Mountain Division, the 1st Armored Division, the 76th Infantry Brigade (Indiana), the  30th  Infantry  Brigade  (North  Carolina),  the  82d Airborne Division, and the  101st Airborne  Division  were  in  various  stages  of  reset  by  the end of the fiscal year. Projections indicate that it will take up to two years after  the  return  of  forces  from  Iraq  and Afghanistan  to  completely  refit units and reconstitute equipment. To address this problem, Army planners continue to work on methods to streamline the process of returning units to readiness status at the end of a deployment.

## Management and Planning

A  memorandum of  agreement  signed  2 August  2004  by  the Army Materiel Command (AMC) Commanding General, Paul J. Kern, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology), Claude M. Bolton Jr., heralded a major new initiative for Army managed logistics.  The  Life  Cycle  Management  Command  (LCMC)  initiative integrates  AMC  major  subordinate  commands  and  their  associated Program  Executive  Officers  (PEOs)  under  a  single  commander  who will be the focal point and have primary responsibility for the entire life cycle of all systems assigned to the LCMC. The intent is to foster better

cooperation between supply officers and acquisition project managers and give AMC subordinate commands oversight over materiel during its entire term of use. Lt. Gen. Benjamin S. Griffin became commanding general of AMC in November 2004, and made the LCMC project a top priority.

Even before Griffin became the AMC commanding general, efforts were  underway  to  institute  the  LCMC  program.  On  5  October  2004, AMC established the Aviation and Missile LCMC at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. This LCMC, the Army's first, combined the Aviation and Missile Command and the Program Executive Officer Aviation. The PEO Tactical Missiles and PEO Air, Space, and Missile Defense were later merged into a single PEO Missile organization and added to the Aviation and Missile LCMC on 1 June 2005.

On  28  December  2004, Tank-Automotive  and Armaments  Command (TACOM) submitted a plan to AMC for a U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command. When referring to the LCMC community, 'TACOM' is  now  considered  a  standalone  proper  name  rather  than  the  acronym  that described the former Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command.

The Communications-Electronics (CECOM) Life Cycle Management Command,  began  on  2  February  2005.  It  manages  128  major  defense programs, amounting to over $10 billion in total obligation authority to acquire, field, and provide new equipment training. The CECOM LCMC team is responsible for almost half of the Army' s inventory of end items and spare parts. As a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure program, it is in the process of relocating to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. The move is scheduled to be completed by FY 2010.

The work of implementing the Joint Munitions and Lethality LCMC began  during  FY  2005.  However,  Congress  requested  that  the  Army evaluate  how  the  LCMC  should  be  structured  in  light  of  the  secretary of  defense  recommendation-endorsed  by  the  Base  Realignment  and Closure  Commission-that  Picatinny Arsenal,  New  Jersey,  become  the home for a joint integrated weapons and armaments specialty site for guns and ammunition. This change will delay the LCMC's formation until at least FY 2006.

In  order  to  present  a  single  AMC  face  to  supported  commanders, AMC began establishing Army  field  support  brigades  during  the  fiscal year. Each brigade is commanded by an AMC colonel who integrates the many capabilities of AMC and its partners in acquisition and contracting to provide unified, responsive support to field units. The first of these new brigades,  Army  Field  Support  Brigade-Europe,  formed  in  November 2004. By the end of FY 2005, AMC created a total of seven field support brigades as a part of the Army' s modularity transformation.

In an effort to modernize its information technology systems, AMC is developing a comprehensive Single Army Logistics Enterprise (SALE)

system  to  replace  current  logistics  automation  systems.  The  SALE enables operation of a Web-based logistics information system connecting soldiers in forward areas with not only supply points, but also materiel developers,  researchers,  and  industry  partners.  Three  ongoing  projects serve as the foundation for SALE: the Logistics Modernization Program, incorporating  fixed  maintenance  and  supply  installations;  the  Global Combat Support System Army, linking up troops in the field; and Product Life Cycle Management Plus system, serving as a single source of data for users along the entire supply chain. The Logistics Modernization Plan is the furthest along. The first implementation of the SALE at the national level  began  prior  to  FY  2005  with  pilot  implementations  at  CECOM, AMC headquarters, and the Defense Financial and Accounting Service. The SALE system is expected to be completed during FY 2007.

To  better  manage  logistics  within  the Army,  HQDA  and AMC  are considering a plan to transform the existing Army Field Support Command at Rock Island, Illinois, into the Army Sustainment Command (ASC). The ASC would serve as a centralized location for total life cycle management, contingency  contracting,  and  supply  and  maintenance  management, providing  standardized  logistical  support  to  soldiers  and  units  across the  Army.  Technology  figures  prominently  in  the  ASC  plan,  and  the SALE program is expected to obtain the means to create the computer architecture  necessary  for  the  proposed ASC  to  tie  together  the Army' s current logistical system.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

One  way  to  encourage  cutting-edge  technology  development  within the Army is to recognize the best Army inventions each year. This selection process is unique because the soldiers in the field provide their opinion to help identify the best new technologies provided to them. In FY 2005 the Army, from active duty divisions to the Training and Doctrine Command, chose the ten winning programs for their impact on Army capabilities, such as  breadth  of  use  and  magnitude  of  improvement  over  existing  systems, inventiveness, and potential benefit outside the Army. Included among the winners  were  a  new  combat  application  tourniquet,  a  fixed  site/vehicle mounted gunfire detection system, and several IED countermeasure devices.

The Army's Future Combat Systems program continued its development during  FY  2005.  Intended  to  be  a  fundamental  redesign  of  the  Army' s combat  force,  FCS  will  include  eighteen  new  manned  and  unmanned vehicles all connected by a single network. Designers of the new vehicle and weapon systems are called on to follow goals for weight, survivability, lethality, transportability, and maintainability that will enable them to deliver the striking power of heavy forces with the mobility of light forces.

S. Sgt. Thomas J. Brennan applies the 'Special Operations Forces Tactical Tourniquet,' the Army' s newest medical device, to Sgt. Sherrie M. Knight' s arm during a class at Camp Victory, Iraq, 19 July 2005. Designed for one-handed application, the tourniquet allows a soldier to apply it himself, replacing the Army' s field-expedient method in which soldiers used a bandage and a stick to stop blood flow from a wound.



Technical  challenges  for  FCS  development  mounted  in  FY  2005. The developers of the manned ground vehicles struggled to reach the key performance parameters associated with portability. Survivability concerns tended to increase vehicle weights too much to allow for their transport by a C-130, a key goal for the vehicles' designers. Increasingly powerful improvised explosive device attacks required armor and the incorporation of dead space, which increased the bulk of vehicles. By March 2005, the projected weight of manned ground vehicles in combat order rose to as high as 25 tons, up from the initial 19.5 ton target. At the same time, an April 2005 study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense by the Institute for Defense Analyses noted that current limits on vehicle weight to twenty short tons only improved transportability under a few conditions. If the Army  wanted  to  utilize  C-130  aircraft  it  would  need  an  even  lighter vehicle. The two choices are incompatible, but the designers of the FCS manned ground vehicles continue to search for a solution  to  the  issue. The current plan is to retain the weight limit specifications without armor, fuel, and ammunition. These will be transported separately and added to

the vehicles upon deployment. In FY 2006 research and development will continue to work out the weight and transportability issue.

In addition to these problems, members of Congress objected to the FCS  program's  management  structures.  Congressional  critics  disliked both the Lead System Integrator method of management and the Other Transaction  Authority  contracting  system  because  of  what  they  saw as  a  lack  of  accountability.  The  Other Transaction Authority  exempted companies that are not traditional defense suppliers from the Pentagon' s labyrinthine acquisition regulations. Congress,  however,  argued  that this  system created a process that could too easily foster corruption. In deference to these concerns, on 9 May 2005, Assistant Secretary Bolton directed the program to convert its Lead Systems Integration agreement with  the  Boeing  Company  from  an  Other  Transaction  Authority  to  a Federal  Acquisition  Regulation-based  contract.  Bolton  maintained  that the new contracting system would be better as FCS grew in size and the program's details became clearer.

Despite these problems the FCS program reached a key decision in FY 2005. In August the Army announced that the Detroit Diesel Company had been awarded the contract, valued at $47 million, to produce the engine for the FCS family of manned ground vehicles. The company will deliver twelve 5L890 engines in mid-2006, with an option for thirty-five more. Designers for the manned ground vehicles that will use the engine can now proceed with development based upon the new engine specifications.

With the end of FY 2005, the FCS Unit of Action program and the Program Manager, Unit of Action, assumed a new name, Future Combat Systems (Brigade Combat Team), as it had taken on a new role. General Schoomaker's  modularity  initiative  made  the  brigade  combat  team  the basic tactical unit of the Army, and the program name became obsolete. This symbolized that FCS planners would adapt to the shift to a brigadebased force under the Army' s modularity program.

As a whole, the FCS program passed a series of reviews during the fiscal year. The first, conducted by the Defense Acquisition Board in June 2005, focused on costs and confirmed the program office's estimates of costs  of  $161.4  billion.  In  early  August,  an  Army  System-of-Systems Functional Review conducted five days of inspections at twenty-four sites, examining progress toward resolution of technical and doctrinal issues and identified requirements for design of an FCS Unit of Action. Though all of  the  programs  reviewed  had  faced  difficulties,  the  reviewers  certified that the FCS program remained on track and could commence preliminary design of the Future Combat Systems.

The  Joint  Tactical  Radio  system,  a  program  related  to  FCS,  also experienced problems during FY 2005. Designed to be the Army's next generation  software-programmable  radio  for  ground  and  aerial  units,

the Army issued a partial stop-work order in January and halted initial production of the Joint Tactical Radio System. The move came about due to rising technical issues and security concerns over the radio' s design. In an effort to rectify these continuing problems the program was restructured in March to add a Joint Program Executive Office that would provide a unified management structure to coordinate development of the four radio versions.

Instituted  in  September  2003,  the  Rapid  Fielding  Initiative  (RFI) addresses in-theater capability deficiencies as quickly as possible in order to maintain individual and unit effectiveness. AMC maintains an RFI list of  items  that  every  soldier  and  unit  must  have  and  then  determines  the fastest method for keeping them outfitted. The most common solution is to purchase goods commercially rather than rely on traditional supply systems. The  RFI  leverages  current  programs,  lessons  learned  from  operations in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  and  commercial-off-the-shelf  technology  to increase the survivability, lethality, and mobility of soldiers. The RFI list of equipment issued to soldiers is updated regularly by the Training and Doctrine Command to maintain relevance. The list includes two types of equipment: equipment every soldier receives (such as helmets, clothing items, and hydration systems) and equipment fielded to units. Although all  organizations  receive  certain  unit  equipment,  a  more  expansive  list is  provided  to  brigade  combat  teams  and  other  selected  organizations identified by Headquarters, Department of the Army, to include lethality and specialty items, such as weapons optics and military operations on urban terrain kits. In parallel, PEO Soldier also fields a variety of other items essential to readiness that are not RFI items, such as interceptor body armor, thermal weapon sights, night vision goggles, multiband inter-/intrateam radio, and ACU items. The RFI equipment list has grown from an initial eighteen items to forty-nine items in FY 2005 and outfitted 448,647 soldiers, just missing its goal of 449,426.

Since its  inception  in  November  2002,  the  Rapid  Equipping  Force  (REF) has operated as a means of bypassing traditional research, development, and  acquisition  procedures  to  meet  current Army  equipment  needs.  In contrast to the RFI' s system of providing soldiers and units with a set list of  equipment,  the  REF  addresses Army-wide,  systemic  deficiencies  by providing immediate technology solutions. The REF provides Army units at the brigade, battalion, and company levels that are deployed globally with specialized and specific capabilities materiel quickly to prevent a loss in overall unit capabilities. To do this the REF identifies an immediate need, seeks out the best way to meet it, and quickly gets the technical solution to soldiers, sometimes as rapidly as forty-eight hours. The REF focuses on commercial off-the-shelf or government off-the-shelf solutions, as well as some rapid prototyping, in order to get capabilities to soldiers as quickly as

possible, while observing Army and Defense Department acquisition laws and regulations. A staff support agency under the Army G-3/5/7, HQDA, located at Fort Belvoir, the REF serves as a solutions catalyst, canvassing the military, industry, academia, and the science community for existing and emerging technologies. In its most impressive achievement, the REF supplied over thirty small, wheeled robots with a video camera able to check for improvised explosive devices to Iraq and Afghanistan, allowing troops to keep a safe distance from the devices.

The Army also continued to improve its efforts to provide upgraded equipment to soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to the rising threat posed by improvised explosive devices, the Army sought to  armor  high-mobility,  multipurpose  wheeled  vehicles  and  to  provide armor  for  every  vehicle  to  operate  off-base.  The  Army  made  progress in achieving these goals in FY 2005, as well as providing equipment for increased personnel survivability ( Table 8 ).

In March 2005, the  Army selected the XM320 40-mm. grenade launcher, developed  by  Heckler  &amp;  Koch  Defense,  to  replace  the  M203  40-mm. grenade launcher. Laboratory and field tests began shortly thereafter with a goal for replacing the M203 starting in the summer of 2006.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Total  appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund support to Army Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  programs  (fitness,  sports,  recreation, library,  and  youth  pro  grams,  and  child  development  services)  for  FY 2005 amounted to $1.52 billion. Nonappropriated revenue totaled $910.6 million and field activities' net income before depreciation equaled $104.5 million. Morale, welfare, and recreation programs received $605 million in  appropriated  support  (including  military  con  struction).  In  addition, morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  facilities  operated  at  twenty-five  large and  twenty-two  small  sites  in  Iraq,  four  major  and  five  remote  sites  in Afghanistan, and one major and five small sites in Kuwait.

## Installation Management

During FY 2005 the  Army began implementing a new policy for funding installations. The Army leadership set a goal of funding installations at an annual rate of 90 percent for sustainment, restoration, and modernization as well as base operations services. The policy increases overall funding for installations, with funds taken from other parts of the budget as the Army identifies  programs  failing  in  execution  during  its  annual  budget review. The new program promises to provide more predictable funding levels that will enable garrison commanders greater control in managing their communities. The Army Budget Office will distribute the funds in phases through the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management and the Installation Management Agency. The Installation Management Agency will institute an annual funding program in subsequent years.

In addition, on 8 July 2005, Secretary Harvey and General Schoomaker signed the U.S. Army Energy Strategy for Installations and approved the U.S. Army Energy and Water Campaign Plan for Installations. These new initiatives created the foundation for a new plan to provide reliable, costeffective,  and  environmentally  compliant  energy  and  water  services  to Army installations. The plan set forth five major initiatives by which the Army hoped to achieve these goals: eliminating energy waste in existing facilities, increasing efficiency through new constructions and renovations,

reducing  dependence  on  fossil  fuels,  conserving  water  resources,  and improving  energy  security. The  new  campaign  plan  went  into  effect  at the end of the fiscal year and will be evaluated in subsequent years for modification and adjustment.

## Housing and Infrastructure

The  Army continued to implement its Residential Communities Initiative and Barracks Modernization Program, which focus mainly on privatization and  modernization.  In  FY  2005  the  Army' s  privatization  projects  met their goals by improving 4,272 housing units from inadequate to adequate (2,409 renovations, 1,863 new constructions). By the end of FY 2005 the Army privatized over 59,000 units since the program began.  In the coming years it will privatize 24,000 more. Additionally, the Army completed the renovations and modernization of 8,204 barracks spaces in FY 2005.

## Safety

The Army had 2,440 Class A, Class B, and Class C accidents in FY 2005. Ground accidents accounted for 2,224 of these, of which 276 were Class A accidents (damages of $1 million or more; destruction of military aircraft, injury resulting in a fatality or permanent total disability).  Aviation accidents totaled 216, of which 31 were Class A accidents.

The Army lost  299  soldiers  from  accidents  in  FY  2005,  compared to 264 in FY 2004. Aviation accidents resulted in the loss of thirty-four soldiers, up from twelve the previous year. Ground accidents killed 265 soldiers, with 107 occurring on duty and 158 occurring off duty. Fiftyfour percent of accidental deaths came as the result of incidents involving personally  owned  vehicles,  19  percent  involved  armored  motorized vehicles, and 18 percent were categorized as personal-injury deaths such as training and recreational accidents.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

In FY 2005, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service returned $229 million  to  the  services'  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  programs. This repre  sented an average per capita dividend of $234 for every soldier and airman. The Army received $139.1 million from the dividend.

The exchange program provided support to joint and coalition forces serving in Operations joInt Forge  joInt guardIan  IraqI Freedom, , , and endurIng Freedom, to  include  the  Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa. It operated sixty-two contingency exchanges and supported thirtynine imprest fund activities in the theater of operations. During the year

the  exchange  averaged  490  volunteers  assisting  ongoing  contingency operations.

Also in FY 2005, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service introduced the  'Help  Our  Troops  Call  Home'  program,  which  assisted  American citizens  in  expressing  their  support  for  deployed  service  members. The program allowed any American to purchase a pre  paid phone card at www. aafes.com for delivery to service members serving in OEF or OIF. By the end of the fiscal year 135,176 phone cards had been purchased. There is a similar link on the exchange' s Web site for the purchase of gift certificates that can be redeemed in any exchange around the world.

The exchange service also deployed personnel in support of noncombat operations, military exercises, and natural disaster relief operations. In FY 2005 it supported Exercise new horIzons in Panama and Nicaragua, as well as Exercise brIght star in Egypt. It responded to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by placing Tactical Field Exchanges in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, which served soldiers and airmen deployed in disaster relief opera  tions.  The first  Tactical Field Exchange became operational at Keesler Air  Force  Base,  Mississippi,  forty-eight  hours  after  Katrina  passed. At the  height  of  these  efforts,  the  exchange  service  had  six Tactical  Field Exchanges in op  eration assisting service members and relief workers at various locations.

An FY 2005 market basket survey, a systematic study of the twenty to forty different foods most people have in their diet, indicated that the Army and Air Force Exchange Service customers regularly save an average of 22 percent  on  the  typical  military  family' s  basic,  everyday  necessities.  By including sales tax relief, the savings increases to 28 percent.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

On 16 May 2005, John Paul Woodley Jr. became Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) following his confirmation by the Senate. Mr. Woodley had been serving as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) from 9 December 2004 until this appointment. Prior to this, he served as the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) from 22 August 2003 until 8 December 2004, when his recess appointment concluded.

The  Civil  Works  Program  mission  is  four-fold:  to  contribute  to the  national  welfare  and  serve  the  public  by  providing  the  nation  and the Army  with  quality, responsive development  and  management of  the  nation' s  water  resources;  to  protect,  restore,  and  manage  the environment; to respond to and recover from disasters; and to provide engineering and technical services. The mission is to be accomplished in an environmentally sustainable, economic, and technically sound manner through  partnerships  with  government  agencies  and  nongovernment organizations. In FY 2005, the Corps of Engineers signed three records of  decision,  completed  five  remedial  investigations,  removed  243,000 cubic  yards  of  contaminated  material,  and  returned  five  individual properties to beneficial use.

## Base Realignment and Closure

The Defense Department released the preliminary 2005 Base Realignment and Closure list on 13 May 2005.  The fifth proposal generated since  the  process  began  in  1988,  it  recommended  closing  thirty-three major U.S. military bases (including fourteen Army bases) and realigning (either  by  enlargement  or  reduction)  twenty-nine  others.  Included  in  the realignment recommendations were the transfer of Army Human Resources Command and the U.S. Army Armor School to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and Fort  Benning,  Georgia,  respectively.  President  George W .  Bush  approved the recommendations  on  15 September. Congressman  Ray  LaHood (R-Ill.) introduced a joint resolution (H.J. 65) to consider the proposal on 23 September. The Senate did not take up a corresponding resolution. Debate is to begin in FY 2006.

Rumsfeld, center , Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Michael Wynne, left , and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Richard B. Myers, right , swear in prior to testifying before a Senate committee about the Defense Department's Base Realignment and Closure recommendations at the Senate Hart Building in Washington, D.C., 16 May 2005.



## Environmental Protection

The Army spent $401 million on environmental restoration in FY 2005. In October 2004 the Army announced the Army Strategy for the Environment, mandating that the Army change how it communicates with  the  general  public,  the  business  community,  and  government agencies. To facilitate this process, the Army launched the Army Public Involvement  Toolbox  Web  site  to  provide  information  on  specific public  involvement  activities,  locate  training  opportunities,  find  the latest regulations and policy statements, and link to resources created by other agencies.

Ten  military  installations  and  one  individual  were  honored  by the  2004  Secretary  of  Defense  Annual  Environmental  Awards  in  a ceremony at the Pentagon on 4 May 2005. Among those honored were Fort Drum, New York, which received the award for Large InstallationNatural Resource Conservation, and Lt. Col. Michael Tarpley, Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, who received the award for Individual-Cultural Resources Management.

## Legal Affairs

A  significant  caseload  increase  in  FY  2005  kept  nineteen  active duty military judges, one mobilized Army Reserve military judge, and fourteen Reserve military judges not on active duty busy presiding over all special and general courts-martial worldwide ( Table 9 ). Army judges tried over fifteen hundred original trials and DuBay hearings (hearings to  determine  issues  raised  collaterally  which  require  findings  of  fact and conclusions of law), the most since FY 1992. To equalize travel and workload among the circuits, the Army realigned its six judicial circuits. It held 141 trials in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq, increasing the number of cases tried in hostile-fire pay zones to nearly 300 since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism.

BCD = Bad Conduct Discharge

The  U.S.  Army  Government  Appellate  Division  filed  1,059  final briefs with the Army Court of Criminal Appeals and 17 with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. It also worked to reduce the backlog of 529 cases pending before the Army Court by instituting a twice-a-month 'Knock Out a Brief Day' program, resulting in the completion of 157 cases, leaving 372 cases in need of briefing.

Members of the  Trial Counsel  Assistance Program served as prosecutors in  several  high-profile  cases.  As  a  part  of  the  Government  Appellate Division, the program linked trial counsel and appellate counsel together to  resolve  issues  of  common  importance  to  the  successful  prosecution of  courts-martial.  It  aided  in  the  successful  prosecution  of  Sgt.  Hasan Akbar, securing a conviction and sentence of death after his trial for the 2003 murder of two officers and wounding of fourteen soldiers at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait. The group also provided aid in prisoner abuse cases emerging from Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Bagram in Afghanistan.

In  FY  2005  the  Army  imposed  nonjudicial  punishment  in  45,299 cases.  This  represented  an  increase  of  8.2  percent  over  the  previous

year, and a rate of 91.9 per 1,000 soldiers. The U.S. Army Trial Defense Service provided professional defense counsel in 36,216 cases involving nonjudicial  punishment,  as  well  as  885  administrative  boards,  and  all special and general courts-martial.

During FY 2005 the Defense Appellate Division received 959 new cases. It also filed briefs in 907 cases before the Army Court of Appeals, 330 supplements to petitions for review with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and 14 final briefs with the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Appellate defense counsel also filed 316 miscellaneous motions before the Army Court of Appeals and 87 miscellaneous pleadings before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, as well as arguing 21 and 35 cases before the two courts, respectively.

Finally, the Army' s stop-loss policy survived several legal challenges in FY 2005. Instituted in 1983, the statute enables the president to suspend the laws relating to separation of any member of the armed forces under specified conditions of national emergency. It has been utilized since 2002 as a means of maintaining available soldiers and reservists to meet the challenges faced with increased commitments in the Global War on Terrorism. In three cases ( Doe v. Rumsfeld , Qualls v. Rumsfeld ,  and Santiago v. Rumsfeld )  the  presiding judge, the District Court, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Army's position that the policy of involuntary extensions of service did not violate the contract signed by either active duty or reserve soldiers due to the national emergency declared by President Bush after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.

## Army Audit Agency

During FY 2005 the Army Audit Agency produced 333 reports on inspections, reviews, and follow ups conducted by its agents. The most significant  findings  became  a  part  of  the  semiannual  reports  by  the Department of Defense Inspector General's office. They report that:

The  Army's  process  for  transferring  soldiers  from  active  duty  to  the Individual  Ready  Reserve  proved  ineffective  due  to  the  information  on Individual Ready Reserve soldiers not being transferred between personnel systems.  Additionally,  transition  center  personnel  selected  the  wrong separation circumstances in the personnel system. The Army also did not have  information  needed  to  mobilize  16,589  Individual  Ready  Reserve soldiers  because  their  automated  records  lacked  information,  such  as correct address.

The Army  made  progress  in  its  efforts  to  consolidate  information technology servers to improve security, but more remained to be done.

Installations used various methods to implement the program, producing mixed results. All HQDA functional proponents, major commands, and Installation Directors of Information Management received guidance that established  a  goal,  an  initial  milestone,  and  a  database  to  report  server consolidation  progress,  but  the  Army  needs  to  redefine  the  guidance, implementation process, and procedures for server consolidation.

In  addition,  the  Army' s  System-of-Systems  Architecture  database did  not  provide  accurate  funding,  expenditures,  or  requirements  data for  each  personnel  information  technology  system  under  the  Human Resources Command. The database could provide information necessary for  Army  leaders  to  make  management,  prioritization,  and  budget decisions, yet it still needed improvement to account for all personnel systems, applications, reports, extracts, and databases within the Army personnel community.

In regard to acquisition process and contract management, the Army had  no  assurance  that  contractor  performance  met  expectations  for  the Logistics  Civil  Augmentation  Program  in  Kuwait  because  of  a  failure to follow  performance-based  contract  procedures,  prepare  recurring reports and support plans from the contractor, properly delegate contract administrative authority to the Defense Contract Management Agency, or develop standard operating procedures for the Logistics Civil  Augmentation Program Support Unit. Additionally, the Army did not adequately account for  $77  million  worth  of  government-furnished  property  the  contractor used to support contract task orders for the program in Southeast Asia, cost estimates for the task order statements of work received were overstated by at least $40 million, and the contractor incurred about $1.7 million in value-added taxes that did not apply to the Army.

The Army Environmental Database-Restoration Requirements showed that the original Army Environmental Database included the majority of applicable  financial  functional  requirements,  as  required  by  the  Federal Financial  Management  Improvement  Act,  and  additional  requirements would  be  included  in  the  next  system  upgrade.  However,  an  internal control  issue  arose  concerning  the  overall  reporting  of  environmental liabilities  because  the  database  did  not  interface  with  any  financial system. Additionally,  a  review  of  Environmental  and  Explosives  Safety Requirements for Weapons Systems showed that only one out of the five systems reviewed had effectively integrated environmental management into the system development process.

Army  medical  activities  generally  used  Global  War  on  Terrorism funds appropriately and properly recorded and accounted for the majority  of  transactions  using  these  funds.  However,  the  operating personnel  sometimes  did  not  interpret  or  follow  published  U.S.  Army Medical Command guidance on a regular basis. As a result, the medical

activities  were  reimbursed  about  $4.8  million  for  unsupported  Global War on Terrorism expenditures while other valid costs were not captured. Additionally,  about  $14.3  million  in  transactions  contained  errors  that needed correction.

The Army properly secured and accounted for seized cash and metal bars in Operation IraqI Freedom ,  but  numerous noncash assets remained unaccounted for and in some instances unprotected.  The Comptroller' s Office, Coalition Provisional Authority, did not perform required reconciliations on its account balances for vested and seized assets with Defense Finance and Accounting Services and Department of Treasury records. Additionally, the Army did not maintain a filing area with reasonable access to the official documents  that  support  disbursements  from  the  vested  and  seized  asset accounts. Despite this, evidence showed transactions using vested and seized assets were for the benefit of the Iraqi people.

## 9 Conclusion

Fiscal  year  2005  marked  a  continuation  of  the  major  trends  and initiatives  undertaken  by  the  Army  as  it  continued  to  fight  the  Global War on Terrorism. The service maintained large combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and continued its efforts to protect the homeland. Simultaneously, transformation touched all parts of the Army, particularly in the shift to a modular force of brigade combat teams. The continued development of the Future Combat Systems initiative, the implementation of the Lean Six Sigma methodology, and the development of new training regimens for officers and enlisted personnel advanced the Army' s overall effort to reform the force to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. The goal remained to create a flexible, robust force of soldiers possessing the basic combat skills necessary to achieve victory over multiple enemies. At the same time, the force needed to be efficient with American blood and treasure, as well as appreciative of the impact that multiple deployments put on soldiers and their families. The Army, therefore, made strides to improve  soldier  survivability,  to  streamline  logistical  support,  and  to provide soldiers with the training and institutional support to allow them to  maintain  the  highest  standards  without  breaking  under  the  strain  of continued and varied operations.
