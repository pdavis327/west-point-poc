## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2007

## 1 Introduction

Changes and challenges characterized fiscal year (FY) 2007 for the United States Army  as  it  fought  two  major  conflicts,  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan,  and prepared for the future through modernization and transformation. While Army leaders continued  to  prosecute  the Global  War  on  T errorism  (GWOT), they also emphasized recruiting, maintaining,  and  supporting  soldiers and their families who were stretched and stressed by the demands of repeated deployments and limited recovery  time.  By  the  summer  of 2007,  the  U.S.  Army  was  'out  of balance,' according to its new chief of staff, and 'consumed' with meeting its current  demands  at  an  unsustainable tempo of deployments. To regain balance, Army leaders sought to better prepare soldiers for combat, reset the forces  after  deployments,  transform to  meet  future  demands,  and  sustain the Army' s soldiers, families, and civilians.

The Army experienced a number of staff and organizational changes during FY 2007. The former commander of  the  Multi-National  Force-Iraq,  General  George  W .  Casey  Jr.,  became the Army chief of staff in April, and a few months later, Preston M. 'Pete' Geren III became secretary of the Army, having been the acting secretary since March 2007. The new U.S. Army Africa began its mission as part of the United States Africa Command on 1 October 2007. It was the newest of six unified commands in the Department of Defense command structure. The Army also changed its logistical structure with several organizational changes and established a new theater signal command in the United States as well.

The  Army's  FY  2007  budget  proposal  emphasized  manning  the force,  supporting  soldiers  and  families,  and  sustaining  the  quality  of Army  personnel.  Key  features  of the  Army's  planning  and  financial emphasis included the Future Combat  Systems  (FCS)  program and the continued development of  the  new  modular  force,  which was  designed  to  create  brigadebased units for expeditions and campaigns.

Preparing Army units for overseas  duty  was  the  catalyst  for the  new  Army  Force  Generation (ARFORGEN) model,  which  provided  for  recurring  availability  of units  for  operational  deployment. Simultaneously,  the  Army  worked to identify, recruit, and retain high quality soldiers. To sustain the force,  the  Army  spent  significant resources  to  upgrade  installations, facilities,  and  family  housing  and developed  plans  to  continue  these efforts into the future.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Reorganizations and Realignments

Several  major  organizational  changes  within  the  Army' s  structure occurred in FY 2007. In October 2006, Fifth United States Army became U.S. Army North and assumed America' s homeland defense mission, which included support for federal, state, and local civil authorities during times of crisis, and security cooperation activities with Canada and Mexico. The creation of U.S. Army North was part of the Army' s ongoing transformation process, an effort to adapt the headquarters command structure to execute Military Department Title 10 functions more efficaciously. The command, based at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, served as the Army service component of  U.S.  Northern  Command.  In  addition,  U.S.  Army  North  assumed responsibility  for  the  training  and  readiness  of  Civil  Support  Response Teams, National Guard units dedicated to weapons of mass destruction and disaster response missions.

The  newly  organized  United  States  Army  Installation  Management Command  (IMCOM)  began  operations  on  24  October  2006,  under  the leadership of Lt. Gen. Robert Wilson. Its purpose was to reduce bureaucracy, apply a uniform business structure to manage U.S.  Army installations, sustain the  environment,  and  enhance  the  well-being  of  the  military  community. IMCOM consolidated the Installation Management Agency, the Community and Family Support Center, and the Army Environmental Center under a single command as a direct reporting unit. Before the genesis of IMCOM, one of the Army' s fifteen major commands managed 184 installations. In November 2006, in  a  consolidation  of  two  subordinate  offices,  IMCOM activated  IMCOM-West at Fort Sam Houston. The following month, the Installation Management Command announced the Installation Management Study, a blueprint for IMCOM to fit seamlessly into the Army' s structure and to strengthen installation support services to soldiers and their families. In  2007,  IMCOM created  thirty-five Warrior Transition  Units,  to  deliver support to families and soldiers at Army garrisons.

Furthering  the  Army' s  restructuring  efforts,  in  November  2006, Secretary of the Army Francis J. Harvey approved redefining the service' s

major command headquarters and  aligning  each  based  on  new definitions  and  their  relationships with Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA). Harvey approved several new definitions:

- ·	Army	 Command:	 an	 Army force, designated by the Army secretary, which performs multiple Army  Service  Title  10  functions across multiple disciplines. The command responsibilities are set by the Army secretary.
- ·	Army Service Component Command: an Army force comprised primarily of operational organizations serving as the Army component of a combatant  command  or  sub-unified command.
- ·	Direct	 reporting	 unit	 (DRU):	 an	Army	 organization	 comprised	 of one  or  more  units  with  institutional  or  operational  support  functions, normally to provide broad general support to the Army in a single, unique discipline, not otherwise available in the Army. DRUs report directly to an Army headquarters principal and/or Army Command, and operate under authorities established by the Army secretary.

Secretary Harvey



Under the secretary' s restructuring scheme, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S.  Army  Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  and  U.S.  Army  Materiel Command (AMC) became known as Army Commands. The nine Army components of the worldwide combatant commands were to be described as Army Service Component Commands. Direct reporting units, such as U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, U.S. Army Medical Command, and U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command comprised a further headquarters.

In a significant change  to  the  Army's  logistics  structure,  in January  2007  the  Military  Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution Command (SDDC) became  a  major  subordinate  command  of Army Materiel  Command,  headquartered  at  Scott Air  Force  Base,  Illinois. Previously,  the  Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution  Command  had been a major Army command reporting to the Department of the Army. SDDC remained the Army service component command of the U.S. Transportation Command, with the responsibility for coordinating all

surface movement of Department of Defense assets and the operation of twenty-four seaports. As  a  result,  the  SDDC  became the single Army  integrator of logistics, managing  the  Army's logistical  distribution  and  troop transportation efforts from the United States to deployed theater support commands.

On 7 February 2007, President George  W.  Bush  announced  that he had directed the Defense Department to develop and stand up a unified command for Africa. The  new  command  was  one  of six unified geographic commands within the Department of Defense organization. General William E. 'Kip' Ward became the

General Ward



first  commander  of  U.S. Africa  Command  (AFRICOM)  in  Stuttgart, Germany, on 1 October 2007. The new organization covered the entire African  continent  except  Egypt,  which  continued  to  fall  under  U.S. Central  Command.  AFRICOM's  purpose  was  to  oversee  security cooperation with African allies, nonmilitary operations, and, if needed,  military  operations  as  well.  For  its  first  year,  the  command existed as a subcommand of U.S. European Command, with a separate headquarters. On 1 October 2008, the command separated from U.S. European Command and began operating as a full-fledged combatant command.

Reorganization during FY 2007 also included the Army's efforts to  use  its  past  experiences  to  enhance  its  training,  education,  esprit de corps, and decision making in the present and future. Accordingly, the  U.S.  Army  Center  of  Military  History  (CMH),  located  at  Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C., moved from under the auspices of the Director of the Army Staff to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, effective 14 March 2007. The Center  of  Military  History  remained  responsible  for  the  appropriate use  of  history  throughout  the  United  States Army.  Formed  in  1945, CMH provides  historical  support  to  the Army  Secretariat  and  Staff, and contributes essential background information for decision making, staff  actions,  command information programs, and public statements by Army officials.

At the end of the fiscal year, the Army announced plans to establish a  new  theater  signal  command  within  the  continental  United  States, headquartered at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Headed by a three-star general and designated as 7th Signal Command, the organization was responsible for command and control of the Continental United States LandWarNet, the infrastructure and services that allow the Army to collect, process, store, disseminate,  and  manage  information  on  demand  for  users;  defending homeland-based, information-enabled operations; and synchronizing network  operations  in  the  Continental  United  States.  The  7th  Signal Command became   one of five theater Signal Commands worldwide, and a subordinate element of the Army' s NETCOM/9th Signal Command.

## Management

The Army continued to emphasize Lean Six Sigma methodology in its  'Business Transformation' efforts to seek process refinement, waste reduction, and quality improvement, in order to free manpower and money for more pressing operational needs. From these initiatives, the Army also sought reduced costs. Based on the Toyota Production System, Lean Six Sigma techniques as implemented throughout the Army proved successful and produced an estimated cost savings of $2 billion by 2007. A number of Army organizations continued to use this methodology in FY 2007. One noteworthy example is the Army Materiel Command, which earned twelve Shingo Prizes presented for continuous improvement through employee empowerment and effective leadership. The Central Issue Facility of Fort Bragg,  North  Carolina,  a  one-stop  equipment  and  clothing  outlet  for soldiers, reduced issue and turn-in times by 50 percent and its inventory by more than 65 percent. Fort Bragg officials projected a 20 percent cost savings by October 2007. Employees at the Red River Army Depot, Texas, focused Lean Six Sigma techniques on projects involving the production of the M2 Bradley fighting vehicle to realize almost $600,000 in savings. Fuel-recycling initiatives at Red River Depot also saved more than thirtyseven  thousand  gallons  of  fuel,  with  a  value  of  approximately  $85,000 in FY 2007. The depot also saved more than $19 million after a program aligning two process-improvement activities helped eliminate waste and reduced variation in business and industrial processes.

With regard to Army personnel issues, plans continued for the rollout of  the  congressionally  mandated  Defense  Integrated  Military  Human Resources System. This was the largest finance reorganization since the creation  of  the  paymaster  general  of  the Army  at  the  beginning  of  the American Revolution. The system attempted to  transfer  all  payroll  and personnel functions to Human Resources Command, with a planned rollout date of August 2008. The system utilized PeopleSoft commercial software

to integrate ninety automated systems across the Department of Defense and was intended to provide soldiers with secure, Web-based self-service options such as leave and earnings statement access, initiating requests for assignments, and requesting various forms, all without having to see a personnel specialist.

## Budget

The Army's FY 2007 budget mirrored General Casey's priorities by emphasizing  manning  the  force,  taking  care  of  soldiers  and  families, and  sustaining  the  quality of  Army  personnel.  For  operations  and maintenance, the Army sought funding for combined arms training, the Baseline  Depot  Maintenance  Program,  commitments  to  improve  base support and sustainment, as well as ongoing peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. Additionally, the Army relied on supplemental budget requests for Operations I raqi F reedom (OIF) and E nduring F reedom (oeF) .

The  budget  reflected  a  2.2  percent  across-the-board  pay  raise  for active and reserve military personnel, with selective additional increases for certain warrant officers and mid-grade senior enlisted personnel. There was also a 2.2 percent pay raise for Department of the Army civilians.

The operations and maintenance section of the Army budget supported readiness objectives by funding institutional training, mobilization operations, installation management, and recruiting missions.  The FY 2007 budget also supported the Army' s war fighting readiness through training, mobility,  and  sustainment  programs,  and  sought  to  provide  adequate levels of funding for the maintenance of weapon systems, equipment, and infrastructure. The research and development funds in the FY 2007 budget emphasized the Future Combat Systems program, the Joint Tactical Radio System, and continued development and demonstration activities for the Patriot/Medium  Extended  Air  Defense  System  Combined  Aggregate Program.

The Army's FY 2007 procurement budget contained funding for the development of the Army modular force, including more than $5 billion for equipment required to allow soldiers to operate in the new modular brigade combat teams. The budget projected additional funds for  new  aircraft,  including  Black  Hawk,  armed  reconnaissance,  and light utility helicopters, as well as new and remanufactured Chinook cargo helicopters. The delivery of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP)  vehicles  to  deployed  troops  received  significant  financial emphasis. Secretary  of  Defense  Robert  M.  Gates  asked  Congress  in July for approval to shift an additional $1.2 billion from other defense programs to the MRAP effort, which meant an MRAP budget of $5.4 billion for FY 2007.

MRAP vehicles



Military construction funds in the budget were intended to improve facilities  across  the Army  by  making  barracks  renewal  a  top  priority. This allocation also supported transformation and readiness by creating facilities for training and deployment, revitalizing infrastructure, and  providing  Reserve  Component  readiness  facilities.  The  active component military construction budget furnished projects to upgrade the  quality  of  life  of  soldiers  and  families,  improve  readiness,  and support transformation. New  facilities included modern  barracks, training ranges, and physical fitness centers.

In the Army's budget, research, development, and acquisition (RDA) included both $75 billion in procurement appropriations and $69 billion  in  research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation  appropriations. The RDA budget balanced the needs of the forces fighting the war with modernizing  and  recapitalizing  the  force  for  future  challenges,  and supported  investigating,  acquiring,  and  fielding  technical  and  materiel solutions  as  quickly  as  possible  to  meet  soldiers'  needs  in  the  field.  In addition to Future Combat Systems, the FY 2007 budget sought to allow the Army to progress with the delivery of the first iterations of the new Battle Command Control Network, with Unattended Ground Sensors and Intelligent Munition Systems and the Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System. For the entire Defense Department, from FY 2000 to FY 2007, research development, test,  and  evaluation  funds  increased  by  nearly  72  percent

and  procurement  increased  by  110  percent  in  constant  dollars,  figures that include supplemental funds. RDA funding for the Army in FY 2007 was $11.3 billion, down from $11.7 billion in FY 2006 ( Table 1 ). Army procurement funds totaled $48.6 billion, an increase from $28.2 billion in the previous fiscal year.

Financially, FY 2007 was challenging. The bulk of the Army's funds was spent to sustain its people, maintain vital infrastructure, and prepare equipment for combat deployment. ( See Table 2. )  As a result of these costs, the Army's  ability  to  fund  its  investment  accounts  was  limited.  Budget shortfalls led the Army to announce on 16 April that spending restrictions were  necessary  while  it  waited  for  Congress  to  pass  an  emergency supplemental  budget  request  to  fund  GWOT  requirements.  Funds  for operations and maintenance ran low during this time, requiring reductions in other areas to ensure funds were available to execute the Army' s mission of defending the nation and prosecuting the Global War on Terrorism while continuing to support military families.

By the end of the fiscal year, the Army's top civilian and military leaders  informed  Congress  they  needed  continued  and  uninterrupted support to  maintain  current  operational  levels  while  preparing  for  the future.  General Casey outlined four imperatives for the House Armed

Services Committee, which he said were critical to the Army's ability to  restore  balance  and  maintain  the  all-volunteer  force:  improving  the way  the  Army  sustained  soldiers,  families,  and  civilians;  preparing troops for success in the current conflict; resetting troops and equipment for future deployments; and transforming the force for the twenty-first century.  General  Casey  further  stressed  the  need  for  fielding  the  best new equipment to the fighting forces, incorporating new techniques, and deploying the Army's Future Combat Systems to brigade combat teams to ensure that the Army has a decisive advantage on the battlefield. Casey also urged House Armed Services Committee members to support these initiatives into FY 2008 and to avoid a funding gap after 1 October 2007, which had the potential to slow military efforts then under way. Secretary Geren noted in his testimony to the same congressional committee that the Army's focus had shifted away from the pay issues that dominated the 1970s and housing issues of the 1990s. Rather, the current emphasis focused  on  taking  care  of  Army  families,  particularly  with  regard  to long deployments of service members. Casey echoed these remarks, and stressed  'resetting  the  force,'  by  which  he  meant  giving  soldiers  and their families time to regroup between deployments.

In  February  2007,  President  Bush  delivered  his  FY  2008  defense budget request and FY 2007 emergency supplemental funding request to Congress. The 2008 proposal called for a 3 percent pay raise for service members,  an  increase  in  ground  forces,  and  continued  funding  of  the Global War on Terrorism. The request aimed to improve readiness through additional  training  and  maintenance  and  by  resetting  forces  following overseas deployments. Bush's budget called for the Army to receive $130.1 billion in FY 2008, an increase of more than 20 percent. The Army' s Future Combat Systems would receive $3.7 billion in research and development funds. The Army asked for slightly more than $24 billion in procurement dollars for aircraft purchases, combat and support vehicles, and weapons, including  70,000  M4  carbine  rifles  and  more  than  8,300  M249  squad automatic weapons.

The  president's  emergency  supplemental  request  for  FY  2007 was  set  at  $93.4  billion,  with  $39.3  billion  going  to  war  fighting, supplies,  support,  and  maintenance.  It  also  sought  $10.4  billion  to defeat  improvised  explosive  devices.  Under  the  proposal,  the  active Army would  grow  to  547,400  soldiers  by  the  end  of  FY  2012,  and give soldiers two years at their home stations for every year deployed. By  July,  Secretary  Gates  planned  revisions  to  the  FY  2008  budget requests  to  account  for  new  requirements,  including  the  purchase  of new MRAP vehicles, which was expected to cost at least $10 billion. Gates approved a plan to increase production of MRAPs to a monthly rate of 1,300 vehicles by December 2008.

## Personnel

## Army Strength and Distribution

The Army's active component end strength on 30 September 2007 totaled  522,147  personnel:  70,839  commissioned  officers,  13,843 warrant  officers,  433,101  enlisted  soldiers,  and  4,364  academy cadets.  This  was  a  total  increase  of  14,989  since  October  2006. Minorities  constituted  37.5  percent  of  the  active Army. At  the  end of  September  2007,  women  constituted  13.7  percent  of  the  active Army, with 71,100 females serving on active duty. Of these, 11,824 were officers, 1,159 were warrant officers, and 58,117 were enlisted. Women who were  married  at  the  time  of  their  active  duty  service constituted 46.1 percent of those in the Army, and 14 percent were single with children.

The Army National  Guard's  (ARNG)  end  strength  in  September 2007  totaled  352,707:  30,757  commissioned  officers,  6,738  warrant officers,  and  315,212  enlisted  soldiers.  Minorities  constituted  25.4 percent  of  the  Army  National  Guard.  At  the  end  of  FY  2006  the National  Guard  had  346,288  soldiers,  out  of  authorized  strength  of 350,000. Women constituted 13.8 percent of the Army National Guard.

The end strength of the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) in September 2007  was  189,882:  33,265  commissioned  officers,  2,725  warrant officers,  and  153,892  enlisted  soldiers.  Minorities  constituted  40.2 percent of the Army Reserve, while women made up 23.4 percent of the total. In FY 2007 the Army Reserve's authorized strength dropped from 205,000 to 200,000.

At  Army  Headquarters,  General  Casey  received  the  nomination from President Bush to become the 36th Chief of Staff, U.S. Army, to succeed General Peter J. Schoomaker, who had served in that position since August 2003. Casey received Senate confirmation on 8 February 2007,  by  a  vote  of  83-14.  He  assumed  his  new  duties  on  10  April 2007, in a ceremony at Fort Myer, Virginia. Three months later, on 13 July,  Preston  Geren  received  unanimous  confirmation  by  the  Senate to become the secretary of the Army. Geren had been acting secretary of the Army since 9 March, after he replaced Secretary Harvey, who resigned on 2 March.

## Manning Initiatives

The demands of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq led to pressures on the Army's uniformed and civilian leaders with regard to the use of its forces. President Bush announced in early 2007 his intention to 'grow' the Army  by  approximately  65,000  soldiers  between  FY  2008  and  FY 2013, and in January Secretary Gates authorized the Army to increase the active force by 65,000 to a permanent end strength of 547,000 by 2012. To maintain its strength in active theaters, however, the Army announced in April, at the request of General Casey and Secretary Geren, that soldiers in all active duty Army units in Central Command would begin serving longer combat deployments-fifteen months rather than twelve months. They would spend no less than twelve months at home before another deployment. Even with these changes, Army Vice Chief of Staff General Richard A. Cody declared in July 2007 that the 65,000 personnel increase was inadequate to meet the service' s demands and that more troops were needed.

In March 2007, the G-1 issued manning guidance for the fiscal year for Headquarters, Department of the Army, active component forces. The guidelines signified a move toward a phased readiness strategy necessary to support Army Force Generation, the structured progression of increased unit readiness over time. The ARFORGEN process resulted in recurring periods of availability of trained, ready, and cohesive active, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve units prepared for operational deployment. All manning initiatives were designed to support the prosecution of the Global War on Terrorism and Army transformation.

## Enlisted Personnel

For FY 2007, the Army's accession goal was 80,000 new soldiers, in addition to 35,505 for the Army Reserve and 70,000 for the Army National Guard. After a struggle with recruiting in May and June, the results for the Army's active component improved late in the fiscal year and ended with 100.5 percent of its accession mission with the recruitment of 80,407 new service members ( Table 3 ). The Army added about 1,200 recruiters over the prior 18 months to achieve this goal, which raised the total personnel performing that duty to 8,400.

The Army's recruiting success, however, came with a price. Although the percentage of recruits who scored above average on the Armed Forces Qualification Test remained stable at 61 percent during FY 2007, only 79 percent of the new recruits entering the Army possessed a high school diploma. This level was below the Department of Defense benchmark standard of 90 percent, which the other services met. Additionally, the

Army  accessed  3,200  Category  IV  recruits,  those  who  scored  in  the lowest third on the aptitude test. The Army also approved more criminal history waivers-15 percent of new recruits-than it had in years past. Of those  approved  waivers,  87  percent  were  because  of  misdemeanor convictions.  The  remainder  of  them  were  for  more  serious  offenses including felonies. FY 2007 saw an increase in the number of medical and  misconduct  waivers  granted  as  well.  Nearly  one  in  five  recruits required a waiver.

A  number  of  causes  contributed  to  the  recruiting  difficulties experienced  during  the  year.  Relatively  low  unemployment  in  the United States,  the  rate  of  which  declined  from  6  percent  in  2003  to 4.6 percent for 2006 and 2007, likely decreased economic incentives to join the services, as did the major role the Army played in the Iraq conflict.  Survey  research  conducted  prior  to  FY  2007  indicated  that certain  segments  of  the  adult  population-especially  women  and African Americans-had  become  less  likely  to  recommend  military service to young people since the invasion of Iraq commenced. Other evidence indicated that Army recruiters had difficulty signing up high school seniors, especially those below the age of eighteen, who required parental consent to enlist. Moreover, the ongoing effort to increase the size of the active Army increased the goal for new recruits from 73,800 in  2003  to  80,000  by  2008,  which  presented Army  recruiters  with  a more challenging goal.

The Army met the challenges to enlist more men and women with creative solutions. A new nationwide Army recruiting campaign started on  9  November,  with  advertisements  delivered  through  television, internet  search  engines,  text  messaging,  and  Web  sites,  including  an updated  www.goarmy.com Web  site. The  new  theme,  'Army  Strong,' was intended to be distinctive and powerful and replaced the 'Army of One' slogan in use since early 2001. McCann Worldgroup, a marketing

The logo introduced in November 2007 as part of the 'Army Strong' campaign



communications  agency  retained  by  the  Army  in  December  2005, developed  the  campaign  by  conducting  research  among  prospective recruits and their influencers, and interacted with hundreds of active duty soldiers. Print advertisements began running in January 2007, primarily with media that appealed to young adults. The campaign had a budget estimated at $1.35 billion over five years. The advertisement efforts also funded national sponsorships to help promote awareness and interaction with the Army, such as NASCAR and the National Hot Rod Association drivers, and athletes who competed as professional bull riders, cowboys, and arena football players. Bowing to the social realities of the time, the television ads for the most part omitted images related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

To help meet the challenge of maintaining a large volunteer force during  wartime,  the Army  also  used  several  enlistment  incentives  for its recruiters, as well as soldiers already in the ranks and for those who referred potential enlistees. In November 2006, the Army doubled the existing bonus amount for active duty and reserve-component soldiers and military retirees who referred qualified recruits to the Referral Bonus Pilot  Program  to  $2,000.  By  February  2007,  the  Army  had  received more than ten thousand referrals. The Army expanded its Referral Bonus Program to include civilian employees in March 2007, making it possible for them to earn $2,000 as well. By early August, sponsors had referred

31,000 recruits resulting in 6,800 contracts.

In  late  May,  the  U.S. Army Recruiting Command introduced two  new  enlistment  incentives. A  bonus  of  up  to  $51,864  was available to recruits who signed up  for  a  two-year  enlistment  in more than forty-five active-Army military occupational specialties, including fire support specialist, signal  support  systems  specialist,  petroleum  supply  specialist, pharmacy  specialist,  and  health care  specialist.  The  Army  also raised  the  maximum  combined bonus  for  a  three-year  enlistment  from  $10,000  to  $25,000 for  certain  military  occupation specialties. Qualified recruits who  enlisted  for  two  years  in addition to training were eligible for an enlistment bonus of up to $15,000, as well as Montgomery GI Bill and Army College Fund benefits.



To bolster the growth of the Army  by  more  than  thirty-four thousand soldiers, Army officials in  August  began  implementing bonuses for recruits who signed up by the end of September 2007.

In 2007 'America's Army' was released in several new platforms including arcade and mobile devices.

The Army Recruiting Command announced $20,000 'quick-ship' bonuses for aspiring recruits with no prior military service who enlisted for at least two years of active duty and reported to basic training within thirty days of their enlistment. Other initiatives included adding financial incentives and advertising a two-year enlistment option; establishing a program to help refine  nearly  one  million  leads  to  identify  prospective  recruits  with  the highest potential to enlist, to save recruiters time and allow them to focus on  prospecting;  requesting  additional  soldiers  graduating  from  initial training to serve as hometown recruiter assistants and returning combat veterans to serve as special recruiter assistants; re-emphasizing the $2,000 referral  bonus  program;  requesting  the  temporary  return  of  up  to  one

Originally released in 2002, 'America's Army' was created for recruitment purposes.



thousand former successful recruiters to augment the current recruiting force; and requesting general officer assistance to help the recruiting effort through speaking engagements in local communities and colleges and at events. Increasing the maximum enlistment age to forty-two years brought in hundreds more recruits that year as well.

Taking advantage of modern technology for recruiting purposes, the Army launched the game 'America's Army: Special Operations' for mobile phones in February 2007. An arcade version of 'America's Army' was released five months later. 'America's Army' consisted of a series of video games and other media developed by the Army and released for personal computers in 2002 as a global public relations initiative to help with recruitment. By 2007, it ranked in the top ten most popular computer games of its kind. In February 2007 the Army also  launched  'The  Virtual  Army  Experience,'  a  mobile  simulator that allows participants to experience various aspects of the soldier's life. 'The Virtual Army Experience' became available in a full-scale rendition  or  broken  down  into  two  smaller  versions  enabling  it  to appear at two separate events simultaneously at hundreds of venues across America. This  effort  did  meet  with  some  public  opposition, however,  among  critics  who  argued  that  war  was  an  inappropriate theme for a game.

In  addition  to  attracting  new  recruits  to  its  ranks,  the  Army  also sought  to  retain  its  veterans.  Retention  rates  among  units  supporting Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom exceeded the Army's goals, in part due to the use of deployed reenlistment bonuses to active duty soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait ( Table 4 ).  These incentives included tax free lump sums of up to $15,000, with an average payment of $10,400, provided soldiers reenlisted for three- to six-year extensions while still in the war zone. The Army increased bonuses by as much as $7,500 for soldiers whose terms of service expired in FY 2007, if they reenlisted by 30 April.

## Officer Personnel

The Army's need for junior officers in FY 2007 was acute. In February 2007 the Government Accountability Office reported that the Army had a  shortfall  of  mid-level  officers  because  it  commissioned  insufficient officers ten years beforehand during the post-Cold War force reductions. The report observed that the Army' s projected annual shortage of officers through FY 2013 was more than three thousand. To address this shortage of experienced leaders in its officer corps, the Army implemented a set of options in September 2007 to provide most captains a choice of incentives in  exchange  for  an  additional  three  years  of  active  duty  service. These included choice of post or branch, attending a military school, language training, attending a fully funded graduate school degree program, or a critical skills financial retention bonus. These incentives targeted 17,000 active duty Army captains.

## Civilian Personnel

The  Army  employed  221,666  direct-hire  employees  in  October 2006, a number that increased to 223,643 by September 2007. Over 4,600 Army civilians served in the field. In 2007, the Army converted 7,843  positions  from  military  to  civilian  status  to  'further  integrate the  civilian  corps  into  the Army  team.'  In  a  memorandum  issued  in September  2007,  Secretary  Geren  designated  himself  as  the  'Army Civilian Corps Champion,' committing himself and the Army chief of staff  to  'maximizing  the  development  of  the  Civilian  workforce  and transforming the systems and structures that provide its support.' The secretary  appointed  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the Army  as  the proponent of the Army's vision of the civilian corps as an important component  of  its  workforce,  as  well  as  the  integrator  between  staff elements.

On 19 April 2007, the Partnership for Public Service and American University's  Institute  for  the  Study  of  Public  Policy  Implementation recognized  the  Department  of  the Army  as  one  of  the  'Best  Places to  Work'  in  the  federal  government  for  2007.  The  Army  received the award for ranking tenth among large federal agencies, defined as those independent agencies or cabinet departments with two thousand or  more full-time, permanent employees. The 'Best Places to Work' survey aimed to present a comprehensive and authoritative rating of employee satisfaction across agencies and subcomponents in the federal government. The rankings provided job seekers insight on opportunities for  public  service  by  highlighting  the  federal  government's  highperforming agencies and promoting federal organizations.

Army civilians continued to transition to the new National Security Personnel System, an evaluation structure based on rewards for performance,  innovation,  and  results.  Implementation  occurred  in  mid2006 to  replace  the  General  Schedule system  with  a  pay  band  scheme intended to provide more flexibility in establishing compensation levels.In 2007, members of the Army Staff, Army Materiel Command, U.S. Army Medical Command, and the Military District of Washington converted to the National Security Personnel System.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Modularity

The Army continued to transform the operational force to multipurpose modular brigade-type units in the active and reserve components. Building on recommendations made by the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review, which called for forty-two brigade combat teams in the Regular Army and twentyeight in the Army National Guard, the Army began to plan for the creation of a rotational pool of brigade combat teams. Modularity, initially conceived in 2004, was designed to meet demands of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to  accelerate Army  modernization,  and  to  support  the  new  armed  forces global basing plans. The modular conversion of active and reserve forces was  designed  to  create  brigade-based  modules  that  Army  planners  and strategists could 'plug into' joint and coalition task forces in expeditionary and campaign settings.

Each brigade combat team, the basic building block of the Army' s fighting capability, fit into one of three standard designs: infantry, heavy infantry, and Stryker.  The Army planned approximately 225 support brigades to back up brigade combat teams, other services, and civil authorities in homeland defense missions, including disaster relief. The modular support brigades (including seventy-eight in the  Army National Guard and fifty-eight in the  Army Reserve) fell  into  two  categories,  multifunctional  support  brigades  and  functional support brigades. Multifunctional brigades were created to perform operational roles including combat aviation, combat support (maneuver enhancement), sustainment, fires, and battlefield surveillance. Functional brigades assumed broad support roles on a theaterwide basis including air defense, engineer, chemical, military police, signal, medical, logistics, and intelligence. Support brigades were trained, manned, and equipped to work directly for headquarters without  augmentation  of  either  personnel  or  equipment.  Finally,  the Army focused on creating 'whole' units that were fully manned, trained, equipped, and supported. Conscious of limited resources, Army planners chose to build fewer, but fully resourced, units.

The Army announced on 20 December 2006 that it would accelerate the modular conversion of two active-component brigade combat teams

to increase the number of combat and combat-support units available for overseas combat and homeland-defense missions, and to give units and soldiers more dwell time. The 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, at Fort Riley, Kansas, passed its transition team mission and resources to the 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, and converted to a heavy brigade combat team in April, eleven months earlier than planned. The brigade combat team re-flagged as the 2d Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, aligning all Fort Riley units under the 1st Infantry Division. The 3d Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, at  Fort  Hood, Texas,  converted  to  an  infantry  brigade  combat team in April, seventeen months earlier than planned. The unit relocated to Fort Knox, Kentucky.

The Army Science Board reported in January 2007 that the conversion to  a  modular  force  had  suffered  from  a  lack  of  focus  on  readiness  and other  measurements,  as  well  as  inadequate  attention  paid  to  software, network  issues,  and  the  potential  for  unmanned  systems  to  increase security  and  reduce  manpower requirements. The report concluded that the Army needed to examine the impact of these shortfalls on the quality of a modular force.

## Rebalancing and Stabilization

Preparing  units  for  deployment  during  wartime  was  a  top  priority for Army leaders. By late 2006, the secretary of the Army approved the new  Army  Force  Generation  program,  which  allowed  for  the  recurring availability  of  well-trained,  ready,  and  cohesive  active  component, Army National  Guard,  and  Army  Reserve  units  for  operational  deployment. Units  increased  their  readiness  as  they  progressed  through  three  force pools, dubbed 'Reset,' 'Train-Ready,' and 'Available.' During reset units reintegrated soldiers and their families, and completed individual education, development, and training, while the institutional Army focused on manning and equipping the unit for future collective training. The focus of the trainready pool was unit training, with the unit leaving this stage upon completion of a culminating collective training event, after which the unit entered the available force pool. From this stage units were subject to deployment. With this model, Headquarters, Department of the Army, exercised oversight of the ARFORGEN process managed by U.S. Army Forces Command.

## Army Aviation

In early July 2007, the Defense Department announced its approval of full-rate production of UH-60M and HH-60M Black Hawk helicopters by Sikorsky Aircraft under a $23.8 billion U.S. Army program. Kenneth J.  Krieg,  Undersecretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and
Logistics, also approved procurement of advanced materials in FY 2008 for the program to upgrade the U.S. military' s popular Black Hawk helicopter. The Bush administration requested $1.2 billion for forty-two Black Hawk helicopters in FY 2007.

The Boeing Company announced on 16 July 2007 that the U.S. Army had  authorized  full-rate  production  and  fielding  of  the  new  CH-47F Chinook helicopter. The CH-47F had completed U.S. Army operational testing  at  Fort  Campbell,  Kentucky,  in April  2007. The  cost  of  a  new CH-47F was $32 million, but the costs were reduced to $8.5 million per aircraft by remanufacturing CH-47Ds to CH-47Fs with the CH-47F improved cargo helicopter Service Life Extension Program. Following extensive  testing,  the Army  authorized  First  Unit  Equipped,  assigning the aircraft to a company of the 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, based at Fort Campbell.

In October 2006,  American Eurocopter received a production contract for  345  UH-72  Lakota  aircraft  to  replace  aging  UH-1H/V  and  OH58A/C helicopters in Army and Army National Guard inventories. The Army took delivery of the first aircraft on 11 December 2006, while the first production helicopters went to the National Training Center (NTC) at  Fort  Irwin,  California,  for  medical  evacuation  missions  in  January 2007. On 20 June 2007, the NTC's United States Army Air Ambulance Detachment became the first operational unit to field the Lakota.



## Training

In  the  beginning  of  FY  2007,  the  Army  published  two  new  field manuals (FM) with direct bearing on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Urban Operations , FM 3-06, published in October 2006, discussed major Army  operations  in  urban  environments  and  how  complex  terrain,  a concentrated population, and an infrastructure of systems affect how Army forces operate. The new manual served to demonstrate how soldiers were to apply the doctrinal principles in FM 3-0 to this unique environment.

In December 2006, the Army published FM 3-24, Counterinsurgency . Based on two years of study, and prepared in cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps, this publication was a significant revision of the Army' s existing  counterinsurgency  doctrine.  Written  to  provide  principals  and guidelines for counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was grounded in historical studies and informed by modern experience. This joint effort between the Army and the Marine Corps established doctrine to  help  American  military  leaders  face  the  challenges  of  asymmetric warfare. The manual's authors used input from over one thousand soldiers and  marines  to  prepare  the  guide,  as  well  as  feedback  from  U.S.  State Department employees, Central Intelligence Agency officials, academic experts, and representatives of the international human rights community. Instructors  at  the  Command  and  General  Staff  College  and  the  Army War College began teaching from the new manual upon its publication. In addition to providing guidance for current operations, the new manual discussed historical approaches to counterinsurgency taken by U.S. forces, and highlighted the importance of continually evaluating the circumstances of a counterinsurgency campaign so forces can adapt their actions.

A new information technology system was introduced to Army civilians  in 2007,  the  Army  Civilian  Education  System  (CES). The  Army  Management  Staff  College  offered  this  comprehensive, sequential  leader  development  and  education  program  to  prepare career  Army  civilians  for  leadership  roles.  Developed  by  the  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, CES provided civilians with essential  skills  to  support  the  war  fighter  as  leaders  in  the  Army community.  Available  to  all  Army  employees,  the  courses  were competency-based, sequential, and progressive, using a combination of  distributed  learning  followed  by  residential  training  available  at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

## Deployed Operational Forces

In the fall of 2006, America' s military leadership changed while U.S.led  efforts  to  defeat  the  insurgency  in  Iraq  continued.  On  8  November ,

Secretary  of  Defense  Donald  H. Rumsfeld  resigned,  one  day  after Congressional midterm elections turned  control  of  Congress  over to  the  Democrats.  President  Bush announced that Rumsfeld would be replaced  by  Robert  Gates,  former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  By  the  end  of  2006,  the war in Iraq had failed to quell the insurgents, despite over three years of Army  military  operations  since the fall of Baghdad. Sectarian violence between Iraqi Shi'ites and Sunnis escalated as public support  among Americans  for  the war declined. Five combat brigades drawn from the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 82d Divisions deployed to Iraq between February and June 2007.

Early  in  January  2007,  President  Bush  named  General  David  H. Petraeus to be the top U.S. military commander in Iraq. Shortly thereafter, on 10 January 2007, the president announced his decision to deploy an additional thirty thousand troops to Iraq in what became known as 'the Surge,' an increased effort to quell sectarian violence in that country by sending more soldiers. In April, the Defense Department announced that twelve thousand National Guard troops would go to Iraq and Afghanistan in addition to those previously designated as part of the Surge. General Petraeus officially took charge of U.S. forces in Iraq on 10 February 2007, replacing General Casey, who became Army chief of staff.

In late December 2006, the Diyala campaign began, consisting of a series of operations conducted by coalition forces against Iraqi insurgents and a number of bombing and guerrilla attacks against the security forces in the Diyala Governorate. Most of the heavy fighting had ended and the U.S. and Iraqi forces managed to clear all remaining insurgent fighters out of the Diyala River Valley by the beginning of October 2007. U.S. forces in  Iraq  continued to battle insurgents and suffered significant casualties as well. In March 2007, U.S. and Iraqi forces began fighting at Ba'qubah, in the capital of the Iraqi province of Diyala, in order to establish security and stability in the region, a process which lasted several months. In June of that year U.S. forces began arming Sunni militias (primarily in Anbar Province) in order to enable them to fight militants linked with al-Qaeda, with  whom  they  had  previously  been  allied.

month, Operation P hantom T hunder began when Multi-National ForceIraq launched large-scale offensive operations against al-Qaeda and other Iraqi terrorists. Operation P hantom T hunder was a corps-level operation in Diyala Province, Anbar Province, Babil Province, Baghdad, and in areas of southern Iraq. It was one of the largest military operations in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003, and aimed to eliminate al-Qaeda in Iraq and Iranian-supported terror groups. The operation concluded in January 2008.

By mid-August 2007, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq reached the highest of the war (approximately 162,000 soldiers). The following month, reports indicated that U.S. forces had made some progress in the efforts to protect the Iraqi people from insurgent violence. Data on car bombs, suicide  attacks,  civilian  casualties,  and  other  security  measures  in  Iraq showed that violence was declining, though the levels generally remained higher than in 2004 and 2005. Nevertheless, the Pentagon delayed security handover to Iraqi authorities for the second time that year due to difficulties in  developing  Iraqi  police  forces  and  the  slow  pace  of  economic  and political progress there.

The fighting for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-led forces in  Afghanistan  remained  intense  throughout  the  second  half  of  2006.

NATO assumed responsibility for security across the whole of Afghanistan in  October 2006, taking command in the east from a U.S.-led coalition force.  NATO troops were successful in achieving tactical victories over the Taliban and denied areas to them, but the Taliban were not completely defeated, and NATO had to continue operations into 2007.

Operation M ountain F ury was a NATO-led operation started on 16 September 2006 to clear Taliban rebels from the eastern provinces of Afghanistan and to enable reconstruction projects such as schools, health care facilities, and courthouses to continue. The Taliban suffered heavy losses during the operation. U.S. troops initiated their combat operations against the Taliban forces that were entrenched in the mountains on the border with Pakistan in the provinces of Paktika, Khost, Ghazni, Paktia, Logar, and Nuristan. The U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division led efforts to establish remote outposts in regions previously dominated by Taliban elements. These outposts came under sustained attack, as did U.S. Army

82d Airborne Division in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, as part of Operation Achilles



combat patrols, which resulted in almost one hundred fifty casualties by the beginning of December. ( See Table 6. ) On 15 January 2007, NATO leaders formally declared an end to the operation.

In  March  2007,  one  thousand  U.S.  troops  took  part  in  Operation A chilles , an  offensive  designed  to  clear  the  Helmand  Province  in Afghanistan of Taliban fighters. The offensive was the largest NATO-led operation held in Afghanistan to date, and involved more than forty-five hundred NATO troops and close to one thousand Afghan personnel. The operation ended in late May.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Change

Organizationally,  the Army  continued  to  shift  the  chief  role  of  the reserve components from a strategic reserve to an operational force with units specifically organized to engage in combat, provide combat support, or provide service support. By the end of FY 2007, Guard units prepared for  transformation  to  modular  units  like  the  active  army,  in  order  to become fully  manned,  trained,  and  equipped  operational  brigades. This restructuring  created  twenty-eight  brigade  combat  teams  (seven  heavy, twenty infantry, and one Stryker), seven fires brigades, nine sustainment brigades,  six  battlefield  surveillance  brigades,  eight  combat  aviation brigades, four theater aviation brigades, one theater aviation group, thirtyeight functional brigades, two special forces groups, and sixteen maneuver enhancement  brigades,  which  included  headquarters,  tactical  combat forces, and engineer and military police battalions. At the end of FY 2007, the  Army  National  Guard  had  transformed  more  than  fifteen  hundred operating force units to their new designs, and planned to convert more than thirteen hundred additional units to the new modular designs by the end of FY 2008.

Measures to strengthen the Army National Guard in 2008 and beyond came under the consideration of the U.S. Senate at the end of the fiscal year.  In  September  2007,  Senate  National  Guard  caucus  cochairmen Patrick J. Leahy  (D-Vt.)  and  Christopher  S. 'Kit' Bond  (R-Mo.) introduced  legislation  to  give  the  National  Guard  input  into  Pentagon programming, budgeting, and strategy formulation; make the deputy of Northern Command a National Guard officer; and elevate the National Guard Bureau chief to the rank of four-star general.

## Personnel Management

At the end of FY 2007, there were a total of 352,707 National Guard troops, of which 33,193 were serving in Operation I raqi F reedom , 4,808 in  Operation  E nduring F reedom ,  and  164  in  Operation  N oble E agle (homeland  security  and  support  to  federal,  state,  and  local  agencies). Additionally, as of 30 September, 2,597 personnel were serving in support

of the U.S. southwest border mission to prevent illegal immigration and interdict drug smuggling. The Army National Guard formed the nucleus of Task Force P hoenix , the Operation E nduring F reedom mission to train the Afghan National Army to be a self-sustaining Army.

## Recruiting and Retention

Army National Guard recruiting in FY 2007 proved to be a success because of several innovative programs, incentives, and command emphasis. The incentives included increasing bonus maximums to $20,000 for enlistments, $15,000 for reenlistments, and $15,000 for prior-service enlistments. The Army National Guard also increased retention bonuses from $5,000 to $15,000 and implemented several initiatives to help achieve and maintain congressionally  authorized  end-strength  levels:  the  Guard Recruiting Assistance Program, the Recruit Sustainment Program, Every Soldier a Recruiter, and the 'American Soldier' advertising campaign. The Guard Recruiting Assistance Program was a contract program designed for individuals who voluntarily applied to become recruiting assistants and provided services by contacting people in their communities to discuss joining  the  Guard.  At  the  end  of  FY  2007,  there  were  approximately 113,000  active  recruiting  assistants.  The  Recruit  Sustainment  Program reduced  training  pipeline  losses  by  introducing  newly  enlisted  ARNG soldiers  to  the  military  and  easing  their  adjustment  to  Basic  Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), while the Every Soldier a Recruiter campaign paid bonuses to individual national guardsmen for signing up new recruits with no prior military service who completed AIT. The bonus was paid in two lump sum installments: $1,000 after the soldier attended initial entry training and $1,000 after the soldier graduated from AIT. The 'American Soldier' advertising campaign refocused the image of the ARNG from a strategic reserve to an operational force by creating new messages, imagery, mediums, and response devices. This recruiting effort focused spending on innovative advertising programs such as NASCAR, iTunes, event teams, pizza boxes, gaming, and theater and also relied on Web-based advertising and the 1-800-GO-GUARD Web site. The Army National Guard had the nation's largest recruiting force with more than 6,500 recruiters.

The Army Reserve, despite having missed its quantity goal for the three preceding fiscal years, rebounded in FY 2007 and achieved 100.6 percent of its annual requirement. The comparatively high rates of mobilization in the Army Reserve components during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may have been a factor in making recruiting difficult. Moreover, among soldiers leaving active duty, concerns about being promptly called back to active service by mobilization orders and deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan,

or some other location may have discouraged reserve affiliation as well. In order to boost Army Reserve officer numbers, the Army offered bonuses of $10,000 to those active component officers, typically captains and majors, who accepted commissions in the USAR's Individual Ready Reserve or a Selected Reserve unit, one considered to be in an active status and most readily available for call-up to active duty.

## Training and Readiness

The most significant challenge facing the Army National Guard in FY 2007 was the chronic shortage of equipment in units not deployed. By April 2007, the National Guard had only 40 percent of required equipment within units not serving overseas and only 12 percent of the units at home were fully equipped. The average nondeployed unit had less than 54 percent of its authorized equipment needed to conduct training, to respond to domestic missions, and for future deployments. Some units had as little as 33 percent of  required  equipment.  These  units  were,  therefore,  'not  operationally ready' due to major equipment shortfalls. Much of the deficiency resulted from the Army's practice  of  pooling  equipment  from  across  the  force  to supply  deploying  units,  which  left  stateside  forces  bereft  of  their  assets. States across the country eventually entered into an agreement to share their National Guard resources to attempt to fill  in  gaps  as  needed,  called  the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. Nevertheless, unresourced shortfalls  still  existed  in  2007  that  approached  the  $40  billion  needed  to provide equipment and training for the Army National Guard.

In May, Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, testified  before  the  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on  Homeland Security' s Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Management. The Defense Department had proposed spending $22 billion for National Guard  equipment  purchases  over  the  next  five  years,  but,  as  General Blum observed, that would equip the Guard to only 75 percent, its level before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The ARNG chief was also critical of the equipment most Guard units had at home and declared that some of it was decades old and not fit for active service, to sell, or even to give away. In 2007, the Army's senior leadership recognized the Guard's equipment shortfalls and programmed over $12 billion for new equipment  in  FY  2008  through  FY  2013. This  unprecedented  increase aimed to improve the average nondeployed unit equipment-on-hand levels from the current 54 percent to 77 percent. The top three supply challenges facing the ARNG included the availability of equipment for deployment and premobilization training, the availability of equipment for the Guard' s mission for homeland defense and support to civil authorities, and Army transformation and modular force.

Several other changes occurred during FY 2007 to resolve reset issues within  the  National  Guard. The  reset  process  restored  the  readiness  of Army National Guard and prepared units for rapid reaction capabilities for unexpected worldwide contingencies. Reset did not, however, remedy all shortfalls of equipment still committed in support of Operations I raqi F reedom and  E nduring F reedom .  The  Army  National  Guard  received funding directly to reduce bureaucratic delays and conduct reset operations at home stations. The National Guard initially received $127 million for FY  2007,  followed  by  an  additional  $38  million  from  Headquarters, Department of the Army. A streamlining of the reset process resulted in states receiving their equipment much faster.

## Mobilization

The Army National Guard provided more than 5,700 soldiers from 45 states, totaling 115,000 man-days to support U.S. European Command in FY 2007. The National Guard played a pivotal role in the successful execution of the U.S. Southern Command's mission to provide regional stability to Latin  America and the Caribbean. During FY 2007, 5,016 Army

National Guardsmen from 27 states deployed to the region. The ARNG also provided forces to U.S. Central Command's two major exercises in FY 2007, R egional C ooperation and S teppe E agle , both in Kazakhstan, and to U.S. Pacific Command as well. Overseas mission support included multiple linguist and translator missions to Korea and Japan. Within the United  States, ARNG  units  responded  to  extensive  tornado  damage  in Kansas, the Interstate 35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Tropical Storm Erin in Texas.

Structurally,  the  Army  continued  to  change  the  reserves  from  a traditional  strategic  reserve  mobilized  only  in  national  emergencies,  to an operational reserve involved in Army requirements. In support of this change, the U.S. Army Reserve underwent restructuring to the Army Force Generation model. Army leaders planned to deploy reservists once every five years, and by 2007, there were 25,000-35,000 Army Reserve soldiers routinely mobilized at any given time for duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in  homeland  support.  During  2007,  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command  had approximately 72,000 guardsmen and reservists mobilized for active duty per month.

On 19 January 2007, Secretary Gates redefined the mobilization policy. In his 'Utilization of the Total Force' memorandum, Gates identified six key areas of mobilization policy to adjust in order to better manage the Army Reserve components during the Global War on Terrorism. These six  key  policy  modifications  included  setting  the  length  of  involuntary mobilization at a maximum of twelve months; mobilizing ground forces on a unit basis instead of by individual soldiers; establishing a planning objective with a ratio of one year of mobilization followed by five years of dwell time; establishing a new program to compensate members required to mobilize or deploy early or often, or be extended beyond established rotation  policy  goals;  reviewing  hardship  waiver  programs  to  ensure they  were  properly  taking  into  account  exceptional  circumstances;  and, minimizing the use of stop loss as a force management tool.

## Materiel and Aviation

By the close of FY 2007, three Army National Guard aviation brigade level units had been deployed-the 42d Aviation Brigade from Fort Dix, New Jersey; the 185th Aviation Group from Jackson, Mississippi; and the 36th Aviation  Brigade  from  Fort  Hood.  Continuing  shortages  in  filling the modernized aircraft authorized for ARNG aviation units remained a problem for the Guard throughout FY 2007.



## Management and Planning

As  part  of  the  Army  Materiel  Command's  reorganization  of  its logistical infrastructure to support the modular field Army  more effectively,  the  new  U.S.  Army  Sustainment  Command  at  Rock  Island Arsenal, Illinois, began operations in FY 2007. This newest AMC major subordinate  command  resulted  from  the  transformation  of  the  U.S. Army Field  Support  Command.  In  addition  to  continuing  the  missions of  the  former  Field  Support  Command,  including Army  Pre-positioned Stocks management, administration of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program,  and  operating  the  Logistics  Assistance  Program,  the  Army Sustainment Command gained critical missions in support of the Army Force Generation process. The new assignment included assisting Army depots with reset tasks, distribution and materiel management services, contingency contracting, and management of training equipment. Seven deployable Army field support brigades comprised the Army Sustainment Command to provide a single command structure in strategic locations, including Kuwait, Europe, and Forts Bragg, Lewis, and Hood. The Army Sustainment  Command  thus  became  the  linchpin  linking  the  national sustainment base with the expeditionary Army.

Continuing  efforts to improve  efficiency, the Army  announced in  August  that  almost  10  percent  of  its  programs  had  implemented  a performance-based logistical supporting strategy, while another 30 percent had  pending  performance-based  logistics  strategies.  The  performancebased logistics approach was intended to achieve improved performance at a reduced life cycle cost. As of 30 June, 32 programs had implemented performance-based logistics and the move was pending for 102 additional programs. The Pentagon instituted performance-based logistics to improve operational readiness and logistical response times while decreasing costs and the program's environmental footprint.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

While  supporting  the  conflicts  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  research, development,  and  acquisition  programs  aimed  to  prepare  the Army  for

future threats by modernizing and transforming technologies and materiel. In May, the Army released an overarching plan for developing technologies to meet the force transformation goals set by the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review. The Army Science and Technology Master Plan was developed in coordination with other military services, defense agencies, and industry partners, as well as with  consideration  of  international  technology capabilities. The largest near-term science and technology investment for the Army focused on maturing technologies to enable fielding of the initial Future  Combat System brigade combat team and follow-on technology 'spin outs.'

The Army remained committed to its key modernization program, the Future Combat Systems, in FY 2007. This initiative represented the first full modernization of the ground forces in more than four decades. The Future  Combat Systems consisted of eighteen components, including a networked  battle  command  system,  non-line-of-sight  precision  missiles and  gun  launched  munitions,  engine  technology,  and  unmanned  air and  ground  systems.  Despite  looming  budgetary  constraints,  the Army opened the Future Combat Systems Test Operations Complex at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, on 23 October 2006, and stood up an  evaluation  task  force  there,  and  at  Fort  Bliss, Texas,  in  an  effort  to move FCS from the development stage to testing, refining, and evaluation. The first deployment, or spin out, of FCS technology was scheduled for delivery to the Army Evaluation Task Force in 2008, which consisted of unattended ground sensors, non-line-of-sight launch system, and a joint tactical radio system.

In 2007, the Army budgeted $300 million for planned Future Combat Systems  program  technologies.  Budget  reductions  over  the  prior  three years and anticipated fiscal limitations for future years reduced the scope and delayed the FCS fielding schedule by FY 2007, and also postponed the Army's plans to field the first of fifteen projected FCS-equipped brigade combat teams. In February 2007, the Army announced restructuring of the modernization effort, in order to adapt to previous congressional cuts and tightened budgets. Under the revised plan, the service aimed to cut four Future Combat Systems platforms, reduce the number of times brigades received  FCS  technologies,  and  slow  the  pace  at  which  FCS-equipped brigades were fielded.

The high projected costs of Future Combat Systems led to continued scrutiny from congressional representatives, so-called 'watchdog' groups,  and  Defense  Department  budget  analysts.  Moreover,  several studies conducted by researchers outside the U.S. Army projected higher costs  for  FCS  than  did  Army  officials.  In  July,  House  appropriators voted to cut $406 million from the Future Combat Systems program in research, development, test, and evaluation funding. The proposed cuts

would reduce FCS research and development allocations by $47 million, while  also  cutting  funds  for  FCS  manned,  common,  and  unmanned ground vehicles.

Apart  from  Future  Combat  Systems,  the  Army  also  worked  to develop  new  information  technologies,  including  the  Joint  Network Node (JNN), a communication system designed to be the new tactical command  and  control  backbone  using a remote, satellite-based communications  system  to  provide  beyond-line-of-sight  capabilities. The Joint Network Node provided a package of voice, video, and data communication tools designed to meet the needs of commanders at the division,  brigade,  and  battalion  command  post  level. The  JNN,  after field  testing  by  soldiers  at  the  National Training  Center,  Fort  Irwin, California, began to see use in Iraq in 2007. Due to competing Army priorities,  however,  it  was  subject  to  significant  budget  scrutiny  and cost cutting by May 2007, at which time House and Senate authorizers recommended the Army combine its two current and future high-speed information network programs and cut funding for procurement of the Joint Network Node.

Major  systems  the  Army  focused  on  in  the  FY  2007  budget  for research, development, and acquisition and procurement included AH-64D Longbow Apache attack helicopters, RCH-47 Chinook cargo helicopters, UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters, armed reconnaissance helicopters, and light utility helicopters. Additionally, the Army expected FY  2007  funding  for  the  High-Mobility  Artillery  Rocket  System,  the

Javelin antitank weapon, a tank upgrade program, Future Combat Systems, the interim armored vehicle, and several tactical vehicles.

With  an  eye  toward  technology  and  innovation,  the  commanding general of the U.S. Army Materiel Command, the U.S. Army vice chief of staff, and other senior Army science and technology leaders recognized the U.S. Army's 'Top Ten Greatest Inventions of 2007' in an awards ceremony on  12  June  in  Arlington,  Virgina.  The  Army-wide  awards  program recognized outstanding technology solutions, and nine of the ten award recipients  were  elements  of  the  U.S. Army  Research  Development  and Engineering Command. The Army chose the ten winning programs based on their impact on Army capabilities, inventiveness, and potential benefit outside the Army. The inventions included the Unmanned Aircraft System Shadow 200 Communications Relay System; Objective Gunner Protection Kit; the Excalibur Precision Guided Extended Range Artillery Projectile, the M110 7.62-mm. Semi-Automatic Sniper System; the Picatinny Blast Shield  for  light  armored  vehicle;  and  the  Improvised  Explosive  Device Interrogation Arm.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The Army Family Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (FMWR) program was  a  $1.9  billion  annual  business  with  more  than  thirty-six  thousand employees  serving  more  than  five  million  authorized  patrons.  Garrison commanders managed these activities, funded by authorized and available appropriated  funds  and  by  nonappropriated  funds  generated  locally  by FMWR activities.

In  FY  2007,  Army  Family  and  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation Command received $972 million in appropriated funds from Congress and $1.3 billion in nonappropriated funds, primarily from cash register sales of  goods  and  services.  FMWR' s  major  business  partner,  the Army  and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), provided a $137 million dividend to Army FMWR based on two distinct agreements. The Army shares 50 percent of AAFES net income after depreciation with the Air Force based on the number of active duty soldiers and airmen in each service-the Army receives 30 percent and the Air Force 20 percent of the allocation. Through the Army Simplified Dividend, garrisons also receive 100 percent of Class VI profits, 80 percent of pay telephone revenue, and .4 percent of all local AAFES sales. The latter component is deducted from the Army share of total AAFES profit with the remainder going to the Army FMWR fund.

## Housing and Infrastructure

A strong commitment to improve the quality of life for soldiers and their families led the Army to commit much of its resources to building projects, including an investment of $37 billion over five years for military construction to support base realignment and closure. In FY 2007, money went to providing new or renovated Army barracks and family housing. The Army began allowing the Corps of Engineers to implement contracts on an accelerated schedule to speed the execution of numerous building projects. The Army utilized the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) to build  modern  residential  communities  for  military  families.  The program provided long-term, quality, sustainable housing where soldiers

trained, mobilized, and deployed. Using RCI, by summer 2007, the Army was closer to fulfilling its vision of eliminating inadequate family housing, having constructed more than ten thousand new homes and completing renovations  on  an  additional  ten  thousand.  As  of  1  September  2007, the Army had privatized family housing at 36 of its installations with a goal of 78,789 homes. Key RCI accomplishments in FY 2007 included completion of additional housing at Forts Bragg, Drum, and Bliss and a plan to privatize an additional three new projects and expand three existing projects with approximately 2,939 homes.

## Safety

The Army lost 250 soldiers to accidents in FY 2007, 10 more than in the previous fiscal year. The greatest killer continued to be accidents involving personally-owned vehicles, which accounted for 116, or 46.4 percent, of the deaths. Other accidental deaths included 47 from personal injury, 33 Army motorized vehicles, 11 from Army combat vehicle accidents, and 37 from aviation mishaps. Sixty-eight ground fatalities occurred on duty and 145 off duty. The Army had 2,271 ground mishaps during the fiscal year; it also suffered 203 aviation accidents.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service supported Army troops at  home  and  abroad  by  providing  on-post  retail  locations  and  morale, welfare, and recreation funds to the service. In 2007, AAFES increased its earnings, subject to dividends, to $426 million, a 27 percent improvement, including appropriated funding. During the same period, AAFES decreased  its  inventory  by  $107.5  million.  Retail  sales  in  FY  2007  for AAFES facilities in all war zones were $737 million, up 13.8 percent from FY 2006. AAFES contributed $272.7 million in dividends, which support service members and their families. This represents the highest dividend returned to the services since FY 2000. These results were due to efforts to  improve  supply  chain  efficiencies  across  the  enterprise  and,  in  part, attributable to Congressional supplemental funding for reimbursement of AAFES expenses in support of the Global War on Terrorism.

In FY 2007, AAFES invested $355 million in capital programs at 57 installations, including 496 new or renovated retail, dining, and services facilities,  and  8  new  shopping  centers.  In  addition,  AAFES  formed  a real estate energy management team and joined the U.S. Green Building Council in 2007 to reduce energy consumption through employee training and construction of four shopping centers that were Leadership in Energy and Environment Design certified.

AAFES executives  also  developed  a  new  Planning, Allocation  and Replenishment  Division  in  2007  to  study  and  implement  industry  best practices  and  to  develop  new  business  opportunities  in  merchandising, forecasting, and inventory control.

In August  2007,  U.S. Army  Brig.  Gen.  Keith  L. Thurgood  became commander  of AAFES,  succeeding  Maj.  Gen.  Bill  Essex,  who  retired after a 34-year Air Force career. General Thurgood served previously as Assistant  Division  Commander  (Operation),  95th  Division,  U.S.  Army Reserves, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  employed  33,000 civilians and 580 soldiers in over 90 countries, and had 137 environmental protection  projects  under  construction  at  the  beginning  of  FY  2007. Additionally, USACE  engaged  in  construction of hospitals, roads, communication facilities, water treatment plants, and schools. The corps was  also  involved  in  Gulf  Coast  restoration  efforts,  including  Federal Emergency  Management  Agency-assigned  debris  clearing  missions, and work on the area's levees. A large demand for military construction existed, driven mainly by base realignment and closure concerns and aging buildings, as well as for housing and training facilities. Overseas, in the Gulf Region Division, the Army Corps of Engineers worked on building Iraq' s  capacity  to  take  over  the  reconstruction  effort. Approximately  75 percent of Gulf Region Division contractors and laborers were Iraqis. The USACE had 14,000-20,000 Afghans at work on projects in 2007.

## Environmental Protection

In  January  2007,  the  Army  announced  the  winners  of  its  highest honor for environmental stewardship. Six installations, one team, and one individual received Secretary of the Army Environmental Awards, which honor the Army's top programs in endangered species protection, historic preservation, waste  reduction,  environmental  cleanup,  and  pollution prevention.  The  Radford  Army  Ammunition  Plant,  in  Virginia,  one  of the Army's main TNT production facilities, won the award for Pollution Prevention.  The  U.S.  Army  Garrison  Grafenwoehr,  Germany,  won  the award  for  Environmental  Quality,  Overseas  Installation,  in  part  for  its efforts  to  give  soldiers  more  room to train. Karstin Carmany-George, a cultural  resources  manager  at  the  Indiana  Army  National  Guard,  took the Cultural Resources Management, Team/Individual category for using technology  to  manage  and  preserve  cultural  resources  and  support  the building of a state-of-the-art urban training complex. Letterkenny Army Depot, Pennsylvania, won the Environmental Quality, Industrial Installation award by applying lean manufacturing methods as it delivered almost nine

hundred reinforced armor High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle door kits to soldiers in Iraq. The cultural resource staff at Fort Drum, New York, constructed mock Muslim cemeteries and archeological sites for use as aerial gunnery avoidance target training and won the Cultural Resources Management, Installation award. The environmental staff from Fort Riley helped  make  land  available  for  a  Tactical  Unmanned  Aerial  System operational  area,  earning  the  Environmental  Restoration,  Installation award. At Camp Edwards Training Site, a Massachusetts Army National Guard installation, a training program that benefited eleven natural plant and  animal  communities  contributed  to  winning  the  Natural  Resources Conservation, Large Installation award. Fort Lewis, Washington, won the Pollution Prevention, Nonindustrial Installation award by reusing lumber and other resources from building deconstruction to make improvements to training facilities.

On  16  September  2007,  the  Army  received  the  Environmental Protection  Agency' s  'Best  of  the  Best  Award'  for  its  acquisition  and procurement  policies  that  support  environmental  initiatives  as  well  as soldiers. The award recognized the Halon-Free Military Ground Vehicle Fire  Suppression  System,  a  crew  compartment  explosion  suppression system. The systems were being retrofit in Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicles and watercraft.

## Legal Affairs

The Office of the Judge Advocate General advised the Army leadership and developed policies to improve the provision of legal services to Army commanders, soldiers, and support activities worldwide.

In FY 2007, the Criminal Law Division served as the focal point within the  Army  for  implementing  an  expansion  of  court-martial  jurisdiction over civilians. The 2007 National Defense Authorization Act amended the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to provide for court-martial jurisdiction over civilians serving with or accompanying the force during times of declared war, as has historically been the case, as well as during contingency  operations.  The  Criminal  Law  Division  worked  with  the Defense  Department's  Office  of  General  Counsel  in  drafting  policies concerning appropriate authority to exercise this jurisdiction ( Table 7 ).

Nineteen  active  duty  military  judges,  one  mobilized  U.S.  Army Reserves military judge, and eighteen reserve military judges not on active duty presided over 1,468 general and special courts-martial worldwide in FY 2007, a slight increase from FY 2006. Trials in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait numbered 108 for FY 2007, bringing the total number of cases tried  in  combat  pay  zones  to  over  600  since  May  2003.  Army  judges

continued  to  preside  over  high-profile  cases,  including  the  only  officer tried  for  misconduct  related  to  the Abu  Ghraib  prisoner  abuse  scandal and a desertion case stemming from an Army officer's moral opposition to the war in Iraq. A military judge provided instruction to Iraqi judges in Baghdad as part of a program to stand up the Iraqi judiciary, and a military judge briefed contingents of African and Korean judges as part of outreach efforts by the Department of State.

The U.S.  Army  Trial  Defense  Service  (USATDS) has approximately 130 active duty and 180 reserve attorneys who provided professional defense services to soldiers throughout the Army from 63 active duty installations worldwide and 54 reserve locations. USATDS counsel defended soldiers facing  the  entire  range  of  allegations  under  the  UCMJ.  The  USATDS

detailed one or more counsel to every Army special and general courtsmartial referred in FY 2007 ( Tables 8 and 9 ). The Trial Defense Service counsel carry large workloads, assisting soldiers in myriad military justice related  actions.  USATDS  provided  defense  services  to  deployed  forces around the world, including in Iraq, Kuwait, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.

The  attorney  strength  of  the  active  component  Judge  Advocate General's  Corps  at  the  end  of  FY  2007  was  1,643  (including  general officers). This total did not include sixty-two officers who attended law school while participating in the Funded Legal Education Program. The attorney  strength  of  the  reserve  component  Judge  Advocate  General' s Corps at the end of FY 2007 was 1,921, and the strength of the Army National  Guard  at  the  end  of  FY  2007  was  575.  The  Army' s  diverse attorney  population  included  121 African Americans,  45  Hispanics,  75 Asians and Native Americans, and 414 women.

A November 2006 Associated Press investigation into the Army's handling of the death of Cpl. Patrick Tillman revealed new information about his controversial death while on active duty in 2004. Tillman, a former  National  Football  League  player  with  the Arizona  Cardinals, forsook his professional career and enlisted in the U.S. Army in the immediate  aftermath  of  the  11  September  2001  terrorist  attacks. Assigned  to  the  2d  Battalion,  75th  Ranger  Regiment,  he  was  killed on 22 April 2004, in a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan, although preliminary  statements  by  Army  authorities  indicated  that  Tillman was  killed  by  the  enemy.  The  investigative  documents  made  public by  Associated  Press reporters showed  that  four of the soldiers failed  to  identify  their  targets  before  shooting  during  the  firefight  in

which Tillman was killed, and one had recently undergone laser eye surgery. Moreover, key evidence in the incident was burned, including Tillman's body armor and uniform. In March 2006, the Army launched a  criminal  probe  of  the  incident,  and  acting  Army  Secretary  Geren publicly  apologized  to  Corporal Tillman's  family  for  mistakes  made in  reporting  his  death.  A  Department  of  Defense  Inspector  General report  and  findings  of  an Army  investigation  into  the  circumstances following  Tillman's  death  were  released  in  late  March  2007  and concluded that the cause of death was accidental fratricide. An initial report from Tillman's unit determined his death was due to hostile fire. When  follow-on  reports  indicated  Tillman's  death  was  an  accident, Army officials failed to notify the primary next of kin until a memorial service held weeks after his death. Tillman's chain of command made critical errors in the reporting and assigning investigative jurisdiction in the days following his death.

In  July  2007,  Secretary  Geren  censured  retired  Lt.  Gen.  Philip  R. Kensinger,  commanding  general  of  the  United  States  Army  Special Operations Command at the time of Tillman's death, for his 'failure of leadership  in  matters  relating  to  the  investigation  and  reporting  of  the death of Cpl. Pat Tillman.' Senior Army officers determined that General Kensinger lied to investigators about when he knew Tillman' s death was a suspected friendly fire case. Two brigadier generals also received written punishments for their roles in the case.

## Walter Reed Army Medical Center

On 2 March 2007 Secretary Harvey resigned as Secretary of the Army in the wake of revelations of poor care and squalid conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. In February 2007, stories in Washington newspapers reported that wounded soldiers were  burdened  by  administrative  bureaucracy,  placed  in  unclean quarters, and often neglected. Poorly maintained facilities, overworked case  managers,  cumbersome  regulations,  and  daunting  paperwork requirements for the soldiers were all issues raised by news reports. Many blamed cost-cutting measures, reduction of personnel, and the shift  from  federal  management  of  the  facilities  to  a  private  contract with  IAP  Worldwide.  Maj.  Gen.  Eric  B.  Schoomaker  replaced  Maj. Gen.  George W. Weightman  as  commanding  general  of  the  hospital and as commanding general of the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command, after the latter was relieved of duty by Secretary Harvey on 1 March. The Walter Reed Health Care system included 10 major treatment facilities in 3 states, with a staff of 6,000, of which more than 600 were Army physicians. It provided care for more than one hundred

fifty  thousand soldiers, other service members, family members, and retirees in the National Capital Area.

## 9 Conclusion

Fiscal year 2007 saw the Army continuing to fight the Global War on Terrorism at home and abroad, while sustaining the force and planning for its future. The ongoing process of transformation, primarily in the shift to a modular force of brigade combat teams, remained a priority for Army leaders. The  development  of  the  Future  Combat  Systems  initiative  was also part of the Army' s efforts at modernization and preparation for future conflicts, reflected by the amount of financial resources the service sought to devote to it. Recruiting and retention of soldiers challenged the Army throughout FY 2007, although the accession goals were for the most part met or exceeded. A key part of retention efforts included a renewed and aggressive program to support Army families, particularly with regard to housing. Repeated deployments, the stress of operations in The Long War, financial  constraints,  and  other  challenges  stressed  and  unbalanced  the Army. Nevertheless, Army leaders remained dedicated to fighting global terrorism with a force General Casey often referred to as 'The Strength of the Nation.'
