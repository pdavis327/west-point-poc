## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1997

## Introduction

## National Military Strategy

In May  1997  the  Clinton administration  issued A  National Security Strategy for a New Centwy, which set forth a  national  strategy designed to  advance U.S.  national  interests  in  an era  of unique  opportunities and multiple dangers.  Unparalleled  U.S.  military strength, a  dynamic global economy, and a growing community of democratic nations enhanced the prospects for  world  stability. At the  same time,  ethnic  conflicts, radical state  governments,  terrorism,  illegal  drug  trafficking,  organized  crime, and  nuclear weapons threatened  that stability. The three core objectives of the new national strategy were to enhance U.S. security with effective diplomacy and trained and ready military forces; to bolster U.S. economic prosperity; and to promote democracy throughout the world.

As a global power with global  interests, the United States must remain engaged with the world diplomatically, economically, and militarily. On the basis of national  strategy, an  overarcbing defense strategy  was  developed to meet the challenges of the current and future world, to identify military capabilities, and  to define needed programs and policies. The three pillars of the  defense  strategy  for  the  near  and  long  term  were  to  shape  the strategic environment and advance U.S. interests; to maintain the capability to  respond  to  the  full  spectrum of threats;  and  to prepare for  the  threats and  dangers  of an  uncertain  future.  The  military  shapes  the  strategic environment  by  promoting  regional  stability,  preventing  or  reducing conflicts and threats, and deterring aggression and coercion in key regions of the world.  United States forces, however, will sometimes be required to protect America's interests, demonstrate its resolve, and reaffirm its role as a global leader by deterring aggression and coercion in crises, conducting smaller-scale contingency operations, and, ultimately, fighting and winning major- theater wars.  At the  same time,  the  U.S.  military  must prepare to meet the  challenges  likely  to  exist  through  2015  by  pursuing a  focused modernization effort, exploiting the revolution in military and in business affairs, and planning for future threats.

To  fulfill  the  defense strategy,  the U.S. military  must maintain near› term capabilities to  shape the environment and respond to  threats  while developing the long-term capabilities to  respond  to  future  challenges. A capabilities-based force undertakes a range of operations in peace, crisis, or war; and must be capable of  conducting multiple missions, be proficient in  warfighting competencies, and  be able to mobilize quickly from peace to  war.  A  substantial overseas  presence remains vital for supporting  the defense strategy, as does the ability to rapidly move and concentrate U.S. military power around the world.  A well-trained force that enjoys a good quality  of life,  a  global  intelligence system that provides early strategic warning,  a  global  communications  system,  superiority  in  space,  and control of  the seas and airspace ensure these capabilities.

The Quadretmial  Defense Review  (QDR)  of 1997 stemmed  from  a May 1995 recommendation by the Commission on Roles and Missions of the U.S. AJmed Forces for a "quadrem1ial strategy review." In the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year  1997,  Congress  directed  the Department of Defense  to  conduct  a  QDR  and  provided  funds  for  it. The  secretary  of defense  expanded  the  concept  to  include  a  thorough review and assessment of military strategy, capabilities,  force  structure, infrastructure, resources, and  programs. He  established  panels with representatives from the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense, the Joint Staff~ and the services to conduct the review and make recommendations. On the basis of  these reconm1endations, the secretary of  defense made decisions, which he incorporated in a final  report to  Congress on 1  5 May 1997  The secretary envisioned that, through 2010, with the United States remaining the preeminent  military  power,  U.S. military  forces would  conduct peacekeeping,  crisis  response,  humanitarian  assistance,  disaster  relief, and  noncombatant evacuation operations. He reaffirmed the need for ten active Army divisions to execute two  nearly simultaneous major- theater wars. At the same time, he approved the QDR's conclusion that increased efficiencies and organizational changes allowed personnel reductions.

The Army's tasks in shaping the environment, responding to  threats, and  preparing  for  the  future  have  as  their  objectives  the  retention  of the  U.S.  initiative  in international  affairs,  the  capability  for  strategic preemption, and the ability to prevent debilitating conflicts. Because land forces  provide the most visible  and sustained forward  presence in other countries,  the Army's contacts  with  other nations and their land  forces contribute significantly in shaping the international security environment. The Army has provided the majority of  the military forces in twenty-seven operations since the end of the Cold War and will  continue to respond to  the  full  spectrum  of conflict.  The  decrease  in Total  Army  personnel required by the QDR will allow the Army to free funds for modernization of equipment in  preparation  for  the  future.  One  of the  most significant

aspects  of the  QDR  is  an  increase  in  modernization  funding  that will allow the Army to field a digitized corps by 2004.

In July  1996  the  chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff issued Joint Vision  2010, the armed forces' conceptual framework for future  military operations. The premise of Joint Vision  2010 is  that modern and emerging technologies,  especially  those  pertaining  to  information,  will  create  a new capability for joint operations. The massing of  forces will  decline in importance as joint force commanders acquire  the ability  to  pinpoint the decisive location and time for concentrating their  combat  power to defeat the enemy. Under Joint Vision 2010, U.S. forces are viewed as a team possessing full-spectrum dominance; that is, able to win against any opponent, in any situation, in any operation. The achievement of  the following operational concepts will ensure f11 ll-spectrum dominancedominant  maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional protection, and focused  logistics. Implementation of Joint Vision. 2010 will be achieved by providing common direction and  strategic  guidance  to  the  defense  community  and  guiding f11ture joint warfighting concepts and operational capabilities.

Army Vision 2010 is the  blueprint for the Army's contributions to the operational  concepts  identified  in Joint Vision  2010. The Army plans to leverage technologies to  achieve new  levels  of effectiveness  as  the  land forces component of  the joint warfighting team. To develop and maintain a  full-spectrum force,  the  Army  relies  on  the  fundamental  imperatives of obtaining quality  people;  establishing  effective  doctrines  for  military operations; creating the proper mix of  heavy, light, and special operations units,  supporting  elements,  and  sustaining  activities;  providing  a  high standard of  training; focusing  equipment modernization to support battlefield operations;  and  producing  quality leaders.  Maintaining  the readiness  to  respond  rapidly  to  worldwide  crises  is  the  Army's  highest priority; obtaining the proper force structure to meet mission requirements and  enhancing  quality  of  life  for  service  members  and  families  are also  essential.  To  ensure  full-spectrum  dominance,  the  Army  must  use digitization to achieve information dominance and must  make incremental improvements to current systems to attain capabilities overmatch.

The Army After Next (AAN)  wiLl  be  a  revolutionary  new  force  in which  light forces  will  become  more effective  and  heavy forces will  be redesigned to produce increased lethality, strategic mobility, and flexibility. Autonomous  platforms  and  space-based  systems  will  be  crucial  for battlefield success. Space will arise as a new battlefield. Designed to better understand the probable nature of  war thirty years in the future, the AA  N program is providing a focus  to  the Army's current development efforts. Tlu·ough  an  annual  cycle  of  war  games,  demonstrations,  experiments, exercises,  symposia,  workshops,  and  conferences,  the  AAN  initiative strives to Jay a research foundation for assessing the effects of increased

mobility, lethality,  and  maneuver.  By  leveraging  radical  advances in information technology,  weapons systems, and  vehicle speeds, the AAN program seeks to ensure that ground forces remain a strategically decisive element ofwarfighting. To develop the full-spectrum dominance needed in the future, technological advances will be examined to create "leap-ahead capabilities" beyond those currently envisioned.

Army  XXI  is  the force  that the Army  plans to field  by  20  I  0  as  an intermediate step  in  the process of developing the AAN.  As  the  twenty› first century force of  decision, the defining features of  Army XXI will  be its ability to compel victory, deter aggression, reassure allies, and support the national strategy. Army XXI will still be a power-projection force, but it  will  be  more  agile,  more  lethal,  and  more  capable  of providing  full› spectrum dominance. Emphasizing information dominance, the force will be digitized, enabling commanders and soldiers to exchange information in real time and obtain an up-to-date situational awareness of  the battlefield. Technologies added to combat systems and new information technologies will provide enhanced warfighting capabilities.

Force  XXI,  although  earlier  envisioned  as  a  discrete  force  design, evolved  into  the  Army's  ongoing  process  for  managing  change  and advancing into  the  twenty-first  century. Army Vision  2010 serves  as  a bridge  between Force XXI, the near-term  plan, and  the AAN,  the  long› term  objective.  To  achieve  full-spectrum  dominance  in  the  near  term, a  restructuring  of the  Army  was  required.  Force  XXI  is  the  process  of transforming the Army into a superior technological force for the twenty› first century that can attain information dominance. Through this process, the  Army  will  develop  the  right  doctrine  and  organizations,  realistic training,  appropriate sustainment packages,  and  the  best equipment and weapons systems possible.  Identifying the capabilities and  technological applications  needed  in  the  near  term,  Force  XXI  eschews  traditional methods  of development and provides new systems  in  a  fraction  of the time previously required. Flexibility, durability, and user-friendly systems will enhance deployability, sustai\_ nability, versatility, and protection of  the force. The product of the Force XXI process will be Army XXl, an Army poised to enter the twenty-first century.

## Highlights of  the Army :S' Activities

During FY  1997,  the Army continued  to  restructure  itself from  the forward-deployed force suitable for the Cold War to the power-projection force  needed  for  the  twenty-first  century.  The  drawdown  that  had  been taking place during the  1990s slowed considerably as all  elements of the Total Army  began  to  reach  their  mandated  personnel  levels.  Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  which had  begun  in  December 1995  in Bosnia, endured

throughout FY 97 as Operation JoiNT GuARD. This heavy commitment to a  protracted  contingency,  coupled  with  increasing  deployments  around the world, strained  the Army's budget. Although the Army remained able to  procure some new equipment, declining financial  resources and aging equipment forced  it to  rely  more  heavily  on  renovating  and  rebuilding equipment. The Army did make some progress in improving quality of  life and housing for its so. ldiers and family members, although the backlog of needed improvements remains monumental.

Sexual  harassment and  sexual  misconduct allegations colored much of the Army's public persona during the fiscal year. The highest ranking enlisted  soldier  in  the  Army  was  accused  of sexual  harassment  and sexual misconduct; he was suspended from his duties, and a  preliminary hearing was held to determine whether he should be court-martialed. Drill instructors were investigated for improprieties with basic trainees from the 1980s. The Army was forced to deal with these issues in a highly charged public  atmosphere,  under  intense  media  scrutiny.  Senior Army  leaders conducted a detailed study of sexual  harassment and  sexual misconduct, and various courts-martial were held. Some soldiers were discharged and sentenced to prison, whereas the majority received not,judicial punishment or administrative sanctions or were exonerated. As the number of  women in  the  active Army  has  increased,  rising  from  14.2  percent of the  active force  in  FY  1996  to  14.8  percent  in  FY  1997,  endeavors  to  create  a nonhostile  atmosphere  have  gained  in importance.  Women  remained excluded,  however, from  all Infantry, Armor, Special Forces,  and  Ranger positions, as well as some Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery roles. Nevertheless, progress was evident with  the  promotion of the first Army female to lieutenant general and the first assignment of  a female command sergeant  major to work for a lieutenant  general.  The  Character Development XXI initiative, in which  traditional Army values are imparted by  leaders and through training curricula, was another effort designed to  ensure that all  service members are treated with dignity and respect.

The  Army  budget's persistent  decline  was  evident  throughout  FY 1997,  with a  2.5  percent decrease from  FY  1996. Although  the  budget included funds for ongoing military contingencies and operations, it did not contain funding for unprogrammed missions. The Army revolutionized its business practices to find economies in some areas to support unfunded requirements in others. In one of  the most radical departures fl·om tradition, the  Army  turned  increasingly  to  privatization  of noncore competencies to  attract  private  funds  and  renovate  the  Army's aging  infrastructure. Some of the  most significant private  ventures  involved  the  replacement or modernization  of deteriorated family  housing,  which  vastly  improves the quality of life  for soldiers and  their families, and the privatization of utilities, which reduces the Army's  installation operating costs. Technology

played an  important role in assisting the Army in  wresting savings  from the  performance  of  necessary  functions.  The  Army  decreased  travel expenditures with the Lodging Success Program, which obtained volume discounts on  hotel  room rates for government travelers. The  Government Travel Card reduced the need for travel advances.

In  addition  to  lower personnel levels for each component of the Total Army that  the  1993  Bottom-Up  Review  (BUR)  had  recommended,  the QDR recommended and the secretary of  defense directed 93,700 additional cuts through  FY 2006, with  nearly  half of the reductions  in  the  reserve components and more than  one-third  in  the civilian workforce. The Total Army consisted of 1,321 ,300 active Army, U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), Army National  Guard  (ARNG), and  civilian members at the end  of FY 1997, compared with 1,345,900 when  the fiscal year  began, a  2  percent reduction  involving  24,600  personnel.  With  491 ,700  troops,  the  active Army met its  BUR goal of 495,000 and  was slightly over its  QDR goal of  490,000 for the year. · usAR had 2 12,900 soldiers and was on schedule to  reach  its  BUR goal  of 208,000 for  FY  1998. Remaining stable during the year with 370,000 personnel, ARNG had 3,000 more troops than  its BUR goal.  Reductions in  the reserve components under the QDR are not scheduled to begin until FY 1998. The number of  civilians declined in an effort to reach the BUR goal of236,000 by FY 2001, standing at 246,700 at the end of  FY 1997.

Although  the Army  continued  to  restructure  its  forces  to  meet the requirements of  Force XXI, the number of  divisions remained stable, with ten active Army and eight ARNG divisions. A decrease of four separate brigades occurred in FY 1997, leaving the total at eighteen. As a result of the QDR, USAR and ARNG will be decreased by 45,000 persons over the next few years. ARNG contains more than half  of the Total Army's  combat force  and  USAR  more than one-third of the combat support and combat service  support  units.  Planners  have  recognized  that  the  infrastructure contains  an  insufficient  level  of combat  support  and  combat  service support units for the capabilities-based and force-projection Army of the future.  Moreover, the prevalence of  joint operations has created a need for units that  are capable of integrating active and reserve forces and achieving interopcrabil ity with other military services. fn line with the Army National Guard Division Redesign Study, two active/ARNG integrated divisions will be formed over the next fourteen years from up to  twelve ARNG combat brigades and support elements from two divisions that will be converted to combat support and combat service support units.

Throughout  FY  1997  the Army  endeavored  to  maintain  or  improve readiness of its personnel, equipment, systems, and installations to ensure that it would have  the  capability to conduct  two major-theaterwars in different parts of  the world simultaneously. Switching from the forward-based Army

of the  Cold War required  that power-projection platforms  be  established at many installations in  the United States. At the end of FY  1997, fifteen installations had been prepared and equipped to serve as power-projection platforms, and an additional twelve installations were designated as power› support platforms that would perform initial mobilization and training for reserve  component units. Under the Army's new  philosophy to fund  and equip units that deploy early in contingencies, combat service support units have begun to receive a higher priority for funding within the Total Army. Funding  constraints reduced the Army's ability  to  conduct programmed levels of  training in combat vehicles, measured as ground operating tempo, and forced the Army to reduce the flying-hom program for all aircraft except attack helicopters. To better determine the full cost  of  preparing a unit  to go to war, theAnny has developed a new measure termed Operational Readiness. In  a  significant  improvement  in  readiness,  however,  the  fully  mission› capable rates of  the Army's  sixteen major weapons systems, particularly the MlA2 Abrams tank and Army helicopters, increased from FY 1996 to FY 1997. Improving training while reducing costs, the Army Distance Learning Program  expanded  operations and will  eventually  provide 95  percent of all soldiers with standardized training within an hour's drive of  their home station. Using other advanced technology tools, simulators and simulations provided increased training opportunities at the individual, unit, and higher headquarters levels at a fraction of  the cost of live exercises. An emphasis on physical training has not declined, however, as the Army Physical Fitness Test standards were revised, making the measures tougher for women in the Army's bid to attain gender equity.

The  Army  of the  past  year  was  a  highly  mobile  force,  engaged  in numerous  contingency  and humanitarian  missions around the globe. Personnel tempo was  at an all-time high,  as soldiers deployed  from their home stations for six months at a time, despite the Army's goal of limiting their absences to a total of  four months in one year.  On any given day in FY 1997, atJ  average of  6 percent of  the active Army was operationally deployed to  nearly  80  countries.  Special  Operations  Forces  personnel,  who  were highly prized for  their skills, pei-formed  missions  for  U.S. ambassadors  in 144 countries. Another 120,000 soldiers were stationed permanently outside of the  United  States.  In  addition,  thousands  of active Army,  USAR,  and ARNG soldiers engaged in large-scale training exercises in the continental United States (CONUS) and in every major command area of  responsibility. Partnership  exercises,  in  which  Total  Army  soldiers  trained  with  those from other countries, provided opportunities for developing new skills and building  relations  with  prospective  allies.  Reserve  component  personnel were particularly involved in nation-building exercises, in which their skills were honed while they constructed tangible infrastructure improvements or provided  basic services for the indigenous population.

Thousands of  soldiers remained deployed to Bosnia in FY  1997 and, in support of  them, thousands to Hungary and hundreds to Croatia. Troops had initially  been  mobilized in  December  1 995 for Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR to  support the North  Atlantic Treaty  Organization in monitoring a peace agreement in  Bosnia. This was  the largest mobilization of soldiers since Operation  DESERT  STOR M.  Active /\rmy  units  stationed  in Germany  were deployed to  Bosnia, and in some cases mobilized USAR and ARNG units were deployed to Germany to assume those units'  mission. As active Army units  returned  to  Germany,  USAR and ARNG units  from  CONUS were often sent directly to Bosnia. In December  L  996 the treaty implementation force  became  a  stabilization  force  under  Operation  JoiNT  GuARD,  with thirty-nine nations participating.  United  States soldiers  in Bosnia served primarily  in  the  Multinational  Division  (North),  composed  of separate brigades  from  the  United  States,  Russia, Turkey,  and  Norway/Poland. In addition  to  carrying  out  the  mission,  many Total Army  personnel  have become intimate with interopcrability and combined operations as a result of their experiences,  which will  better prepare the Army  for  activities  of this type in  the future.

As  the  Army  moves  towards  the  twenty-first  century,  it  has  been restructuring  its  forces  to  exploit  information  technology,  particularly in  weapons  systems, and  is planning to  digitize  its  divisions  and  corps. The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was selected as the experimental force  (EXFOR) for Force XXI. Throughout the fiscal  year, thousands  of pieces  of new  equipment were  fielded  to  the  EXFOR with  concomitant training provided to  the division's soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas.  In March 1997  the Army's largest and most signi l'icant experiment,  the Task Force XXI  Advanced  Warfighting  Experiment,  took  place  at  the National Training  Center  in  Fort  Irwin,  California,  incorporating  new  military doctrine,  organizational structures, technologies, processes,  systems, and  equipment.  A  combination  of computer  technologies,  information networks,  intelligence  systems,  and  simulation  technologies  resulted  in a  vastly  improved  situational  awareness  of the  battlefield,  both  enemy and  friendly,  that  tactical  commanders  have  been  demanding  for  years. Eleven  Force XXI initiatives were fielded and tested during the Advanced Wadlghting  Experiment and deemed  to require urgent funding under the new  Warftghting Rapid Acquisition Program. The Army requested $100 million to develop the programs in an expedited fashion for field ing of  the first Army XXI division by September 2000.

Because of  the Army's heavy rei iance on automation to shoot, move, and communicate effectively, the service gave increasing emphasis during the year to  resolving with  the year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem. Since the  1960s, a standard computer programming practice had  been to identify 1he year with two digits (for example, 97 for  1997), with  the inherent fault

of systems  interpreting 00  as  1 900  instead  of 2000.  Thus  the  beginning of the  year 2000  threatens  to  cause  widespread  miscalculation  of data. Addressing this  problem  in March  1997,  the secretary  of the Army  and the chief  of staff of  the Army assigned top priority to analyzing its extent, fixing and  testing affected systems, and certifying the  results. They noted, however,  that  these  efforts  to  make  systems Y2K  compliant  had  to  be carried out with existing funds.

AstheArmydownsizedfollowingtheendoftheColdWar,oldequipment was eliminated, leaving the force with a modern inventory dating from  the 1980s. By the end ofFY J 997, however, this equipment had aged and was on the verge of  becoming obsolete. Equipment modernization had become critical, but sufficient funds were not available to fill all of  the Army 's  needs. Although the Army did not cancel any major weapons systems in FY 1997, it  limited  procurement  of some  items  and  lengthened  the  development periods  of others  in  an  effort  to  stretch  resources.  The establishment of the  Army  XXI  Acquisition  Reform  Reinvention  Laboratory,  designed as  a  virtual  laboratory  to  reform  the  acquisition  process,  succeeded  in reducing acquisition times  for some system moclif1. cations, which  in  turn reduced  costs. To  further decrease  the costs  of modernization, the Army relied  on  recapitalization;  that  is,  replacing  or  refitting  worn  or  dated equipment. This process  refurbished one-fifth  ofAR.NG's aircraft. At the same time, the Army was able to sustain development for new air defense, missile, artillery,  intelligence, support vehicle, and command  and control systems,  with  the  Crusader field  artillery  system  remaining  the Army's top  development  program  for  ground  combat  systems.  In  addition,  the Army continued equipping ARNG's fifteen  Enhanced  Separate Brigades expected to be fully operational by FY  1999. One of  the Army's significant ach\_ievernents was the fielding of  digitized technical manuals on a variety of combat,  wheeled,  and  aviation  systems,  reducing  the  need  to  carry hundreds of  pounds of  manuals to the field. With the revolution in military logistics, the Army gained savings by decreasing stockpiles of  equipment, gaining visibility of  goods, and improving its distribution system.

With  operation  of the  Army's $ I 00  bill ion  of real  property  and  12 million acres of land costing $10 billion a year, or one-third of the Army's discretionary  funds, it is essential  that costs be  eradicated  wherever possible. ARNG and USAR alone operate and maintain more than 22,000 installations and facilities. As a result of  the QDR conclusion that additional installation  infrastructure  could  be  eliminated,  two  additional  rounds  of Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  decisions  have  been  scheduled for  200  l  and  2005.  By  the  end  of FY 1997,  80  percent  of all  BRAC closings  required  in  CONUS,  and  95  percent of those  required  overseas, had  been  accomplished.  During  the fiscal  year,  for  the  first  time,  the Army saved more on  the BRAC process than it expended. Through  the

Facility  Reduction Program, the Army is working to eliminate unneeded buildings to decrease operational  expenses, but this program cost $100 mill ion  in  FY  I  997  rather  than  providing savings.  Because  the  Army has continued to receive insufficient money to adequately replace family housing and  barracks,  operating and  maintaining  aging  structures  has captured an ever-increasing amount of  Army funds. In FY 1997 the Army did  manage to  revitalize 1,746 fam ily housing units, design or construct 22,000  barracks  spaces,  and modernize  additional I  0,600 barracks spaces. In  one effort  to  economi:.ce,  the  Army developed Service Based Costing, an analysis of the resources consumed for  122 typical services provided at military installations, and  collected  its  first  full  set of data from 77  installations in  FY  1997.

## Organization and Management

## Organizational Changes

## Organizations

In  1967  the  Office  of the Assistant Vice  Chief of Staff of the Army (OAVCSA) was created to guide and integrate Department of the Army (DA) efforts in resource management. In 1974 OAVCSA and the secretary to the General Staff  were replaced by a newly created director of  the Army Staff.  In 1995  the Army  considered reestablishing OAVCSA  to compete with  sister services for  defense  funds.  In  September 1996  the  president approved the reinstatement of the position of assistant vice chief of staff of the  Army  (AVCSA).The AVCSA  was  charged  with  developing  and articulating the Army's requirements and, pursuant to the direction of the assistant secretary of the Army (financial  management and comptroller) (ASA [FM&amp;C]), helping to integrate military requirements into the overall planning and programming process. In October 1996 the director of the Army Staff proposed that the AVCSA  acquire oversight of the Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate and of  the Concepts Analysis Agency. By  the  end  of FY  1997,  this  issue  remained  in  contention among  the administrative assistant to  the secretary of  the Army, the general counsel, theASA (FM&amp;C), and the deputy under secretary oftheArmy (operations research). Also unresolved was tbe potential infringement of  ASA (FM&amp;C) duties and responsibilities by the new AVCSA.

Technological advances also create a demand for new  organizations. The  1997 Army After Next (AAN) winter war games demonstrated that space and information  operations will  not only  be critical  to success  on the future  battlefield, but will dominate on occasion. Space control, space policy, space reliability, and space vulnerability have  become significant issues.  Jn  particular,  the  ability  to  conduct reconnaissance and  counter› reconnaissance in space will affect the outcome of  a war.  With space and missile defense becoming even more essential, the U.S. Army Space and Strategic  Defense  Command  (SSDC)  reorganized  into  the  U.S.  Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) and published Vision 2010.

Responsible  for  unifying  the  Army's space and  missile  defense  efforts, SMDC will bring space support to the joint war  fighter and national missile defense  to  the  continental  United  States  (CONUS)  while  continuing  to develop theater missile defense.

In  a  major organizational change, the Personnel Information Systems Command  (PERSINSCOM)  and  its  field  operating  agencies  became subordinate elements  of  the U.S. Total Army  Personnel Command (PERSCOM) as of I October 1996. Although PERSINSCOM's name was changed to  the Personnel  Information Systems Directorate (PERSINSD), no significant changes in mission, funding, or personnel occurred. The U.S. Army Information Systems Command- U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command  (USAISC- USMEPCOM)  was  a  field  operating  agency  of PERSINSCOM.  Its  role  was  to furnish  communications  electronics support  to  Headquarters,  U.S.  Military  Entrance  Processing  Command (USMEPCOM), and to sixty-five military  entrance-processing  stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. In addition, the organization was responsible for ordering all  telephone services for USMEPCOM. On I October 1996, PERSCOM approved the transfer ofUSAISC- USMEPCOM employees to Headquarters, USMEPCOM, and the move occurred early in 1997.

At the beginning ofFY 1997, PERSCOM was authorized 2,869 military and civilian personnel. During the fiscal year, 412 personnel authorizations were transferred to PERSCOM from major commands (MACOM) and the Software Development Center- Washington  to  support  the  regionalization of  civilian personnel offices. All but six of  these authorizations, along with another lwenty-nine,  were  later transferred  to  the  Office  of the Assistant Secretary  of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs). An  increase of 39 authorizations to PERSCOM occurred in the Casualty and Memorial Affairs Operations Center, Prisoner  ofWar/Missing inAction, and 116 authorizations for the  Central  Identification  Mission in  Hawaii when  the  Central  Identification Laboratory Concept Plan was approved. In a major reorganization, the U.S. Army Information System  Management Activity  transferred 897 positions to  PERSCOM.  By  using  the  Voluntary  Early  Retirement  Authority  and the Civilian Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, PERSCOM reduced its  civilian strength  by  34  personnel.  With 3  additional  authorizations  lost through  other changes, PERSCOM's total  authorization at the end  of FY 1997 was 3,861 military and civilian personnel.

The Colonels  Division  in  PERSCOM,  which  had been  responsible for  colonel  assignments,  was  inactivated  in  June  1997  and  replaced  by the  Colonels  Distribution  Branch. The Colonels  Distribution  Branch  is subordinate to the Distribution Division but works directly for the director, Officer  Personnel  Management  Directorate  (OPMD).  Although  career divisions  within OPMD were given the responsibility to  assign colonels, the Colonels  Distribution Branch has become the focal point for colonel

assignments. It manages the requirements and assignments of  colonels to flll the  Officer  Distribution  Plan  in  the  Army,  in  joint  accounts,  and  in positions located outside the  Department  of Defense  (DOD).  In  pursuit of its  mission, the Colonels Distribution  Branch has established relations with MACOM and non-DOD agencies.

In  June  1997  PERSCOM's Office  of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for Operations experienced a major reorganization when the Force Integration and Analysis Division and the Military Operations Division were divided into  the  Mobilization  Division,  the  Force  Integration  Division,  and  the Training  and  Analysis  Division.  The  Current  Operations  Branch  was established under the Office of the  Deputy Chief of Staff for  Operations to coordinate all cross-directorate actions witbjn PERSCOM. In addition to  providing support to Operation JorNT GuARD, the Mobilization Division participated in exercises and in contingency planning.  The Force Integration Division published Army  force structure changes and  several  new Army regulations. The Training and Analysis Division assisted in  the transition to  the  Officer  Personnel  Management  System  XXI  and  participated  in developing the Aviator Continuation Pay program.

In  April  1995  Executive Order  1 2958 established  new guidelines for classifying,  safeguarding, reviewing, downgrading,  and  declassifying national security  information,  and  for  exempting  some  materials  from declassification.  Agencies were required  to  review , for declassification  or exemption, all  classified  information  in  permanent  records  dated  before 1974.  Documents  not  reviewed  would  be  declassified  automatically  in April  2000.  The  Army  established  an  Army  Declassification  Activity (ADA) in June 1996 to review its 270 million pages of  classified material. During FY  1997,  the ADA  reviewed  more than  10,000  document pages and  declassified  more  than  6,000. It also  provided  support  to  the  John F. Kennedy  Assassination  Records  Review  Board  and  the  Freedom  of Information and Privacy Act programs.

ln response  to a study  recommending that  the Army Review  Boards Agency (ARBA) increase accountability, reduce the number of  old cases, improve  morale, and  incorporate  new  technology,  ARB/\  created  a  new Top Management Team and purchased  a new  tracking system to provide accountability  of all  correspondence.  New ARBA  screening teams  were established in St. Louis, Missouri, and Arlington, Virginia.  Renovation of facilities  was  completed  in  St.  Louis and  was  under way  in  Arlington.  Jn FY  1997, ARBA's Clemency and Parole Board paroled 22.8 percent of  the persons whose cases it  reviewed. Army soldiers constituted 69 percent of all  military inmates who were paroled  in  FY 1997.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 1997 required the  secretary of defense  to  form  a National Defense Panel to  assess  the Quadrennial Defense  Review (QDR)  . . n May  1997, with  the completion I

of the QDR, the Strategic Synchronization Cell  in  OAVCSA, which had assisted  the AVSCA  in  directing  and  integrating  the  1997  QDR  effort throughout  the  Army  Staff,  was  reorganized  to  support  the  work  of the  National  Defense Panel  and  renamed  the  Center  for Land Warfare. Consisting of a director's office, an  analysis and integration team, and a visualization team, the center is a cross-functional organization reporting to  the AVCSA. The Center for Land Warfare will provide an integrated view of  Army requirements and improve the Army's ability to articulate those requirements in DOD  resource  debates, including the Joint Requirements Oversight Council  and the Joint Warfighting  Capabilities Analysis panels.

During a  1996  study  on  restructuring  Headquarters,  Department of the  Army (HQDA), the Army Science Board recommended transferring management  of nonmajor  acquisition  programs  to  the  Army  Materiel Command (AM  C).  In FY 1996, AMC accepted a total of  seven programs from the Information Support Command. During FY 1997, about eighteen program, project, and product managers (collectively, PM) transferred into AMC, raising the total of  AMC PMs to sixty. The program executive officer for Standard Army Management Information Systems and associated PMs are scheduled to h·ansfer into AMC during FY 1 998.

The Operational Test and Evaluation Command (OPTEC) developed the  OPTEC System Team  (OST)  in  FY  1997  to  support  the  Integrated Test and Evaluation process for every active program that requires OPTEC testing or evaluation. When an OPTEC element identifies such a program, a lead office is appointed to establish an OST that will develop the OPTEC test and evaluation strategy. An OST is composed of representatives from the Operational Evaluation Command, the Evaluation Analysis Center, and the Test and  Experimentation  Command  who are involved in evaluating, testing, or experimenting with a particular program. An OST also includes personnel from the appropriate OPTEC Test and Evaluation Coordination Office and, when necessary, from the OPTEC Threat Support Activity or the Test and Evaluation Command. The OST provides a forum at the action officer level to  coordinate issues and  resolve problems, or raise  them to higher  levels, and  is  empowered  to  take  actions  that are  consistent with OPTEC and Army policies and positions.

One  Army organizational change resu lted from a decreased workload.  Experiencing  a  reduction  of its  testing  mission  since  the beginning of FY  1996,  the  U.S. Army  Corps  of Engineers  (USACE) possessed  more  laboratory space than  it could support.  In May  1997 USACE completed a  review of its laboratory activities  that indicated that most laboratories were operating at a net loss and would continue to  do  so.  T he  review  recommended  that  existing  laboratories  should be  consolidated  at one  location,  with  one-third  of the  personnel  and

equipment.  In  July  1997,  the  commander,  USACE,  decided  to  close six of the seven  laboratories as  soon  as possible,  but no  later than 30 September  1998, and consolidate their activities in  Omaha, Nebraska. Five  of the  laboratories  were  closed  during  FY  1997,  saving  $5.3 million in future annual operating losses.

In the U.S.  Southern  Command  (USSOUTHCOM),  some  large units were inactivated in preparation for eliminating the U.S.  presence in Panama by 31 December 1999. By the end ofFY 1997, the 470th Military Intelligence  Brigade,  the  Military  Police  Command,  the  1  06th  Signal Brigade, the 536th Engineer Battalion, the 92d Military Police Battalion, and the  154th Signal Battalion had  been  inactivated. The remaining U.S. Army, South (USARSO), units,  many of  which had declined in size fi·om battalions  to  companies  or  companies  to  detachments,  were  organized under a new theater support brigade. With the USARSO staff, the theater support brigade, composed of  combat, combat support, and combat service support units, will plan, coordinate, and execute USSOUTHCOM's  theater engagement strategy.

Several Army bands were reftagged during FY 1997. In October 1996 the 2d Armored Division Band at Fort Hood was renamed the 4th Infantry Division Band, and the 2d Infantry Division Band at Fort Stewart, Georgia, became  the  3d Infantry  Division  Band.  A  month  later,  the  3d Infantry Division Band in  Bamberg, Germany, was  reftagged as  the  1st Armored Division Band. As the result of the Change in Noncommissioned Offl.cer Structure Study, the noncommissioned officer composition of  Army bands was reviewed and revised.

## Ins  tallat  ions

When DOD closed major military installations in the  1960s, it did not consider  the  effect  upon  communities.  Legislation  in  the  1970s  ensured that Congress would  be  involved  in  future  closings.  In  1988  the secretary of defense  chartered  a  Commission  on  Base  Realignment  and  Closure (BRAC) to make recommendations. Later that year, Congress required that DOD  implement  the  recommendations.  The  Defense  Base  Closure  and Realignment Act of 1990 directed  that additional  BRAC (the  acronym is commonly applied, despite variations in title) commissions be convened in 1991, 1993, and J  995. Closing unnecessary installations has saved the Army considerable resources and enabled it to  be positioned for Force XXI.  Full implementation of all  four commissions'  findings was expected to save $1 billion annually. Approving the QDR's fi11ding  that additional infrastructure could be eliminated, the secretary of defense proposed that two additional rounds of  base  closures take place in 1999 and2001 .As  of  the end ofFY  1997, congressional opponents had  been successful in blocking the proposal.

BRAC  implementation  continued in FY  1997  with the Army saving more during the year than  it  had  spent on the  process of closing and  consolidating  bases.  By  the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  the  Army  had accomplished .about  80  percent  (91  of 112)  of the  scheduled  BRAC closings in  the United States and  had returned to  host nations 95 percent of identified installations  overseas.  Vint Hill  Farms Station in Virginia, the  only Army installation selected  for closure in  the FY 1993  process, lowered its flag in June 1997, two years earlier than planned. Its primary tenants  moved to  Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and to Tobyhanna Army Depot,  Petmsylvania.  The  largest  BRAC  construction  project,  which allocated $160 mill  ion for new facilities at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, continued during FY 1997 to support the Military Police and  Chemical Schools being transferred from Fort McClellan, Alabama.  In April  1997 the Army leased the former Fitzsimons Army Medical Center to the city of  Aurora, Colorado, where the University of Colorado  will  transform it into the fourth academic medical center and research park in the country. Most of the acreage of Cameron Station, Virginia, was sold to a  private developer,  and  the  remainder was  transferred  to  the city of Alexandria; the existing structures were razed to make way for 2,000 residential units, commercial space, and recreational facilities.

As a  result  of BRAC 95,  Fort  Pickett, Virginia,  and Fort  Chaffee, Arkansas, were closed and realigned to the Army National Guard (ARNG) in  1997. The  BRAC commission  had  recommended  the  installations  be closed except for  minimum essential ranges, facilities, and training areas needed as a  training enclave for individual and  annual training. ARNG's Maneuver Training  Center  at  Fort  Pickett  consists  of forty  thousand maneuver  acres,  with  billets  for  four  thousand  soldiers.  It  can support training for a brigade-size element during peak annual training months or for two or more battalions during inactive duty training periods. The Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center contains sixty-two thousand acres and has  billets to support up  to one brigade with  attached  elements. Training capabilities  include Jane  training (training of company and smaller units on a series of  selected soldier, leader, and collective tasks, using a specific terrain), artillery firing, engineer demolitions, bridging operations, and small  arms  range  firing.  Fort Dix,  New  Jersey,  and  its  subordinate organizations transferred from U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) to the U.S. Army Reserve Command on l  October 1997.

In preparation for  the departure of U.S.  troops from Panama, Quarry Heights,  the  Curundu  Flats  housing  area,  and  Gorgas  Army  Hospital were transferred to the Panamanian government during FY  1997. Almost half of all  Army properties had  been transferred  by  the  end of the  fiscal year,  and  the  remaining  transfers  are  expected  to  be  on  schedule.  The USSOUTHCOM headquarters became fully operational in its new Miami

location. Unaccompanied soldiers were stationed at Fort Sherman, Panama, and  accompanied personnel  were  assigned  to  Fort  Clayton,  Fort  Kobbe, and Corozal Army Complex, all in Panama.

Under  a  presidential  initiative  in 1993  and  the  National Defense Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year 1994,  the  secretary  of  the  Army was  authorized  to  transfer  installation  property  to  promote  economic redevelopment in  communities surrounding an  installation  being closed. After  reviewing  a  local  reuse  authority  (LRA)  business  plan,  the Army could establish a payment plan under an economic development conveyance (EDC). The Fort Benjamin Jlarrison Reuse Authority received an EDC in FY  1996  to  purchase Fort  Benjamin  Harrison,  Indiana,  for  $6.1  million paid over ten years. In early  1997 the LRA  began comprehensive rezoning of  the site, which would provide a new state park, a town center, and a golf course, as well as employ six thousand people.

With  the  closing  of Fort  Devens,  Massachusetts,  the Army  retained the  Devens  Reserve  Forces Training Area  but  transferred  other parts to the Department of  Labor, the Federal Bureau ofPrisons, and the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service. In  November  1995, the Massachusetts Government Land Bank requested an  EDC for the remaining thirty-four hundred acres in  November  I995. In  May  1997,  the state  began  paying  the Army  the agreed price of  $17.9 million over six  years  in  six installments.  Since the conveyance, twenty-six  hundred jobs have been created.

Another  EDC  was  approved  in  FY  1997  for  the  Defense  Personnel Support  Center  Clothing  Factory in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  The Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development purchased the property for $650,000, to be paid  in  installments as buildings arc conveyed.  Bright Star Manufacturing will  usc the facility and employ six  hundred  persons to produce Christmas ornaments.

## Management and ll1fonnation Systems

## Personnel Management

As  a  result  of  DOD reviews  of  military  recru·ttng  and major automated  information  systems,  the  Army  began  to  develop  the  Joint Recruiting  Information  Support  System  (JRISS)  in 1994  to  provide common  automation  for  military  recruiting  services.  The Information Support Activity- U.S. Army Recruiting Command continued to manage this  multiservice  effort  during  FY 1997.  The  JRISS  program  would incorporate  new,  cost-efficient technologies,  including  a  working  data dictionary  under  development  containing eleven  hundred  standardized data elements./\ recruiter workstation, which would include an automated sales presentation on a laptop, was also being developed. Limited DOD

funding and a recognition that commonality could not be achieved easily, however, forced abandonment of  the joint project.

The  Army  decided  to  refocus  its  efforts  on  the  Army  Recruiting Information  Support  System  (ARJSS),  reintroducing  the  objectives  of 1\rmy  Recruiting 2000. ARJSS  incorporates  new  business practices and information technology, resulting in  a system that offers single data entry; a common database and operating environment using DOD standardized data; and commercial off-the-shelf  software and hardware. Three thousand  laptop systems  were deployed  to  brigade and  training support organizations. With automated presentations and business functions on the laptop, recruiters are more mobile and can spend more time in  recruiting markets rather than in the office.

l . n January  1997  the  United  States  Army  Recruiting  Command's (USAREC)  Headquarters Support System (HSS) was approved as a service-unique  subsystem that VSAREC  would  own  and  operate. Although al l services conduct the same  activities with respect to recruiting,  the  procedures  and  philosophy  they  follow  arc  diff erent and affect  how  they accomplish  their  mission. The HSS  project  includes all USAREC automation procedures not associated with accession. A user› friendly system, it will provide timely information down to battalion level, using a  single  database and  common data  entry.  USAREC  was  able  to rccngineer the HSS applications immediately to newer technology, which will eliminate old equipment and duplicate systems while providing more accessible  information.

The Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPM!S) provides the capability to update personnel data on commissioned and warrant officers in the Total Army Personnel Database› Active  Officer  (TAPDB-AO).  TOPMIS  is  used  only  for  updates  that occur  on-line;  the  Total  Officer  Personnel  Transaction  Update  System (TOPTUS) processes transactions using a main computer. UsingTOPMIS, the TAPDB- AO can be updated twenty-four hours a day from  J -IQDA or from  personnel  service centers worldwide. The system can  update more than three hundred personnel data items and provide immediate feedback to personnel managers. Maintenance  of  TOPMIS during FY 1997 included the development and implementation of more than one hundred Engineering Change Proposals/Problem Reports. Extensive modifications in all  TOPMIS  modules  were  made  to  support  the  elimination  of the Colonels Division. Additional work continued in designing and developing software to provide daily updates of  officer data in TOPMlS 11, which will be a client-server system instead of  the mainframe-based TO  PM  IS.

For  several  decades, the Army  used  the  Officer Master  rile (OMF), a late  1 960s  batch  processing  computer system,  to  update  officer personnel data.  The  system  processed  S!DPERS-2  (Standard Installation/ Division

Personnel System) transactions and stored them at HQDA. On a weekly basis, PERSJNSCOM collected input data, processed  it through sixty  interrelated programs,  and  then  posted  the  data.  During  FY  1993,  in  preparation  for SIDPERS-3, the OMF was redesigned to apply batch updates directly to the TAPDB-AO,  requiring  550  new edit,  update, and  feedback  modules.  With the  redesign, OMF  was  renamed  TOPTUS,  and TAPDB-AO  became  the central officer personnel database,  with  transactions  processed  twice daily and posted directly. More than 200 Engineering Change Proposals- Software/ Problem Reports were developed and implemented forTOPTUS. During FY 1997 analysis of  how to  include Exceptional Family Member Program data into daily updates was accomplished. In addition, automated extracts of  active duty military personnel records were interfaced into TOPTUS, providing the Defense Manpower Data Center with weekly deployment information. Using TOPTUS, missing security data of  nearly twenty-eight thousand officers were captured during FY  1997, and  sixty  thousand  records of separated  offtcers were deleted rather than remaining on TAPDB- AO indefinitely.

The new Officer Evaluation  Report (OER) tries to eliminate inflated ratings resulting from the drawdown, encourage junior officer professional development, and emphasize institutional values and  the  need  for regular counseling. The Officer Evaluation  Reporting System- Enhanced (OERS› E) database  is  designed  to  receive,  log, track, and manage the new OER and  Academic Evaluation  Reports.  Implemented on 30  September 1997, the objectives of  Phase 1  for OERS- E were to move from a mainframe to a cl ient-scrvcr, modify forms packages and the data entry system, scan  OERs, process  images, apply  senior  rater  profiles, and  produce  initial  reports. More  than  two  hundred  data  clements were  standardized. The  OERS- E data  structures,  physical model, and  other documentation  were  provided to the  U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) and ARNG for future implementation. The Officer Selection Support System, a menu-driven automated system, provides a  means  to  process  data  for  promotions, school  selections, and special boards. In FY  1997, this system supported  133 promotion boards.

Under  DOD  Regulation  5200.2- R, Personnel  Security  Program, a periodic reinvestigation is  required every five years for personnel holding a  top  secret  security  clearance and  not  earlier  than  every  ten  years  for those with a secret clearance. The Army conducts periodic reinvestigations for  personnel  holding secret clearances  every  fifteen  years,  under Army Regulation  380- 67. InFY I  996, the Defense Investigative Scrviccsetannual quotas for periodic reinvestigations for each military service to  reduce the workload in light of  reductions in the investigative persoru1cl workforce. Tn October 1996 the U.S. Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility established an  initial submission schedule and instructions for submitting periodic reinvestigations. Having received a low submission rate in the first quarter of FY  1997, the central clearance facility accelerated the required

submission  rate  for  the rest of the fiscal  year. The Total Army  exceeded its quota of  7,600 periodic reinvestigations for top secret clearances, with 9,189  opened  in FY 1997;  however,  its  quota of 14,000 secret periodic reinvestigations was not met and only  11,4 l 5 were opened.

The Retiree Mobilization Preassignment and Recall Program has  received new  support  through  the  redesigned Retiree  Volunteer Preassignment System  (RVPS).  Using RVPS,  experienced retired Army personnel  suitable  for  mobilization  can  be  identified  in  the Total  Army Personnel  Database- Reserve  (TAPDB- R)  for  valid  requirements  of the Office of  the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Operations and Plans. Assignments can be made or reversed, reports produced, and requirements and personnel data  reviewed  using  the TAPDB- R.  Although  the  functional proponent normally  assigns  the  retiree,  the  RVPS  can  assign  the  retiree  to  an available requirement in the state in which the retiree resides. On the basis of requirements  received  from  PERSCOM, RVPS  can select  and  order retirees  to  mobilization  stations.  The  core  database  for  the  Total  Army Personnel Database (TAPDB) supports worldwide queries for all  levels of crisis or mobilization. During FY 1997, all  requirements for RVPS  were analyzed, and systems specifications, unit specifications, and programming code were completed. In addition, regulatory and legal changes and other technical  improvements,  including some addressing the year 2000 (Y2K) problem, were made.

## Information Management

The  Army Enterprise  Architecture (AEA) is an integrated methodology and fl-amework that  affects all Army  systems  using,  producing,  or exchanging information electronically.  TheAEA is essential in establishing seamless interoperability and digitizing a division in 2000, a corps in 2004, and the active Army in 20 l  0.  It will provide the  information  technology architecture for Army XXI and AAN and supports the goal of  information superiority articulated  in Joint Vision  2010. The AEA supports the  1993 Army  Enterprise  Vision,  and  fulfills  the  1996  legislative  requirements for  information  technology  architecture.  Under  the AEA,  systems  with interoperable information technology will require less human intervention. In addition, AEA will identify and prevent system redundancies.

The three components of  AEA are the Army Operational Architecture (AOA),  the  Army  Systems Architecture (ASA),  and  the  Joint Technical Architecture- Army (JTA- A).  TheAOA consists of  the total aggregation of missions, functions, tasks,  information requirements, and business rules. The  physical  implementation of the AOA  is  accomplished by  the ASA, which provides the layout and relationship of  systems and communications. The JTA- A provides the building codes upon which the systems are based.

In FY  1997, the Army developed the AEA Master Plan; completed version 1.0  of the  ASA  for  the  Lst  Digitized  Force;  completed  versions 4.5  and 5.0 of  the JTA- A; and  initiated the Installation Information  Infrastructure Architecture  (PA).  Execution  of ABA  is  accomplished  by  the Training and  Doctrine  Command  (TRADOC),  (AMC),  and  the  Directorate  of rnformation Systems for Command,  Control,  Communications, and Computers (DISC 4 ).

In the DOD Appropriations Act for PiscaiYear 1997, Congress required the  services  to  submit  an  automation  master  plan  for  the  installation level  by I  May  1997. The Army  Base  Level  C"/IT (Command, Control, Communications, and  Computer/Information Technology)  Infrastructure Transition Roadmap was developed as a framework for a system that would provide  information exchange at the  installation  level. The roadmap will be  implemented on  I November  1997. The PA, initiated as part of  AEA, and the integrated infrastructure investment strategy are two  key clements of  the road  map. The PA will  provide information necessary for investment in  or acquisition of installation  infrastructure, data exchange, shared  data management, and control of  the systems interface.

ln keeping with new business practices, the Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) procured a commercial off-the-shelf  system to serve as the backbone of  Special Operations Forces telecommunications. The Special Operations Forces Tactical Assured Connectivity System (SOFTACS) will provide deployed ARSOF with secure, seamless, large-bandwidth, satellite transmission, and digital switching services. SOFTACS, purchased  under the tactical satellite terminal program, has achieved economics of  scale by consolidating the requirements of SOF:  the Army, the U.S.  Marine Corps, and  the joint communications support clement.

PERSCOM  began  providing  Video  Teleconferencing Capability (VTC) to customers in October  1996.  Located in the Hoffman Complex in  Alexandria, Virginia,  the  PERSCOM VTC  facility  can  accommodate twenty-five persons.  The  system provides  the  capability for remote instruction and  meetings, significantly reducing temporary duty costs  by $500,000 in its first year of  operation. With VTC, images and sounds in one location arc processed through a coder/decoder and sent through specialized phone lines for digital  transmission  to  another VTC site. Equipment used by  PERSCOM in FY 1997, which  included a fixed  unit with dual 3  J -inch monitors and  a mobile VTC unit, was  not able  to  communicate with  all VTC  sites.  However,  this  situation should  be  alleviated  once  the  global Defense Information System Network is completed in  1998.

The first Joint  Optical Information Network System (JOINS) was fielded to  Army  recruiting stations in  1983, and the second version was delivered in  1988. The latter, based on a computer with a 286 microprocessor and a videodisk capability but no hard drive, became obsolete. It could not  support

new requirements, peripheral devices, or commercial automation software. The vision ofUSAREC under Army Recruiting 2000 was to give a laptop computer to each recruiter. When this plan became DOD's  Joint Recruiting Information Support System (JRISS),  acquisition  of the laptops  became delayed.  USAREC decided on an interim solution, fielding a  multimedia personal computer with a high-speed modem to  1,560 recruiting stations, as  well  as  a  combination fax/copier/printer device  or a  laser printer.  By the  end  of FY  1997,  all  of the  old  software applications on JOINS  had been  replaced and memory chips had been purchased to increase memory from  8  to  24  megabytes.  Recruiter  presentations  have  been  placed  on CD- ROMs  (computer  disk- read  only  memory),  anticipating  the  date when presentations can  be  made  on  laptop  computers.  Communications costs have been reduced owing to  high-speed modems. Recruiter interface software has permitted the recruiter to  enter the first echelon of data into the Army personnel system via the personal computer. In addition, higher headquarters  are  able  to  communicate  more  easily  with  the  recruiting stations  and  provide  cost-effective computer-based  training  courses. The personal computer is bridging the gap from the old JOINS to the multimedia laptop computer that will be provided by ARISS.

The  Total  Army Personnel System (TAPSYS) contract is a requirements contract for automatic data processing services in support of  the Office of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for Personnel (ODCSPER). The first contract was awarded in  1989 to Advanced Technology,  later purchased by Black and Decker, to  provide software development and support for  personnel systems on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis in response to work orders. Jn  1994 the TAPSYS- 2 contract was awarded to Planning Research Corporation, also owned by Black and Decker, for five years and a total of$1 11  million. The new contract permitted both level-of-effort  orders (where requirements were  not well  known and purchases  were  made for a  specified  number of work hours) and completion delivery orders (where requirements were well defined and purchase was made at a guaranteed price). The  TAPSYS2 contract supplied automated services ranging from help-desk operations to supporting the movement offtinctions to a client-server environment. In FY 1997, thirty-four delivery orders were issued,  increasing the value of the contract to $68 million from $25 million at the end of  FY 1996.

To ensure that its operations are adequately and properly documented, as  required  by  law,  the Army  maintains a records  management program. The Army Records Management Program was transferred in 1985 from the Office ofTheAcljutant General to DISC 4 , managed by the new Information Systems Command. The deterioration of the Army Records Management Program, as evidenced by a loss of  documentation during the Gulf  War and demonstrated in an Army redesign study in  1996, convinced the Army to transfer the responsibility for the program from DISC 4 to the deputy chief

of  staff  for personnel, with PERSCOM assuming operational management. The  Information  Systems  Command  reorganized  as  the  Army  Signal Command on  I October 1996 and divested itself  of  all nonsignal missions. The  Army Records Management  Program was subordinate to the US. Army Publications and Printing Command unti I 30 April  J  997, at which time it returned  to  the  responsibility of the Office ofThe Adjutant General.  The new Records Management Program Division was charged with improving the program to meet the Army's  changed requirements, despite a vanished pcrs01mel  infrastructure  resulting from  the  drawdown.  After examining the  Army's  record-keeping  system, the  division planned  to  conduct training  to  ensure that  information is  created  and  preserved  in  garrison and contingency operations, and to develop record-keeping practices user› friendly and independent of  a personnel support infrastructure.

PERSCOM's  Enlisted Personnel Management Directorate was reorganized  from  a  branch concept,  in  which soldiers were  managed  by Military  Occupational  Specialty,  to  a  team  concept,  in  which  soldiers were  managed  withiJ1  geographical  areas.  To  accomplish  the  transition, a  complete revision of several forms and the design of new  forms  were necessary. ln addition, new business practices were incorporated to ensure that items were mailed to soldiers in the field in a timely manner. The new forms and practices reduced the amount of  time and money needed to print and mail materials to soldiers.

To  improve  the  data  quality  of the TAPDB,  the  Army  instituted  the Data Accuracy  Initiative  in  FY  1997. The  project focused  on  increasing timeliness and accuracy in accession data, eliminating grade discrepancies between pay and  personnel,  improving strength  accounting and  reporting to  the ODCSPER, identifying mismatches between the  Unit Identification Code and  the  Personnel Processing Activity,  and  expanding the feedback and  control  mechanisms  for  data  sources.  The  Data  Accuracy  Initiative accomplished theArmy' sgoals in all of  these areas. In addition,aPERSCOM data  accuracy  website  was  established  to  provide  an  up-to-date  and  on› line  venue  for viewing data compatibility and data  discrepancies  between TAPDB, SIDPERS, and the Defense Financing and Accounting Service.

The original Capability Requirement Management  Information System- Redesign (CAPRMIS- R) system, implemented in February 1996, automated the creation, submission, approval, validation, and tracking of requirements  in  the  acquisition  of information  technology.  This  system, PERSCOM's  first attempt  to automate  workflow, enabled technical personnel to made decisions about capability requirements and permitted information  management  officers  to  track  the  status  of  acquisitions. Nevertheless, the Capability Requirement  Management  Information System (CAPRMIS) required too many decisions,  lacked database links, had limited reporting capabilities, and resided on an inadequate hardware

platform.  Under the TAPSYS J I contract, a delivery order was  approved to  redesign  CAPRMIS.  Requirements specifications and  design  began  in November 1996, with CAPRMIS- R software development commencing in April J 997. The redesigned CAPRMlS will be implemented in  November 1997.  With  almost  all  business  rules  automated,  validation  of capability requirements will occur within a 48-bour period.

Under  a  DOD  commitment  to  identify  all information  on  health problems  of Gulf War  veterans,  the  Army  was  assigned  as  the  DOD Executive  Agent to  declassify  pertinent  materials.  Within  the Army,  the Center of Military History's Gulf War  Declassification  Project  (GWDP) assumed this responsibility in April 1995.  On 1 January  1 997 the GWDP transferred to PERSCOM  control.  The  GWDP  provided  oversight  in DOD's effort  to  collect 6.6  million  operational  records and  post 54,700 health-related documents on the Internet. The GWDP collectccl2.3 million documents  in  support of the  Army's effort;  initiated  a  reindcxing  effort to  enable  the  Office  of the  Special Assistant  to  the  Deputy  Secretary of Defense  for  Gulf  War  Illnesses  to  search  the  database  rapidly;  and posted 30,300 documents on the  Internet. By visiting  installations within CONUS and overseas,  GWDP  site  teams  recovered  300,000  additional documents that included 41 logs and journals, 22 situational  reports, and 166  after-action  reviews. The  GWDP also  provided  10,000  documents to operations and  intelligence  officers  to assist them in identifying units'  locations  during  the  war.  The  Association  for  I nformation  and Image  Management  International  recognized  the  GWDP's  information system  with  1 997  Process  Innovation  Awards  for vision  and  innovative soluti ons.  l n  addition,  the  Center  of Military  History  received  a  1997 Computerworld Smithsonian Award  for the GWDP  information system' s innovative usc  of information  technology  to  improve society.  The Army Casualty Information Processing System- G (ACJPS- G) is an operational system  that supports Casualty Area  Commands and  the Army's Casualty and  Memorial  Affairs  Operations  Center.  The system supports  casualty reporting,  the disposition of  remains and  personal effects, and notification and  assistance  to  family  members.  In  1995  DOD  designated  ACIPS- G as  the  new  system  for  casualty  and  mortuary  affairs  processing  for  all services and appointed the Army as its Executive Agent.  During FY  J  997 DOD provided funds to cstabl  ish ACI  PS- G as the foundation  for the new Defense  Casualty  Information  Processing  System  (DClPS),  using  the same contractual support as the Army' s to develop its system. The DCIPS wi II provide  a  standardized,  integrated  casualty  support  system  for  all services to  usc in peace and  war to  manage casualty and mortuary affairs and  will  support joint operations.  Each  military service will  use  uniform procedures, accounting, and casualty reporting under DCIPS, and will be able to  insert  casualty  information from  the field.  Throughout  FY J 997,

the Army worked with all ofthe other military services to determine their specific  functional,  data,  and  technical  requirements  in their  casualty processes. Towards the end of FY  1997, DCIPS development team gave the Casualty Advisory Board the services'  requirements and demonstrated the  Army  Casualty  Information Processing  System  model to  the  board. The DCIPS was extended to the Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps in FY 1997; fielding will be completed in  FY 1999.

The Total Army Equipment Distribution Program (TAEDP) projects the  percentage of Class VIImajor end items of supplyrequirements filled  in a  unit.  But the TAEDP  model, developed  in  the  1970s,  is  slow, inflexible, and obsolete. The  Army  Artificial lnte11 igence Center  is developing the Army Flow Model (AFM), a decision support system that will  integrate  all  HQDA databases  from  Army  master files  and  provide a  tool  for  assessing  force  structure,  personnel,  logistics,  installations, and  budget.  Within  AFM,  the  Logistics Distribution Model  will  replace TAEDP, distributing end items of  equipment along the same rules followed by TAEDP. The Logistics Distribution Model, which meets the real-time analytical  modeling needs of the Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Logistics,  will  also project equipment readiness and calculate secondary item requirements for Army Pre-positioned Stocks.

In another  effort to improve logistics efficiency, changes  were implemented in the Standard Property Book System- Redesign (SPBS- R) to support revisions  in  the  Command Plan  process. The SPBS- R moved to  one revision  per year  to  minimize turbulence and  to  align  the  budget and  documentation  processes.  The  transition  began  in  sunm1er  1996 and  continued  through  the  winter,  producing  MTOE  (Modified  Table of Organization and Equipment)  documents for FY  s L 998 and  1999.  In May  1997  the first  1  2-month documentation cycle began,  during  which FY 2000 MTOE documents were produced. Integration ofTDA (Table of Distribution and Allowances) documents began in November 1996 for FY 1999, creating a flexibility that  permitted changes from the HQDA level and ensuring that  MACOMs would notify HQDA if Command Plan changes resulted  in  TDA  changes. Through  the SPBS- R,  the  new  Logistics- The Army Authorization Document System  would provide a multiyear view of authorization  documents,  an  ability  to  archive  one  document,  and  a capability to produce unit equipment readiness reports based on current or future authorization documents. Property book officers are prevented from editing  req uirements  quantities,  thus  eliminating  discrepancies  between the original  MTOE and the  unit copy.  In addition, property book officers can requisition equipment on the basis oHuture authorizations and can edit on-hand balances as new equipment arrives. The SPBS- R has also reduced discrepancies that occurred because updates of  the Army's primary supply manual and downloads of  the Army Authorization Document System data

were not synchronized, which  resulted in  unit requisitions being rejected because authorizations did not appear in the system.

The  Installation  Status  Report  (ISR)  provides  the  annual  status, based on Army-wide standards, to installation commanders, as well  as to MACOM and DA staffs, of the availability and quality of infrastructure, environmental,  and  service  programs.  The  three  components  of  the ISR  have been  developed and implemented  sequentially. Part !› Infrastructurewas fielded  in  FY  1995  and  reported  the status  of 219 facility types  at 260 Army installations worldwide. In  FY  1997, ARNG consolidated all state- and territory-level reports, reducing the number of installation  reports. Cost estimates were  produced for  maintenance and renovation  of existing facilities,  and  for  constructing  needed facilities. Part II-Environmentwas  initially  fielded  in  FY  1996,  reporting  the status  of 24  environmental  programs  at  1  56  CONUS  and  8  overseas installations.  In FY  1997,  environmental  programs  were  evaluated  for both quality and quantity. As of  the end ofFY 1997, Part IIIServices› had  not  been fielded.  Once compiled, all FY  1997 lSR data was placed in the Headquarters Installation Status Report, a system for viewing ISR data above installation  level,  and  distributed  to HQDA, MACOMS, and MACOM subordinate commands.

The assistant  chief of staff for  installation  management  (ACSJM), with  the  support of the U.S.  Army  Cost and  Economic Analysis  Center, is  developing a measure of base operations called Service Based Costing (SBC),  which  will  assist  in  evaluating  installation  services. Using  a managerial  costing approach,  SBC measures  the full  historical  cost  of providing a standard set of  base support services, identifying the resources consumed. Baseline data were obtained in FY 1994. A field organizational assessment occurred at nine installations in FY 1995, collecting information on  122 services typically  provided  at a  military  installation, which AMC had  identified through a study at twenty-four locations. Prototype efforts were in  place  in  FY  1996, and  the first Army-wide SBC data  collection effort  was  conducted  in  FY  1997. An SBC  team  visited  all  MACOMs and  major  installations  to  brief their  personnel  on  the  data  collection process. Data on  the standard set of 122 services were collected thl'Ough electronic  workbooks  and  transferred  between installations,  MACOMs, and  HQDA via e-mail. By May 1997 information had been collected on all 122  services for seventy-seven installations  and  was  published  in  an Army-wide CD- ROM. Feedback during the collection effort resulted  in a decrease in the number of  services to be considered in the future from  122 to  95. Army  Financial Accounting Codes  have  been redesigned to  align them with the 95 services so that future data collection efforts, beginning with  FY  1999,  can  be  automated.  Information  from  SBC  will  be  used to  develop  the standard expected  cost for a  given  quantity  and  level  of

quality of service  in support of ISR Part IllServices.  Because of SBC, the ACSIM will be able to manage costs by results, in accordance with the Government Pelformance and Results Act, and Army budget requirements and justification will be enhanced.

The Army Audit Agency (AAA) completed a conversion phase for its audit management information system in FY 1997. A successful fielding of the converted system  began  in  the  third quarter of the  fiscal  year and was  completed in the  fourth  quarter.  Software was installed and  training provided at twenty-six AAA  locations.  Once fielding of the system  was complete, some enhancements to the system occurred. One new application eliminated the need for auditors to enter time charges to audits and other projects, permitting auditors to spend more time on the auditing process.

Under the Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiative, the secretary of  the Army directed that all Army software activities develop a Capability Maturity Model certification rating of  Level 3 within six years in an effort to ensure that Army capabilities keep pace with information technology (IT). The Information Support  Activity- St. Louis Software Process Improvement (ISA- St. Louis SPI) program exists to continuously improve the Information Suppot Activity's St. Louis software development capability.  In November 1996, ISA- St. Louis SPI assessed its software process maturity level, with assistance fi·om  the Air Force;  and  in  January  1997  reported  that  it  was at the  initial maturity  level (Level  l).  On the basis of the report,  ISA- St. Louis SPI completed its Software Process Improvement Plan and an Action Plan in February  1997.  A  month  later, the Software Engineering Process Improvement Office was  established,  and,  in April  1997,  a  Management Steering Council was created. By July 1997 training was being conducted on new procedmes that had been developed.

In January 1995 PERSINSD was also assessed at Levell, and, during FY 1997, a Software Engineering Process Group Pilot Project was initiated. In  FY  1997  the  pilot  project  used  SPI  handbooks  to  identify  needed modifications  and  additions,  create  a  Developer  Checklist/Guidelines Handbook for Year 2000 efforts, and establish an automated SPI library on a client-server  platform. At the end ofFY 1997, PERSINSD was finalizing all  SPI-tailorecl  documentation and  began reviewing commercial off-the› shelf  software for possible future purchase.

## Automation Systems

Funding  in  USAREC  is  normally  obtained  at  the  end  of the  year, resulting in piecemeal replacement of  critical technology systems throughout  the year. The  highest  priority user receives the newest equipment, and the  older equipment  is  passed  down  to  a  lower  priority user.  In an  effort to  improve  its office automation, USAREC distributed

six  thousand  personal  computers  during  FY 1997,  the  equivalent  of one per action  officer.  Although  each action  officer  now  had  a  personal computer,  they  were  not totally adequate  nor  could  their capabilities  be expanded. With three different levels of  capabilities among the computers, action officers had trouble exchanging information, as well  as storing and processing it. At the end ofFY 1997, USAREC obtained funds to replace its oldest computer systems in FY 1998, with the exception of  Army Medical Department computers that  will be replaced  by  ARISS  .laptops when the laptops are fielded. In addition, USAREC received funds to replace all laser printers more than · ftve  years old. With  the receipt of  the new computers, all  USAREC action officers will be using the same operating system and software,  enabling  them  to  communicate  more effectively. Future  plans include upgrading or replacing USAREC's  486-microprocessor computers and installing Microsoft Windows 95 and Office 97 on all systems.

Software was also  used to enhance  response  capability  when FORSCOM improved  its  mobilization  system  to  rapidly  activate  reserve  component personnel  and units. FORSCOM  developed  an  automation  initiative, called  mobilization-level  application  software  (MOBLAS),  and  · fielded  it at all  power-projection  and power-support platforms.  MOBLAS provides required  individual and  unit data for mobilization  planning and execution. It integrates reserve  component  personnel  into active-unit databases  and automates soldier-readiness processing associated with mobilization.

fn  addition  to fielding MOBLAS, FORSCOM improved mobilization by  consolidating  responsibilities  for  high-priority  units  at  fifteen  power› projection platforms.  Another twelve  installations,  designated  as  power› support  platforms,  will  perform  the  training  base  expansion  mission, mobilize individuals, and serve as initial mobilization stations for certain enhanced separate brigades of  ARNG.

The Army Recruiting and Accession Data System (Al~DS) collects and processes all  information on every new enlistee in the Total Army and forwards  it to the TAPDB. The ARADS  interfaces electronically with the Military  Entrance Processing Command system for applicant processing information and with the KEYSTONE Recruit Quota System (REQUEST) for  making  trai ning  school  reservations. The  ARADS  also  distributes hundreds of  thousands of  records to the recruiting force and is USAREC's Military Personnel Management System. During FY  1997 the first of  two option periods of  the extended ARADS contract, major modifications were made that will enable ARADS to continue functioning by using new client› server equipment until ARlSS is fully implemented.

The ARADS had been in use for ten years before a new communications infrastructure  was  provided  that  would  support  local  area  networks  for remote sites and provide interfaces through the Internet to DOD and the rest of the world. The Recruiting Services Network (RSN), a private network

with multiple connections to DOD and other private and public networks, provides communications for all oft  he  Total  Army's  recruiting  requirements processed automatically.  In  addition, RSN offers communications ability to  the Total Army and to other military services at a lower cost and with the highest reliability. ln Fiscal Year 1997 the RSN had  13,100 local area network users  on 240  local area  networks at 206 sites, located  in  all  50 states  and  Puerto Rico,  providing critical  support to  the  geographically dispersed  USAREC. Activity  will  increase to  include  more  than  10,000 dial-up users from remote sites.

The SIDPERS- 3, a  new  tool for automating persotmel  actions  and increasing total personnel visibility, passed  its operational assessment in 1996, and operational fielding began in August 1996 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. With the real-time capability of data input and access resident  in  SlDPERS- 3,  personnel  managers  would  be  able  to  obtain timely  information  on soldiers  and better predict  and  meet the Army's and soldiers'  needs. The purpose of  the SIDPERS- 3/TAPDB Interface is to  facilitate  processing of transactions  between  the bottom of the system (SIDPERS- 3), and  the  top  of the  system (TAPDB).  In FY  1997 formal and informal software testing took place, with an interim package installed at Aberdeen in December 1996. Data in  failed  transactions were closely monitored to ensure that SIDPERS- 3 and TAPDB were in synchronization. Fourteen  Engineering  Change  ProposalsSoftware were  created to correct interface problems from the Enlisted Distribution and Assignment System, ARADS, TOPMIS, Accession Management Information System (AMIS), and Inter-Component Data  Transfer (ICDT). Fort Jackson, South Carolina,  was  converted to  SIDPERS- 3  in  May  1997,  and  Fort Drum, New York,  in  September  1997.  In addition, a  new  program  allowed  the Army Training and Requirements System to  report information to  these new SIDPERS- 3 sites during training, saving clerks twenty  minutes per soldier by  not having to  manually enter data  into  the  local database. In spring  1997 a working group met to develop a module that would control all TAPDB- AO updates from all interfacing systems such as SIDPERS- 3, ICDT,  TOPMIS,  and  AMIS.  The  TAPDB  will  support  implementation of the  SIDPERS- 3 system and the fielding  of future  sites,  providing an improved exchange of  data with soldiers in the field.

The KEYSTONE system is an interactive, on-line personnel system supporting  the  Total  Army  and  refers  collectively  to  its  subsystems: REQUEST,  RETAIN,  KMS,  and  KEYVIEW.  The KEYSTONE system provides  critical automated  tools in support  of  accession, training, assignment, retention, reclassification, and mobilization during peace and war. Originally run on a contractor's  mainframe, it is accessible worldwide and  supports  thousands  of users  in  hundreds  of locations.  In  FY  1995 PERSINSCOM acquired  its  own mainframe, on  which the KEYSTONE

system was operating solely by December 1995. This mainframe was aging when purchased, however, and by the end of  FY  1997 was not meeting the needs of  the personnel community.

The KEYSTONE RETAIN is an interactive, automated system designed to  supportODCSPER in providing personnel  to the active  Army during peace and war.  KEYSTONE RETAIN supports retention by providing real-time policy  updates  to  personnel  managers worldwide,  ensuring  that  the  most highly qualified  persotUlel in each field  are targeted for retention.  A copy of  the Persormel Enlisted Data Base is received by  KEYSTONE RETAIN, which  provides the  retention  noncommissioned officer at each  unit a  tist of  personnel eligible for retention and their fields of  eligibility. During FY 1997 KEYSTONE RETAfN was expanded to include the same information and  capability for  USAR and ARNG. In addition, KEYSTONE RETAIN helps to identify individuals who transfer to the reserve components and to assist in processing reclassification actions.

To find ARNG vacancies  for  soldiers who  left the active Army with service commitments, without relying on a recruiter or  counselor to contact a  unit  or  state  by  telephone,  ARNG  fielded  the  Army  National  Guard Automated Unit Vacancy System during FYs 1995 and  1996. States sent weekly lists of vacancies to the National  Guard  Bureau, which posted a consolidated list on KEYSTONE RETAIN that users could access around the world.  As of  7  October  1996,  fourteen  statesArkansas, California, Florida,  Indiana,  Maine,  Nebraska,  North  Dakota,  Ohio,  Oklahoma, Oregon,  Pennsylvania,  South  Carolina, Utah,  and Washingtonand  the territory of  Puerto Rico were able to post their vacancies on KEYSTONE RETAIN. Vacancies in  the remaining states and territories will be posted on-line during FY  1998.

PERSCOM's OPMD took numerous automation initiatives during FY 1997, primarily in the areas of  functional proponency for the TAPDB- AO, TOPMIS, and local area networks. While reengineering of  the mainframe› based TOPMlS to a client-server environment continued, requirements for the TOPMlS assignment and requisition functions were being developed. A new TOPMlS 11 Command Slate Briefing System was developed in time to support the FY 1997 command slate briefing to the chief of  staff of the Army. Other new developments in TOPMIS included colonels'  assignment and neld interview worksheets and an on-line Officer Record Brief. A Data Accuracy Cell  was created to  manage officer data  accuracy issues  raised by  the ODCSPER Data Accuracy Task Force, and  an OPMD Automation Master Plan was published. Capabilities were added to the OPMD branching model  to  distribute  officers  of high  quality  equally  tlu·oughout  Army branches and to  determine the branch  mix  for Reserve Officers Training Corps cadets. OPMD also began a process of  placing all historical files and records onto CD- ROMs for easy retrieval in the future.

To modernize  automation  at  CCF, a project began in 1996 to change  the Clearance Management System to an  open-system  operating environment.  PERSCOM funded  lour unfinanced requirements that  CCF had  identified  to  support  thi s  process: software  development,  $150,000; workstation upgrade, $680,000; telecommunications infrastructwe upgrade,  $600,000;  and  software  and  hardware  maintenance,  $65,000. The upgrades for workstations and  the telecommunications infrastructure were necessary for CCF to  be compatible with new Defense Lnvcstigative Service automation.

During FY  1994 the security clearance application for the Sustaining Base Information Services Program dropped the remote access status check function  from  its development plan. The  commander of  CCF decided  to develop  that capability  from  internal  resources  in  FY  1 995.  Developed from  a  shareware  program,  the  Security  Office  Interface  (SOl)  allows security  managers  worldwide  to  check  the  status  of security clearances and clearance actions  in  CCF via dial-in access  to  CCF's local database. The SOl  was ready for dissemination by October 1996.  In  FY  I  997 CCF distributed  SOl  sof tware  to  204  security  managers,  with I  06  of them establishing connectivity to CCF throughout the fiscal  year.

The  operating  systems  that  processed  Army  personnel  information in  the Army Reserve  Personnel Command  (ARPERSCOM) and  ARNG were  not  Y2K  compliant  in 1997.  The  Personnel  Enterprise  System› Automation (PES-A)  office, which is responsible for in tegrating hardware  platforms and operating systems across the Total  Army, negotiated  with  IBM (International Business  Machines  Corporation)  to acquire  an  upgraded  operating  system  for  ARPERSCOM  and  ARNG. They  added  the  upgraded  system  to  an  existing  PES- A  contract  for automation  replacement.  Although  there  was  no  significant  additional cost to ARPERSCOM or ARNG, the new  operating system  will  be  the base of  the infrastructure that will  provide Y2K compliance. In  addition, this upgrade ofthe ARPERSCOM  and ARNG systems saved more than 25  percent in  maintenance costs.

One of  the Army's highest priorities is logistics automation, an essential clement  in  providing efficient  and  effective  force sustainment  to  soldiers. Besides enabling logistics efficiencies, logistics automation provides benefits for soldiers.  By digitizing selected  technical manuals,  the Army eliminated the  need to  carry 200 pounds of M  I  AI Abrams tank  manuals to  the field. These  electronic  technical  manuals  contain  information  on  a  variety  of combat, wheeled, and aviation systems. Distribution of these new manuals continued during FY  1997. lntcractivc electronic technical manuals, which add a prognostic and diagnostic capability, will soon be available.

I  mplcmentation of  the Standard Army Retai I  Supply System- Objective (SARSS- 0) continued during FY  1997 and will be completed in  FY  1998.

This multilevel supply management and stock control system will automate the  management of supply  and  will  be  the  single  retail  supply  system throughout the Total Army. The SARSS- 0  provides faster requisition and status flow,  gives greater asset visibility,  reduces excess, performs lateral redistribution, and allows split operations. ln another logistics automation development, USAR created an engineer management automation system, which provides the entire USAR's  engineer community with an automated method  for  managing their respective  faci lity and real estate  inventories from conception through disposal.

Over the years, installations and  MACOMs have developed a number of automated Central Issue Facility (CIF) systems. The Army recognized that to  improve management ofClFs, it needed to develop a standardized Army-wide automation system. A  CIF  module was  developed  that will provide a  user-friendly  system  for  the  receipt,  storage,  issue, exchange, and turn-in of  authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment at  Army installations. Initial fielding of  the module began in May 1997, but significant problems developed at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and  the module was returned to development to resolve them. At the end of  FY 1997, the CIF module was being tested at Fort Polk, Louisiana; Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Hunter Army  Airfield,  Georgia;  and  Fort  Stewart  Georgia.  Fielding  to additional  locations  is  expected  to  resume in  FY  1998,  after the  module problems have been corrected.

ln 1993 the  deputy  secretary of  defense, seekingtoeliminateduplication in  information systems, directed that DOD accelerate its selection of  new systems,  setting  of data  standards,  and  improvement  of processes.  The Joint Transportation Corporate Information Management Center (JTCC), part of the  U.S.  Transportation  Command,  was  given  the  responsibility of managing  the  upgrade  of DOD  transportation  systems.  The  Joint Transportation  Coordinator's  Automated Information for Movements System II  (TCAIMSII) was selected as the automation system to  replace currentscrvice  Installation  Transportation  Officeffransportation Movement Office and unit movement systems. JTCC drew parts ofTCAlMSil from each of  the military services. The Army, as the lead agent for the upgrade to TCAIMSIT, established the Joint Program Management Office (JPMO), which as of September 1997 was staffed primarily by Army civilians and active Army officers. In  October 1996 the  Army established the Deployment Process Modernization Office at the U.S. Army Transportation School  at Fort  Eustis, Virginia,  to  act  as  the Army's clearinghouse  for TCAIMSII requirements.  Seven  working-level  integrated product  teams  assisted  in program development in specific areas and produced several documents on TCAlMSII requirements that were approved in August 1997. Each service selected two locations where sofiware would  be tested.  In  January  1997 the Army chose Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Eustis. Site surveys, equipment

installation, and training  were  accomplished during the rest of the  fiscal year, with testing commencing in September 1997 and scheduled to end in February 1998. The JPMO released two versions ofTCAIMSll during FY 1997, but they were very difficult to work with as they still reflected their Air Force and Marine Corps origins too closely.

After using electronic commerce (EC)  technologies  for years,  DOD began  the  Electronic  Commerce  Program  in  1988,  requesting  that  all services and agencies make maximum use of  Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  ln  1990  DOD  required  the  implementation  of EDJ  in  logistics, contracting, and finance activities.  DOD published an  EC/EDl Strategic Plan in  1991 , and directed in 1993 that an EC infrastructure be developed. Although  numerous  Army  EC/EDI  initiatives  have  occurred  over  the years, the efforts have been uncoordinated and require a cohesive strategy. In L997  DISC 4 initiated  a  strategic  plan  for  implementing  EC,  using  a business planning methodology that was consensus driven, team oriented, and  focused  on  business processes  rather than  technologies.  Following a  series  of structured  interviews  by  DISC 4 personnel  of individuals  in principal Army  agencies,  the  EC  mission  and  guiding  principles  were developed; the EC vision for the Army was established; an analysis of the Army's current use of EC was conducted; and future goals and strategies were adopted. The strategic plan  includes  an  emphasis  on  national and international standards, business  practices, commercial off-the-shelf products,  and  security  issues.  In  addition,  the  plan  supports  the  C''/IT Strategic  Plan  and  the  JTA- A.  Electronic  commerce  technologies  will assist  the  Army  in  reducing  overhead  and  streamlining  operations  to achieve maximum cost efficiencies.

Although technology has  received a  higher priority  in  today's Army, the  PERSCOM Data Processing  Installation  (DPI)  was deteriorating. It was unable  to  provide  enhanced  computer capabilities,  and the  current operation  systems running on D  PI platforms  were  experiencing  degradation, resulting  in  poor  response times  to  users.  A  new IBM 9021  mainframe computer would solve the problem, but the purchase price of$9.2 million was prohibitively expensive. Towards the end ofFY 1996, an excess lBM 9021,  with  the  same  processing power  as  a  new  system  and  a  transfer cost of $577,240, was located at the Social Security Administration. The Army and the Social Security Administration  signed a  memorandum of agreement in December 1996 and February  1997, respectively. The IBM 9021  was delivered to the DPI in Alexandria, Virginia, in March 1997 and was operational two  months  later. The new  system doubles DPI's earlier capacity and will be able to expand to meet growing requirements.

The MIL.80X II contract, the primary acquisition vehicle for hardware, software, communications, and support services for the Army personnel community,  was  scheduled to  expire  in  February  1997.  Continuing  the

contract  was  essential  for  the personnel  community's  IT  programs. PERSCOM allocated $7 million  for the development and processing of procurement documentation  to  acquire a  new contract.  While searching for alternative replacement vehicles, PES- A personnel attempted to renew the  MIL 80X IT  contract. Acquisition reforms enacted  by  Congress and implemented by DOD permitted the 80X to be replaced using simplified acquisition  strategies  and  fewer  bureaucratic  procedures,  saving  the  $7 million. In addition, PES- A saved an additional $491,887 in hardwm· e and software maintenance and contractor support costs, and achieved a one› time cost avoidance of$ 15,230,736 in hardware and software acquisitions. Most significantly, the innovative acquisition strategies resulted in saving $40,700,000 over the life cycle of  the contract. The original life cycle cost had  been estimated to  be $384 million for 9.5 years,  but was  reduced  to $343.3 for 15.5 years.

## Budget

## Economies and Efficiencies

The  National  Performance  Review  (NPR),  begun  in  March  1993, was  in  its  fourth  year  of operation  in  fisca l year  (FY)  1 997. Creating a more effective, efficient,  and  productive federal  government while  using fewer  resources  was  the  goal sought  by  the NPR.  Recognir.ing  the need to reinvent  its  business  practices,  the  Department  of Defense  (DOD) designated certain organizations in which experimentation could take place without the burden of  bureaucratic red tape. Forty reinvention laboratories and four  reinvention centers, as these organizations  were called,  were in existence in  the Army during FY  1997. Commanders of  these reinvention laboratories  and  centers  possessed  authority  to  waive  regulations  and coordinate  directly  with  DOD  to  recommend  future  legislative  changes that  supported  reinvention.  In  August  1994  the  secretary  of the  Army established  a  new  policy  waiving Army  regulations  that  hindered  good business practices, providing commanders of these organizations with an important tool. At the end of  FY 1 997, the Army had approved 286 requests for waivers,  of  which reinvention  laboratories and centers submitted  222 requests;  other Army organizations submitted the remainder.  In addition, the Army  established  a Recngincering Legislative Working Group under the vice chief  of  staff  of  the Army and  the assistant secretary of  the Army for  manpower  and  reserve  affairs  to  review  all  Army  reinvention  and recnginccring  legislative  initiatives  and  to  develop  a  strategy  for  their approval  by  Congress.  This  development  has  streamlined  the  Army's acquisition process  and  expedited  the  enactment of legislative changes. During  1997 nineteen Army organizations won the Hammer Award, given by the vice president to organizations that significantly supported the NPR. Through 1997, nearly 25 percent of  all Hammer Awards had been given to Army organizations.

The  fiscal  environment  within  which  DOD  and,  consequently,  the Army operated in FY 1997 necessitated new ways of  conducting missions, as resources continued to be constrained. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)  projected  that  annual  defense  budgets  would  remain  at  about

$250  billion  beyond  FY  1997  and  deemed the  prospect of larger sums being appropriated as  unlikely.  ln  addition,  the  QDR  recognized  that  as federa l expenditures decreased, DOD  would  probably  have to  shoulder a proportionate share of  those declining resources. Although DOD has been able  to  maintain  the  force  structure  recommended  by  the  1 993  Bottom› Up  Review and  the 1995  Bottom-Up Review Update, the budget has not provided sufficient funding for modernization or procurement.  Following the  end  of the  Cold  War, the  drawdown  enabled  DOD  to eliminate  old equipment  from  its  inventory,  leaving  the  military  with  modern  1980s equipment. As a result, the  DOD procurement budget stabilized at about $40 billion  in the early and  mid- 1 990s.

In the  late  1990s,  however,  equipment  modernization  has  become critical, and adequate  funds remain unavailable.  To maintain forces and  military  readiness,  DOD  has  placed  the  highest funding  priority  on sustaining troops and ensuring that the United States retains technological superiority  in  the  future. Procurement  funding  had  been  expected  to grow  as  a  result  of cost-reduction  initiatives  in  other  areas,  but  these savings  were  less  than  anticipated.  Other unprogrammed  expenses, such as  contingency  operations and  higher costs  for  depot  and  real property maintenance,  further diminished  available  funds  and  resulted  in  annual postponements of modernization goals. The FY 1998  President's Budget and  the six-year Future Years Defense Program submitted to Congress in FY 1997 projected a steep rise in  procurement funding from $42.6 billion in  the FY  1998 budget to $60 billion  in  FY 2001. After analysis of  recent trends, however, the QDR concluded that future unplanned expenses of  as much as $ 1 0- 12  billion  per year would  undermine  that growth.  Savings from  reduced  infrastructure costs and  transition of  some  major programs from development  to  production  would  provide  an  offset,  permitting procurement funding to increase, but that funding would level ofT at about $50 billion per year.

Finding  ways  to  cut  costs  has  become  critical  in the  Army. The Army Resources  Board approved  a concept in  FY  1996  for  conducting oversight of  the FY s 1998- 2003 Program Objective Memorandum (POM) efficiencies effort. This effort would eliminate duplicate functions, consolidate organizations, simplify procedures, improve professionalism, and increase efficiency throughout the Army. ln the FY  s 1998- 2003 POM, the Army introduced a number of  initiatives to support the reprogramming of  $2. 1  bi llion  to  meet high priority programs. The new oversight process approved  by the Army  Resources  Board  defined  the  efficiencies  by category.  Category  I efficiencies were identified as  those that had already been  implemented  in  the  POM  and  required  no further action.  Category 11  efficiencies were identified as those that required implementation plans and  consistent  monitoring. As  of December  1996,  there  were  fourteen

Category  I  efficiencies,  which  could  save  the  Army  $1.69  billion,  and forty Category II efficiencies, which  could save $7.09 billion. The Army Audit Agency (AAA) was directed to review and evaluate the Category li implementation plans and, by the end ofFY 1997, had done so for twenty› four of  the forty efficiencies, issuing eight reports. The audits showed that for  eight  efficiencies  with  an  estimated  $2.06  billion  in  savings,  nearly $784 million in estimates were unsupported.

Of  the  twenty-four  efficiencies  that  AAA  reviewed,  the Office  of the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics (ODCSLOG)  estimated  it would  save  $412.5  million  employing  four  efficiencies:  depot-level repairable return rates, Integrated Logistics Analysis Program, Standard Army  Retail  Supply  System- Objective,  and  velocity management. The  Army  Materiel  Command  (AMC)  estimated  it  could  implement seven efficienciesadministrative/production lead-time, electronic contracting, training resource model credit policy, cost of  spares, closure of  the  European  Redistribution  facility,  operating  and  support  cost reductions,  and  integrated  sustainment maintenanceand  save  $ l  .625 billion.  Within  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Operations and  Plans,  four  efficiencies estimated  to  save $215.4  million  involved an  "offset  to  training  modernization"  (a  reduction  in  the  number  of projected  students,  and  therefore  projected  costs,  based  on  historical experience); reduction of paid parachutist authorizations; greater use of training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations; and power projection platforms  (elimination of the  mobilization mission, and therefore some civilian  positions,  at  eleven  installations).  The  Offtce  of the  Deputy Chief of  Staff for  Personnel calculated  it would  save $ 1.4  billion  with four efficiencies that encompassed permanent change-of-station  (PCS) reductions,  changes  in  the  noncommissioned  officer  structure,  filling specialist  positions I 00  percent,  and  reducing  attrition. An efficiency to  reduce  leases  was  estimated  by  the  Office  of  the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Installation  Management  (OACSJM)  to  save  $309.3  million. Finally, The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and  Comptroller expected to save  $ 168  million  with  the efficiency in debt avoidance.

In FY  1996  and  early  FY  1997  the  service  developed  the  Army Strategic Management Plan  (SMP) to provide a means through which the chief  of  staff  of  the Army (CSA) and other senior leaders in Headquarters, Department  of the  Army  (HQDA),  could  exercise  quarterly  review of selected  performance  initiatives  and  planned  economies  important  to realizing Army Vision 2010. In January 1997 the vice chief  of  staff held an in-progress review for principal members of  the Army secretariat to  brief them on the plan's  current status, elicit their ideas, and lay out an approach for continuing the plan as a collaborative effort with the secretariat.  Plan

administrators subsequently sought  to  strengthen  the  plan  and  make  the task  of tracking  more  than  three  hundred  managerial  initiatives  more manageable by setting an SMP goal of  Stewardship. Among other changes, the improved plan made it clear that the POM would drive SM P objectives, not  the  reverse. In other  words,  the  SMP  was  not the  place  to  introduce unfounded requirements.

In  one  of its  many  efforts  to  conserve  resources,  change  traditional operating methods, and institute good business practices, the Army utilized Javits- Wagner--O'Day  (JWOD) resources to a greater  extent than previously. The  Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act  of 1971 requires  government  agencies  to purchase selected products and services from nonprofit agencies that employ blind or  severely disabled personnel and have demonstrated their capability to produce quality goods and services at reasonable prices.  The Committee for Purchase . From People Who Arc Blind or Severely Disabled administers the .JWOD program; and two national, independent organizationsthe National Industry for the Blind and the National Industry for the Severely Disabled› assist state and private nonprofit agencies  in  participating  in  the  program. Benefits  to  the  government  include  high-quality supplies and  service,  on› time delivery,  reasonable prices, reduction  of paperwork and costs, central points  of contact  to  resolve  problems,  reduced  disability  payments,  and increased tax  revenues. By creating a mandatory supply source, the JWOD program has been successful  in  creating jobs and training opportunities for its clientele, allowing them  to  lead  more productive and  independent  lives by ofTering them a stable work experience, increased income, marketable job :;ki lls,  and  a possible future  outside of  the nonprofit agency.  When serious supply problems resulted from the closure of  self-service supply centers, the backbone of local supply, on Army installations, the Army turned to JWOD. Entering into agreements with the  National  Industry  for  the  Blind and  the National  Industry for the Severely Disabled, the Army gained supply stores on  military installations at little or no cost to the government.

To improve the procurement process while developing a technologically superior force quickly and with fewer available resources, the Army created in November I 995 an  Acquisition Reform (AR) Plan that consisted ofthirty initiatives in six major areas: requirements and budget, overhead reduction, barrier  reduction,  testing  and  evaluation,  production  and  fielding,  and sustainment. As the vehicle for executing the Acquisition Reform Plan, the assistant secretary ofthe Army for research, development, and acquisition (AS/\  [RD&amp;A])  developed  and disseminated the Army  Acquisition Reform  Strategy  in  August 1996. The  Acquisition  Reform Strategy emphasized partnership and customer support over the traditional methods of regulations and statistics and would empower persom1el  to  continually improve  acquisition  processes.  Recognizing  that  implementation  at  the lowest levels  was  essential, the AS/\ (RD&amp;A) provided  the "Guidelines

for Army Acquisition Reform Strategic Planning" in  September J 996 to every Army acquisition organization.

Each  organization  was  directed  to incorporate  the new  strategy into  its  strategic  planning  process  and  to  produce  an AR  improvement plan  specifically  designed  around  its mission  and  customer  support. Furthermore, each organization was charged with establishing an AR  home  page  on  the  Tnternet  by November  1996  and  posting  its improvement plan on  the  home page by  15  March  1 997. Ofthe thirteen major commands (MACOM) and  nine program executive officers (PEO) required to post improvement plans on home pages, 68 percent had done so  by 28 J  uJy  1997, when ASA (RD&amp;A) assessed  implementation of the AR strategy. The Forces Command (FORSCOM) was commended for its AR improvement plan institutionalizing a strategic planning system that consisted of a strategic plan, an  annual assessment, an annual plan,  and quarterly  reviews.  In  addition,  ASA  (RD&amp;A)  commended  the office  of the  PEO,  Intelligence,  Electronic Warfare,  and  Surveillance,  for  its  use of metrics to assess progress; the office of the PEO, Tactical Missiles, for its inclusion of  AR accomplishments; the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command for its progress reports and lessons learned; AMC for its innovative approach and self-assessment; and the office of  the PEO, Air and Missile Defense, for its thorough implementation of  the AR strategy.

In  an  effort  to  enhance  acquisition  reform, the Army established  the Warfighting  Rapid  Acquisition  Program  (WRAP)  in  April  1996.  This program  was  intended  to  accelerate  the  fielding  of new  systems  and technologies identified through advanced warfighting experiments (AWE), advanced technology demonstrations, advanced concept technology demonstrations, and similar demonstrations and evaluations conducted by the Training and Doctr.ine Command  (TRADOC). Following the AWE  in March  1997, WRAP identified critical new systems and technologies that may  be essential for fielding the first  Army  XXI Division  by  September 2000. Because these newly identified systems and technologies had not yet been funded, TRADOC was authorized to appoint a WRAP Army Systems Acquisition Review Council  to  review each unfunded "new start" and set priorities for those that required urgent funding.

To improve further the acquisition process, the secretary of the Army designated  the  Army  XXI Acquisition  Reform Reinvention  Laboratory as  a virtual laboratory  in September  1996.  Unlike  other  reinvention laboratories and centers, the Acquisition Reform Reinvention Laboratory is  not  an  organization  but  a  process.  Under  the  aegis  of the  NPR,  the reinvention  laboratory  integrates, controls, and  improves  the acquisition processes  of all Army  organizations  engaged  in  materiel  acquisition. The Acquisition  Reform  Reinvention  Laboratory  achieved  considerable progress in FY 1997 in  reforming the acquisition process. For example, an

integrated product team reduced the time required for acquiring changes for  tactical  automated  systems,  previously  two  to  five  years, to  a  much shorter period of  two to six months, thereby validating the new concepts and new processes.

Many  new  or  ongoing  initiatives  to improve  business  practices emphasized the Army's resolve to minimize the effects of  fewer available resources. FORSCOM reorganized its staff  to  focus on  core  competencies of training, mobilization, deployment, sustainment, installation management, and  quality of life. To  establish clear and  measurable command goals to realize these core competencies, FORSCOM developed a strategic business plan  that  identified  nine  strategic  performance  indicators  and  eighteen measures of  effectiveness. AMC began work to develop revised  business processes  to  achieve  a  single stock fund  that would  modernize how  the Army manages secondary items (end items, replacement assemblies, parts, and consumables). The command established a Corporate Board to manage and guide implementation of  a single stock fund. In June, however, HQDA halted work on the single stock fund concept until a reexamination of  the concept and management structure could be completed.

Senior Army leaders have strongly endorsed initiatives to  privatize or contract needed functions, particularly with respect to business practices or  noncore  competencies,  and  to  attract  private  capital  to  renovate  the aging i11fi"astructure.  As  privatization  became an  increasingly  important tool  in  saving defense dollars, the deputy secretary of  defense formed an Integrated Policy Team for Outsourcing and Privatization in October 1995 to implement  outsourcing  initiatives.  In  response,  the Army's assistant chief  of  staff  for installation management established the Outsourcing and Privatization Office in February 1997. Two months later, the Army briefed its  entire  outsourcing  and  privatization  program to  the  DOD  integrated policy  team. At  that  time,  the  Army  committed  itself to  studying  fifty thousand  personnel  positions  with  an  eye towards  determining whether service  members  and  Department  of  the  Army  civilians  or  contract personnel should fill them. In addition, the Resource  Analysis and  Business Practices  Office,  OASA  (FM&amp;C),  actively  worked  to  identify  potential Army  outsourcing  and  privatization  candidates,  as  well  as  to  propose legislative  changes  to  remove  restrictions  hindering  wider  access  to  the private sector when these rules  were inconsistent with good government and managerial principles.

The Commercial Activities Program was another means employed to study Army practices. A methodical review of  base operations functions at all installations enabled the Army to determine that it would be more cost› effective  to provide some  of those services  through  contracted  support. The Army privatized some of its functions  and  leased some facilities  to local  governments.  In  addition,  wmeeded  facilities  were  turned  over  to

new,  more productive uses or were  preserved  for future use.  In  a  related program,  DOD generated  revenue  for  base  operations  through  its  Sale and  Outlease  Program.  Underutili:.ccd  real  and  personal  properly  was leased  to  the  private  sector.  By  law,  the  funds  generated  remained  with the  installation  owning the  property.  The Army  earned  $20  million and additional  in-kind  benefits  during  the  fiscal  year.  Through  partnerships with  local governments, universities, and  businesses, the Army obtained needed  services  in exchange  for Army  assets or services.  For example, local governments  and  private  businesses  that  provided  maintenance, lighting,  and  fencing at Army airfields  were allowed  to  usc  the  facility, while universities provided computers in exchange for space.

Searching for  ways  to  do  more  with  less,  the Army  also adopted  a commercial  practice  called  Asset  Management  Strategy. Under  this program, the Army obtained private sector financing to  build or improve some  of its  vast  real-property  assets,  which  it  then  shared  with  the lender. Possession  of real-property  assets  enabled  the  Army  to  engage in  innumerable collaborative projects with  the  private  sector.  Under  the Capital Venture Initiative, contractors owned and operated family housing for Army  members, allowing the Army to shorten the time necessary to acquire such  housing by many years.  In  the best example,  Fort Carson, Colorado,  handed  over  management  of its  Army  Family  Housing  to  a private enterprise.  In  exchange,  the  private company  used  its  capital  to manage the installation housing, revitalize deteriorated housing, and, most important, construct 840 sorely  needed  new  housing units that the Army had not been able to build for years owing to a lack of  funds.

With  prime  vendor contracting,  the Army  was  able  to  reduce  costs by maintaining a  minimal level of  stockage. Under this concept, a single supplier was permitted to distribute a specific class of  commercial supplies within  a  specified  geographical  area.  Orders  were  placed  electronically and the prime vendor provided "just-in-time delivery" to meet the Army's requirements.  At  Fort  Sam I  Iouston,  Texas, the  U.S.  Army  Medical Command successfully used prime vendor contracting to obtain improved delivery of  quality medical services with an increase in savings.

As early as 1993, the General Accounting Office (GAO) indicated that DOD could save resources by following commercial practices in ordering and  receiving  subsistence  (food  supplies).  That  same  year,  the  deputy secretary  of defense  for  logistics  established  a  demonstration  project, involving the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), to evaluate the use of  private sector practices to reduce the cost of  DOD food inventories.  Conducted in FY  1995, the demonstration project compared costs and benefits ofusing  commercial food distributors for DOD activities in  Alabama,  Florida,  Georgia,  and  South  Carolina.  Army  installations afJccted  by  this  project  included  Redstone Arsenal  and  Forts  McClellan

and Rucker in Alabama; Camp Blanding, Florida; Forts Benning, Gillem, Gordon, and Stewart in  Georgia; and Fort Jackson, South Carolina. DOD learned  that  food  could  be  delivered  to  defense  dining  facilities  three times  each  week efficiently  and  effectively  by  commercial  vendors  and with  a  quality  of service  that  equaled  or exceeded  that of DOD's own depot subsistence activity. As a result, a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for  FY  1996  required  the  use  of prime  vendors  for subsistence.  This  measure  was  expected  to  reduce  defense  subsistence inventories  as  well  as  decrease the  number of personnel  necessary  for warehouse inventory maintenance. Prime vendor solicitation and contract award was accomplished by the Defense Support Center, Philadelphia, a DLA activity. In September 1997 prime vendor subsistence contracts were implemented at all active Army installations within the continental United States (CONUS) and will begin overseas in February 1998.

Some military functions, however, cannot be outsourced or privatized. The United  States Code prohibits contracting for fire:fighting  or security guard functions except when  occurring overseas, on government installations operated by private organizations, on a  contract that  began before September  1983,  or on  a  base scheduled for  closing  within  180 days.  Because outsourcing of  these functions  is prohibited  in  most cases, a  recent  GAO  report  could  not  determine  whether  contracting  for  the services  would  be  more cost-effective. Although  the  GAO did  note  that savings usually result from such a practice, it found  mixed  results  in  the tew cases where Jirefighting services had been contracted. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Congress required DOD to provide by 31  December 1997 a plan that will identify firefighting and security guard functions that must remain under government control and how  to  outsource these functions  if the  law  is  repealed.  About twenty› five  hundred  Army fire:fighting  personnel  positions  would  be subject to outsourcing. The Army will host a meeting of  defense and military agencies in  November 1997 to draft the plan.

Controversy surrounds at lea$t one  of  the  Army's  efforts at  privatization. Tank gun mounts for the Ml A  1 Abrams tank have been produced in equal numbers at the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and the Detroit Army Tank Plant (under the auspices of  General Dynamics) in Michigan since  1983. When tank and armored vehicle production declined in the 1990s, the Army considered whether to consolidate the  manufacturing jobs at the Detroit Army  Tank  Plant,  privatizing  the  operation  under  General  Dynamics. Some savings  would  be realized  but Rock lsland Arsenal would not be closed, resulting  in  residual overhead costs. Under the Base Realignment and Closure 95,  however, the Army closed the Detroit Army Tank Plant, and the ASA (RD&amp;A) directed a cost-effectiveness study in  March  1996 to  determine whether the gun  mount production  at Rock  Island  Arsenal

should be privatized.  The American Federation of  Government Employees, which  represented the Rock  Island Arsenal  employees, filed  a  lawsuit  in March  1997  to  prevent  movement  of the  manufacturing jobs  to  Detroit. Politicians  in Tllino.is  and Michigan  supported  their  respective  state's facility, and  the Army decided  not to change its operation at that time.

Because the gun mounts were component parts of a weapons system produced  by  a  prime  contractor,  the  general  counsel,  DOD,  ruled  in March  1997 that the Army was not required to  use techniques prescribed by  the Office  of Management and  Budget (OMB) to  ascertain  the cost› cfTcctivcncss of components  produced  in  a government  arsenal.  Rather, the  general counsel stated  that  a  cost comparison should  be  conducted using procedures outlined under the Arsenal Act. The Arsenal Act, which was  enacted  in  1920,  mandated  that  the  Army  obtain  its  military  guns and  warfighting equipment from  U.S.  factories or arsenals, provided  this production could be accomplished economically. Rock Island Arsenal and Watervliet Arsenal, in New York, were the  two remaining Army arsenals that  had  been  manufacturing  weapons  since  the  early  1 800s.  Since  the end  of the  Cold  War,  as  workloads  and  employment  declined  at  both arsenals,  operating costs  increased  as  fixed  costs  were  borne  by  smaller levels of production.  Following  OSD's recommendation, ASA  (RD&amp;A) immediately directed  that AMC conduct a cost-comparison study  under the provisions of  the Arsenal Act; the study is nearly completed.

The  Army  is  also  working  to  improve  its  contracting  process  by replacing  the  Standard  Army  Automated  Contracting  System  and  the ProcurcmentAutomated Data Documentation System with DOD's  Standard Procurement  System. A  coordinated  system,  the  Standard  Procurement System combines several acquisition functions, standardizes the process, and  creates an acquisition environment  more completely integrated. The Corps of Engineers Financial Management System and  the  Procurement Tracking System feed  the  Standard  Procurement System  information to the  Defense  Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS),  warehouses, and other logistics systems. After all  requirements are entered into the system, resource  management  personnel  fund  the  electronic  purchase  requests, which  arc  then  sent  directly  to  the  Standard  Procurement  System  for acquisition.  This  process  eliminates  the  need  for  contracting  personnel to  enter  fund  sites,  avoiding  incorrect  inputs  that would  delay  payment. Because  the  resulting  contract  is  forwarded  to  the  vendor  as  an  e-mail attachment, distribution to all parties  is cheaper, faster, and simultaneous. In  preparation  for fielding  the  system  in  FY  1998, each Army  MACOM is currently  upgrading  existing  hardware  to  ensure  it  will meet  the infrastructure requirements.

In yet another  measure designed  to  reduce  contracting costs,  DOD established  the Single Process  Initiative  in  December  1 995.  In  contractor

facilities, different  contractual  requirements  often  resulted  in  varying processes or  specifications demanded in the manufacturing or management of  similar goods and services. Through this inherently inefficient process, both the contractor and  the federal government incurred additional costs and greater workloads. DOD decided to eliminate these multiple processes, specifications, and contracts  in  favor  of a  common  set of processes and performance  specifi. cations  on  existing contracts.  Such a  change  would produce savings for the contractor and  the government,  but  not until  all contracts at a given facility had been modified. Rather  than modify contracts singly, DOD opted to  provide a "block change" of all contracts within a given facility. At each facility, the Administrative Contracting Officer was designated as the single point of contact for  facilitating  the  process.  In addition  to  streamlining the process, this avoided unnecessary paperwork and costly proposals on the part of  the contractor. At the same time, DOD requested that contractors provide concept papers with  proposals on how the Single Process Initiative should be implemented. Of  the 622 acquisition process changes that contractors proposed, the Army accepted 350 and is still  considering 181; the contractors withdrew the remainder following a technical review.  General  Electric Aircraft Engines submitted  the  largest number of  concept papers, with 22 accepted and 12 under negotiation. At the end of  FY 1997, the Army was conducting contract modifications with 55 contractors, of  whom 35 were among DOD's top 200 contractors.

Recapitalization also provided an avenue whereby the Army could reduce  operating costs.  With  this  process,  worn  or  dated  equipment was  replaced  or  refitted  so  that  it  remained  operationally  safe,  was reliable in wartime, cost less time and money to  maintain, and gained an extended  useful  life.  Although  many  Army  systems are currently under  production  or  being  fielded,  aging  equipment  has  become  a chronic  problem.  When funds  must be  spent to  maintain  old fleets  of equipment,  readiness  and  procurement objectives  suffer.  In  addition to replacement, the  Army  achieves recapitalization via extended service  programs,  preplanned  product  improvements,  depot  rebuild, and  technology  insertions.  During  FY  1997,  the Arm.y  set a  goal  to recapitalize 75 percent of its equipment by 2012.

TJu·ough  streamlined operations resulting from the Joint  Reconciliation Program, the Army saved  millions of dollars during FY  1997. Although most funds that Congress appropriates can be  obligated only in the year in  which  appropriated,  multiyear funds  may  be obligated for  a  specified period. Once that period is over, the funds are expired; after five years as an expired appropriation, the funds are canceled and can11ot be used to pay for past obligations. Current year appropriated funds must be used, however, to pay  any  valid  invoice  for  an  obligation  associated  with  a  canceled appropriation, restricting the amount of  obligations the Army can make in

that year and providing it with  less purchasing power than intended in  the budget process. To ensure that expired appropriations are reconciled and paid before :five years have passed, the Army has been working with DFAS to reconcile unpaid obligations.  Under this Joint Reconciliation Program, the Army has succeeded in retaining the total obligation authority for the current  year and substantially reducing the amount offunds that would have had to be used to pay for invoices associated with canceled appropriations. Of the $798 million in potential canceled appropriations in FY 1997, the Joint  Reconciliation  Program  reconciled  all  but $10.6  million  in  valid invoices, reducing the Army's current liability to only  1.3 percent of  what it would have endured otherwise.

In certain  cases,  disputes  between  contractors  and  the  government result in litigation, a costly process in time and money for all participants. To  reduce  these  difficulties,  the  government  has turned  to  the  business practices of partnering and alternate dispute resolution.  With partnering, which is a technique designed to avoid disputes altogether, the government and the contractor try to work as a team to resolve potential disagreements at the  beginning of a contract, transforming an often adversarial  process into  a  cooperative one. Protests about contract awards  and  disputes still arise,  however,  and  alternate  dispute  resolution  is  the  process  used  to avoid  litigation.  Using alternate dispute  resolution  techniques, the Army has  resolved  contract claims  and  appeals  from  small  amounts  to  more than $50 million. The Office of  Federal Procurement Policy voted AMC's alternate dispute resolution program as  one  of the  ten  best government programs  during  FY  1997.  As  of the  end  of FY  1997,  more  than  425 protests have been :filed under AMC's program rather than  at GAO or in federal  court. Likewise, the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers has reversed a tremendous number oflitigious cases through a formal partnering program and alternate dispute resolution. Contract claims were reduced 69 percent between 1986 and 1995 (the last full calendar year of  information) and 34 percent between  1993 and  1995.

The Army also discovered it was losing money to soldiers who were discharged from the service. About 28 percent of  all soldiers who separated from active duty in FY 1995 owed a debt, usually caused by overpayment of pay,  allowances,  entitlements,  leave,  bonuses,  transportation  costs, or  travel  advances,  or  from  the  soldier's  liability  for  lost  or  damaged government  property.  These  debts  were  usually  not  identified  during  a soldier's outprocessing and  were difficult,  labor intensive,  and  costly  to collect after the soldier left active duty. To resolve the problem, the assistant secretary of the Army  for financial management and comptroller and the deputy  chief of staff for  personnel  initiated  a  debt  avoidance  program that  instituted  a  standardized  and  comprehensive  separation  checklist and  incorporated  more  rigorous  outprocessing  procedures  throughout

the Army. The new checklist, which  was  tested in  the  field  in  FY  I  996, makes soldiers more  responsible for properly clearing an  installation and requires a validating signature from  unit commanders. A soldier who fails to  complete the checklist will  receive only 55  percent of final  pay due at the  time  of separation.  Once DFAS  has  verified  that  the  soldier has  no outstanding debts,  DFAS  will  issue a final  payment to  the soldier within thirty days following separation. This program has reduced to  23 percent the proportion of  soldiers indebted to the Army after separation and by 27 percent the amount of  money owed to the Army by separated soldiers.

Stewardship  of the  resources  the  Army  possesses  is  an  extremely important factor in reducing costs. At the installation level, the Army has instituted or expanded a number of programs that emulate smart business practices  to  offset  the  impact of downsizing  and  constrained  resources while  improving  service  and  reducing  installation  costs.  One  of these programs  is  the  Electronic  Commerce/Electronic  Data  Interchange,  in which solicitations and contract information are submitted electronically. The  goal  of this  program  is  to  create  a  paperless  contracting  process, beginning  with  computer-generated  customer  requirements  and  ending with electronic payments, to  reduce administrative costs, decrease errors, encourage competition, and shorten the lead-time for procurement actions. The Army currently  leads  the federal  government  in  reaching  this  goal, with  more than 90 percent of its sites capable  of transmitting electronic commerce/electronic data interchange information via the Federal Acquisition Network.

The driving force behind the Army's Facilities  Management Program is  the goal to reduce costs and manage facilities more efficiently. With that in  mind, the Army has privatized some utility systems, demolished excess buildings,  and  reduced  the  number of leases  it  holds.  Because some of these measures, such as faci lities disposal, require a commitment of  funds before savings can be realized, the Army is challenged to accomplish these actions as quickly as possible. The Army  plans to privatize  I  00 percent of its  natural  gas systems and 75 percent of its other utility systems  within CONUS by  FY 2003. Under the utilities privatization program, the Army transfers  its ownership and responsibility for operation, maintenance, and upgrade to a  local utility provider,  resulting  in  savings  for  the Army.  By the end of  FY 1997, the Army had privatized  15 systems (8 gas, 3 electric, l  water, and 3 wastewater plants) and is currently studying the transfer of 166 additional  utility systems.

In  another  successful  effort  to  trim  expenses,  the  Army  has  just completed  a  five-year  Facility  Reduction  Program,  in  which more  than 39 million square feet of unneeded  buildings were eliminated.  Although the disposal  of unnecessary facilities frees  resources to maintain needed faci lities,  this  process  has  also  required  the  Army  to  spend  about $100

million a year  to accomplish  the  reductions. Because  the five-year program did  not eliminate all  unnecessary facilities, the Army  wi ll  spend $89  million  each  year,  beginning  with  FY  1999,  to  reduce  its  facility inventory.  Another Army  goal is  to  reduce  by  $198  million  the amount of money  spent on  leased  facilities through  the end  of FY 2003. Nearly 50 percent of all leasing costs arc clue to  recruiting and military entrance processing activities being housed in  nongovernment  facilities. Wherever possible, the Army is moving these functions out of  leased space and onto installations; otherwise, the Army is attempting to reduce the size and cost of  leased  faci  ities. I

The Army is also realizing savings by expanding its usc of  technology. In  the  usage of the International Merchant Purchase Authorization Cards (IMPAC), the  Army is the government leader in both number of  transactions and dollar amounts. During FY  1997, the 2 million transactions made by 43,000 Army  soldiers  and  civilians  resulted  in  $1 billion  in  purchases. This represents  an  increase since  FY  1 996 of 25  percent in  the  number of transactions,  16 percent  in  the number of cardholders, and  35  percent in  the  value of purchases. The  purchase card  is  used  instead  of purchase orders  for  micro-purchases, those of commercially available off-the-shelf items valued at $2;500 or less. The Army used the IMPAC for 89 percent of all  micro-purchases in FY  1997.  Elimination of purchase orders for these transactions  has saved the Army  millions of dollars  in direct  labor costs. In  add ition, the Army uses one line of  accounting to fund each cardholder account  rather  than  each  individual  purchase,  reducing  the  labor  costs associated with processing purchase card  transactions.

An innovative program designed to provide electronic money to Army basic  trainees was implemented  during FY  1997 on a  pi lot basis  at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and  Fort  Knox, Kentucky.  Upon entering basic training at either installation, soldiers were presented with a Stored Value Carel,  or Smart  Card,  credited  with  a certain  dollar  amount,  rather  than receiving the traditional cash advance. The soldier used the Smart Card, in the same  fashion  as. a debit card, to  pay  for toiletries, haircuts, and other personal  items on the installation, as well  as special events sponsored  by Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Services.  When training was completed and the soldier was ready to depart the installation, banks and creel it unions on  the  installation  redeemed  the  Smart  Card  and  provided  cash  to  the soldier in the dollar amount remaining on the card. A partnership between the U.S. Department ofTreasury, O. MS, the Army, the First Union Bank in Missouri, and the Mellon Bank in Kentucky enabled the program to operate successfully.  In addition  to  ensuring that soldiers were  less  vulnerable to theft  because  they  were  not  encumbered  by  large amounts  of cash, the program eliminated the U.S. Treasury's need to send millions of  dollars in cash to these installations, freeing the cash  for other purposes.

In  a  similar program, the Army  has  been  planning and  preparing an Automated  Meal Tickets  system  that  will  be  put  in  place  in  FY  1998. Military personnel in transit, particularly new recruits en route to their first duty station, will be provided with Automated Meal  Tickets to pay for meals in commercial restaurants when government facilities are unavailable. The Army expects to save $6- 8 per meal ticket, measured against the current labor-intensive system of manually issuing meal  tickets and reimbursing the vendor.

Another  initiative,  specifically  designed to assist  commanders  in stretching  their  travel  funds,  is  the  Lodging  Success  Program,  which began in  1992. The Army negotiates with high-quality hotels that provide transportation  to  and  from airports  and  frequently  visited  temporary duty  locations  to  obtain volume  discounts  on  room  rates.  In  FY  1997, the Lodging Success Program was operating in  the metropolitan areas of Washington,  D.C.;  San Antonio,  Texas;  and  Atlanta,  Georgia.  Reduced lodging rates  were  about 30 to 40 percent below the per diem rates that the government had previously authorized  for  those regions.  In addition, travelers  had  no  need  of a  rental  car,  further  reducing  costs.  The Army contracted  for  225,000  room-nights during FY  1997, with  an estimated saving of $10- 12  million.  Not only  will the Army expand  the  Lodging Success Program to the Norfolk area in FY 1998, but also DOD is planning to adopt the program for all services.

Seven Army installations were selected as pilot sites to implement new initiatives  in  1995  as part of  DOD's  effort to  reengineer travel. At one of those sitesthe Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas› the processing of  official government travel  was drastically reduced from 37 to 9 steps, and the processing time per voucher decreased from  5.4 to I .3  hours.  As a  result,  soldiers and civilians  were  reimbursed  within  24 to  36 hours after presenting their travel  vouchers directly  to  the finance office. The Combined Arms  Center  and  Fort Leavenworth  was  one  of three  federal  organizations to  receive Government Ewcutive Magazine's Travel Manager of the Year Award for 1997. The pmcess used at all seven sites will  be the foundation  for the Defense Travel System that will soon encompass all of  DOD.

The Army continued to  use the government travel card to  reduce the need for travel  advances and  to emphasize the collection of outstanding travel  advances. On 30 September 1997, reported travel advances totaled $62 million,  a  decrease of 15  percent since 30 September  1996 and  the third consecutive fiscal year in which a reduction had occurred.

To gain  more control over funds, ASA (FM&amp;C) established a team to review the Military Training Open Allotments, which funded per diem and travel  for training directed  by  HQDA and per diem for training en route to a PCS. The open allotments provided funds through a fund site that any

authorized fiscal station in the Army could use, creating a system similar to  a  joint  checking  account  with  many  co-owners  who  could  ali  write checks to withdraw money. Although open allotments provided flexibility and  easy  access  in  the  field,  there  was  no  control  over  how  the  funds would be spent and  limited opportunity for analyzing expenditures once they were made. Without priorities or controls on spending, unnecessary expenditures  occurred;  and,  despite  the  active  Army's decline  in  size during  the  1990s,  military training open allotments  increased. The Army conducted a successful pilot test at two Army  installations in FY  1997  in which the commands were given mil itary training specific allotments that enabled them to control their own funds, establish their funding priorities, and  prevent access to  the  funds  from  outside  the command.  During FY 1998,  the  Army  will  switch  from  military  training  open  allotments  to military training specific aUotments Army-wide.

The  Army  must  also  maintain  vigilance  against  fraud if it is to protect and conserve  its resources. The Major Procurement Fraud Unit, a subordinate  element of the U.S. Army Criminal  Investigation Command, conducted  major procurement fraud  investigations involving centralized Army contracts,  major  systems  acquisitions,  military  construction,  and civil works  contracts  and  projects.  Following  criminal  convictions  of, and  civil  administrative settlements with,  contractors who  defrauded  the Army,  reclaimed or awarded funds are sent to the Treasury Department's General Fund, although an increasing amount has been given to the Army in  recent  years  for  goods and  services. During  FY 1997, $83.1  million was returned to the Treasury and $60.1 mi Ilion to the Army.  In addition to returning funds and property to Army activities,  the  fraud  unit identified serious hazards to personnel safety and health as well as to enhanced Army readiness and combat effectiveness.

## Legislation

Legislation  has  both  required and  assisted  the Army  in  developing acquisition  practices  consistent  with  smart  business  practices,  so  that resources can be protected and used more effectively and efficiently. Under the Chief  Financial Officers Act of 1990, federal agencies were required to centralize financial management, appoint a chief  financial officer, prepare audited  fi nancial  statements,  and  modernize  their  financial  information systems. The Army was designated  a  pilot agency and  has aggressively implemented the  Chief Financial Officers Act's provisions. To  fulfill  the requirements of  this act, the Army has been breaking down the traditional barriers between  functional  and  financial  managers  and  working  to improve every aspect of  financial  management and stewardship. In the FY J 997 Annual  Financial Report, auditors highlighted the Army's progress.

Full compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act cannot take place, however,  until  reliable,  integrated financial  systems  and  processes  are  in place.  Until  then,  Army  auditors  are  unable  to  assess  the  reliabi lity  of data  in  the Army  Financial Report,  although continual  improvements  in accounting controls, processes, and systems have been made since 1990.

Congress passed the Government Performance and Resu Its Act (  GPRA) of 1993 as another measure to  create efficient and effective government. The act requires agencies, including DOD, to develop strategic plans and goals,  identify how  those goals  will  be  achieved,  measure performance, and  make  adjustments  to  ensure  that  the  goals  are  met.  The  May  1997 Report of  the Quadrennial Defense Review served as DOD's  strategic plan. With  Army  participation,  DOD  developed  performance  measurements in  September  1997  based on the  Quadrennial  Defense  Review's (QDR) most  critical  strategic  goals.  Although  a  DOD  memorandum  directing each  military service to develop  its own strategic and  performance plans remains  unsigned  and  with  no  suspense  date,  the Army  is  revising  its Army  SMP  to  implement the GPRA. The SMP  is  based  on  the Army's strategy, imperatives,  goals,  and  longand  short-term  objectives.  To ensure correlation with DOD strategic and performance plans, the Army is rewriting its objectives so that they will be quantifiable and measurable.

New  legislation is  giving  significant  impetus  to  the  privatization  of housing. The Housing Revitalization Act of  1996 permits the establishment of  partnerships between public and private agencies and allows the federal government  to  provide  various  types  of guarantees  to  attract  private investment.  The  act  also  created  a Defense Housing Improvement Fund into which funds  from  housing appropriations can be  transferred.  Under the  authority  of the  act,  which  expands  flexibility  and  opportunity  for privatization  of housing,  an Army  team is currently working to  improve Army housing through additional privatization efforts.

The Army plays a significant role in proposing legislation to Congress. The Resource Analysis and Business Practices Office in OASA  (FM&amp;C) is responsible  for  aggressively  soliciting,  developing,  and  submitting legislative  proposals that  will provide  Army commanders with the  flexibility to generate additional fimds and maximize the use of  their resources.  During FY  1997, the Resource Analysis and Business Practices Office proposed, and Congress passed, legislation that will allow the Army to retain refunds from official  government travel, provided that the government travel card or a government contracted travel  management center is used to pay  for or arrange the  travel. The Army estimates that it will receive $10 million annually  as  a  result  of this  legislative  change.  Installations  will  use  the funds to pay for base operations.

The  Resource  Analysis  and  Business  Practices  Office  also  gained congressional  approval in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal

Year 1998 for two initiatives that will reduce printing costs.  The act permits DOD to contract directly with the Government Printing Office for printing and  duplication  services  and  prohibits  the  Defense  Automated  Printing Service  from  requiring  a  5.5  percent  surcharge  for  DOD  publications. These initiatives, which make government printing costs competitive with the private sector, will  lower DOD costs.

Legislative  restrictions  also  need to be  eliminated.  The  Resource Analysis and Business Practices Office has  identified such instances and provided  suggestions  on  new  legislation  for  DOD  and  Army  leaders  to use when discussing outsourcing with Congress. The Resource Analysis and  Business Practices Office  is presently assisting DOD  in  preparing a legislative package that wi II  request rei  icf  from many of  these restrictions. Congress also approved a recent legislative proposal that allows DOD to retain funds collected from assessments for damage to Army real  property assets. ln addition, the Army and  DOD obtained approval for 32 waivers of financial  regulations  and  policy,  enabling the  Army  to  attain  greater efficiency and reduce costs.

## Accountability

In  1991 DOD established DFAS and charged it with developing a single corporate database  to  support all  DOD  finance  and  accounting functions. Five years later,  DOD directed that a transaction-driven general accounting system  be acquired for DFAS-Inclianapolis customers. DFAS in 1997 released a transition strategy for general and business fund accounting system s.  In the initial phase, each military service and defense agency will  replace existing systems with the  best  intermediate  systems available.  ln  the  final  phase, these intermediate systems will  be replaced  by a single DOD-wide system. Following an analysis of  alternatives, DFAS selected the Corps ofEngineers Financial  Management  System  to  create  the  Defense  Joint  Accounting System  (DJAS).  DJAS  will  modernize  and  upgrade  the  Army  system to create an  integrated  financial accounting  system for  DOD  that  will  meet Joint  Financial Management Improvement Program standards and be fully compliant with the financial  reporting requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act.  Tlu·ough DJAS, customers wi ll  be able to  perform functions such as funds control, general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, financial reports, cost management, and core financial systems management. Customers supported by DJAS will include army posts, camps, and stations; AMC;  Army  National Guard (ARNG);  DFAS- lndianapolis; and the Military Traffic  Management  Command.  DJAS  will  support accounting, finance, and reporting operations at the installation, MACOM, and  military department levels. To ensure that DJAS is fielded on schedule, the Army has been working with  the DJAS  program office,  which  developed  the DJAS

program structure during FY  1997. This seamless integration of  the financial and  accounting capabilities  of Army  and  defense  agencies  supports Joint Vision 20  I  0 and the attainment of information dominance.

As  early  as  FY 1990,  DOD  identified  accountability  for  real  and personal  property  as  a  high-risk area.  The  Federal  Managers' Financial Integrity  Act  (FMFIA)  of  1 982  requires  all  federal agencies  to  assess the  effectiveness  of their  management  controls  and  financial  systems and  to  provide an  annua I statement for Congress and  the president by 31 December, identifying any deficiencies and outlining resolutions. By 1993 DOD recognized that it needed a standard property accountability system to  eliminate  weaknesses  discovered  while  fulfill ing  the  requirements  of the  FMFIA and  the  Chief Financial Officers Act. The  Defense Property Accounting  System  (DPAS),  developed  by  DOD  to  manage  real  and personal property for all defense agencies, provides on-line comprehensive property accountability and  integrated equipment management,  including preventive maintenance schedules. Incorporating automated  logistics and financial intcrf~tces, DPAS complies with  all  DOD  financial  regulations for asset accountability,  general ledger reporting, and depreciation.  With DPAS,  item  authorizations,  cataloging  of actions,  accountable  record processing, financial depreciation data, serial number tracking, component visibility, warranty  information,  maintenance  records,  utilization  data, and  an  automated  document  register can  be  validated  on-line.  Although DOD  has  not  mandated  that  the  military services  switch  their  property accountability systems  to  DPAS,  the Army had fielded  DPAS at 67  sites, or 70 percent  of all  Army  locations,  by  the  end  of FY  1997. The Army will  implement  DPAS  at  its  remaining  locations  once  a  test  has  been succcssfuJJy completed  in  FY  1998.

Despite the improvements made in accountability, problem disbursements continued to  be one of the primary financial  concerns for the Army and DOD in FY  1997.  Problem disbursements are Army funds that  have  not  yet  been  matched  against  the  specific  source  obligation document or that do not agree with the amount of  the original obligation. As a result  of problem  disbursements, accounting reports arc  inaccurate, and  availability  of funds  is  difficult  to  determine.  Eliminating  problem disbursements becomes more difficult and labor intensive as they age. As of 30 September 1997  the Army  reported  problem  disbursements  in  the amount of $1.7 billion. Although  this  amount is lower than  that reported in  FY  1996, the diff erence resulted from a change in reporting procedures rather than an improvement in financial accountability.

The  key  organization  in the  Army  designated  to  audit  contractor claims, a central function in ensuring financial accountability, is AAA. As the Total Army decreased  in  size during the  1990s, so did AJ\1\. Having assembled a Restructuring Task  Force  in  FY  1994, AAA continued  with

Phase II of its restructuring in  FY  J  997, closing five f1cld  offices and four administrative  centers.  As  a  result,  the  number  of military  and  civilian employees  in  AAA  declined  during  the  fiscal  year to  60 I , although 668 positions were authorized. With the closing of numerous  facilities,  some personnel were  relocated  to  other geographical  areas.  Even  with  fewer people, AAA continued to establish process action teams to evaluate Army processes  that  required  improvement.  Moreover,  AAA  retained  a  high standard of  performance and submitted an application  in  FY  1997 for the Presidential Award  for Quality.

One of the AAA divisions restructured in FY  1997 was the Programs and  Audit Support  Division.  Direct  support to  audit  teams  had  resided previously in the division but was transferred to an AAA audit directorate, leaving  the  division  with  providing  statistical  sampling  and  advanced audit techniques.  l .n the summer of 1 997  the division  replaced  the AAA Information Management System with the Agency Management System. In  addition,  the  division  completed  AAA's transition  to  localand  wide› area  networks  and  developed  a  network  operations group  to  ensure  the smooth transition of  AAA elements as they went on-line.

To  improve  the  fulfillment  of its  mission, AAA  implemented  a  new coordinated audit process in  FY  1997 after two  years of  study and  testing. ln  previous years the audit process had  become an adversarial relationship between the auditor and the client; clients and auditors did not always agree on solutions needed for some audit findings; and the official Army position on  audit  findings  and  recommendations  was  usually  not  provided  until months after a report was issued. After surveying customers, AAA worked with  MACOM representatives to develop a new coordinated audit process. Under  an innovative  philosophy that  encourages  partnership between auditor and client, the client is now involved in the entire audit process from the  planning phase to  the reporting phase. Jn  addition, the auditors and  the client jointly decide on the solutions recommended in the report. Finally, the Army's official position on findings and recommendations is included in the final  report. After conducting pilot audits, AAA began using the process in FY 1997 and will completely implement it during FY  1998.

To  ensure that  its  auditors  have  the  appropriate  leadership  skills, AAA established a h·ain  ing partnership with the Air Force Audit Agency in FY 1996 and  developed  the  Leadership  Development Course. The curriculum teaches team  building,  leadersh ip skiiJs, competencies, ethics, and  how  to work with people.  Leadership  skills  are  sometimes  necessmy  for  auditors  placed in positions other than supervisor or manager.  Forty Army auditors attended the course during FY  1997, and forty-eight arc projected to attend in FY  1998.

AAA has also been  involved in acquisition reform.  Under the GPRA, federal  agencies were required  to  develop strategic  plans  for  FY  1998 by September  1997, annual  performance  plans  for every  budget activity  for

FY  1999 by September 1997, and annual performance reports beginning in  March  2000. The  GPRA designated  seventy pilot projects  to  ensure that  performance  measures  would  be  developed  to  compare  requested resources with results. As one of  the Army's  three selected pilot agencies, AAA streamlined its operations by reducing personnel nearly 35 percent, realigned  audit  resources  to  match  more  closely  Army  functions,  and expanded  its consulting  services.  Customer satisfaction  increased  from 3.95 out of  a possible score of  5 in FY  1994 to 4.1 6 in FY  1997.

During FY  1997 AAA participated for the first time in the West Point Cadet summer program. AAA developed a project that cadets would  be able to accomplish in  a two-week period during the summer. Two cadets selected AAA's project in information management and spent two weeks at AAA, providing significant contributions to  the project and  benefiting AAA as well as themselves.

AAA continued to play a vital role tlu·oughout FY 1997 by performing audits. In  one  of  the most  significant,  the  audit  of  the  Acquisition Arrangement with the liungarian Ministry of  Defense, AAA concluded that the Army had not been overcharged for bus services. An internal audit for U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), had claimed that the Ministry of  Defense had presented a bill of  $1.9 million for bus services, of  which $1.2 million represented  overcharges.  USAREUR's  internal  audit  report  was  leaked to  the American and Hungarian press, and the allegations created a tense international atmosphere. According to theAAA  audit issued in March 1997, USAREUR did  not  review  sufficient  documentation  and used  incorrect criteria  to  define  overcharges.  AAA  reviewed  all  67  purchase  orders  for the $33.3 million of  goods and services provided through the Acquisition Arrangement and  concluded  that  USAREUR was  charged  properly. As an aside, AAA reported that USAREUR had not always followed  prudent procurement practices, expending some resources unnecessarily.

The audit ofPlant Operations, Johnston  Atoll Chemical Agent  Disposal System, issued in November 1996, stated that using other measures could have  saved $26.1 million. The audit  reviewed  the  management of plant operations  and  delivery processes  for  chemical  munitions,  focusing on personnel staffing, demilitarization schedules, lessons learned, compliance with safety and  environmental guidelines,  and management controls.  The  AAA  audi.t  determined  that process  improvements  were necessary to  ensure  that a  successful chemical  demilitarization  program was  completed as  scheduled. The commander,  U.S. Army,  Pacific,  and the  program director for  Chemical  Demilitarization agreed with AAA's recommendations and  the estimate  of potential savings. This audit was one of  the TI.rst to  be published that included the official Army position.

At the request of the  under secretary of the Army, AAA conducted an  audit  of Contractor  Support  for  the  Logistics  Civil  Augmentation

Program  (LOGCAP),  focusing  on  the  processes  used  to  request  and monitor contractor support for Operation JOINT ENDGAVOR. Before the audit, ODCSLOG and AMC had  already implemented numerous  initiatives to update and expand program guidance, doctrine, and training on contractor support.  AAA  concluded  in  December  1996  that  the  Army  needed  to evaluate a contractor' s cost estimate and expenditures in a timelier manner; monitor the services provided by a contractor more fully; implement a plan for  surveillance and inspection of contractor performance;  and evaluate contractor  performance  to determine  future  award  fees.  ODCSLOG and  AMC  agreed  with  most  of AAA's  recommendations,  and  AMC incorporated many of the suggestions  in  developing and awarding a  new LOGCAP contract in FY 1997.

AAA's audit of Management of  Repair Parts for Maintenance, issued in  March  1997, demonstrated  that Army depots supporting maintenance operations  needed  to  improve  their  management  of repair  parts  to  be cost-effective. Problems  identified included multiple layers of  retail inventories,  redundant  handling of material,  fragmented  management of inventory,  and  inadequate  visibility  and  control  over  inventory.  Depots tended to retain excessive amounts of  inventory and procured unnecessary repair parts.  AAA  stated  that  the  Army  could  save $5  million annually by  reenginecring  the  process  to  eliminate  repetitive  handling and  avoid supply fees.  In  addition,  the Army could  save $12.6  million  during  FY 1997 by  disposing of  excess material. The audit also concluded that the Army could reduce order ship times by two to four days and depots could minimize  their  purchase  of unneeded  repair  parts.  The  Army's official position agreed  with  AAA  recommendations  and  estimates  of potential monetary benefits.

## Budget

The Army budget continued to decline in FY 1997. During FYs 198997  the Army's total  obligation authority  declined  ti·om $ 100.3  to  $64.8 billion, representing a 35 percent decrease in purchasing power. In constant dollars,  the  FY  1997 Army  budget declined 2.5 percent from that of FY 1996. In FY J  997, the  Army's  share of  DOD's  total obligation authority was 24 percent, a reduction of3 percent since FY 1989, despite the fact that the Army had provided 60 percent of  all U.S.  military forces committed to the 33 major DOD contingency operations during the same period. Beginning in FY 1999, however, the Army budget will increase $2.2 billion over FY 1998's request, with $1.6 billion earmarked for modernization.  Excluding Operation DESERT  STORM,  this  is  the  first planned  increase in  the 1\.rmy's total obligation authority since 1985. The Army's  total obligation authority for  FY  s J 997- 99 is shown in Table 1.

Table  lArmy Total Obligation Authority, Fiscal  Years  1997- 1999

*Numbers may not add up owing to rounding

In addition to affecting modernization, maintenance, and procurement of  equipment, lower levels of  funding continued to affect theAnny's  ability to attract high-quality people and provide them with the necessary training. As buying  power declined, Army leaders have acquired an additional burden in  assuming roles  in  resource allocation and cost measurement to  ensure that the Total Army has the quality, capabilities, and size to deter potential adversaries  and  meet  operational  conu11itments.  Despite  cutbacks,  the Army has used its available resources effectively and continues to possess a trained and  ready force. The Army's  FY  1997 budget included funds for ongoing military contingencies and operations, but did not contain funding for unprogrammed missions.  Conducting unprogrammed  missions, such as responses to natural disasters or new military contingencies, adversely affected  the Army's ability  to  maintain readiness and  quality of life. The Army is continuing to work with Congress and DOD to identify a method for f· uncling these missions.

In April or May of each year,  DOD submits to  Congress an omnibus reprogramming action that incorporates all reprogramming requests submitted by the military services.  The  dollar  amount  of  submitted requirements must  equal the dollar amount  of  previously approved appropriations  and  is  merely  a  request  to  realign  funds.  Congressional

approval is normally given late in the fiscal year; thus DOD implemented the FY 1997 Omnibus Reprogramming Action in September 1997. The Army's part included  $33.1  million in FY 1997 requirements and offsetting sources and  $3.9  million for  FY  1995. The  FY  1997 requirements  would  transfer funds from Military Personnel, Army, to  National Guard Personnel, Army, to support the  Operational Support Airlift Command. Those requirements would also realign f· unds from Reserve Personnel, Army, to Operations and Maintenance, Army Reserve, for base support, real property maintenance, and Pentagon renovation. Finally, funds would be transferred from Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Defense to Operations and Maintenance, Army (OMA), for chemical demilitarization activities. Although Congress approved  all  of the Army's requirements,  it cl. id  not approve  the  FY  1995 source, leaving the FY 1995 requirement unt1Jnded.

Before  executing  the  FY  1997  WRAP,  the  Army  was  required  to present its  list of  FY  1997 WRAP candidates to Congress. Following the AWE in March 1997, the CSA approved eleven Force XXI initiatives under WRAP. The Army notified  Congress  that the FY  1997 WRAP projects would  require  a  commitment  of FY  1998  funds.  Of the  $100  million request for WRAP in the FY 1998 President's  Budget, the Army estimated that $62 would  be used for FY  1997 WRAP projects and $38 million to pursue new FY 1998 WRAP candidates. Congress approved the initiatives in  July  1997.  Although  the  House Appropriations  Committee  approved the $100  million  request  in  the  FY  1998  President's Budget,  the Senate Appropriations  Committee  approved  only  $62  million.  The  Army  has forwarded an appeal to the Senate urging support of the House position. Passage of the House position would enable the Army to conduct WRAP on a one-year cycle, rather than extend it to a two-year period as the Senate position would require.

During FY  s 1998- 2003 POM, the Army incorporated QDR decisions and Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) to wrest $5 billion in savings from efficie11cies in  infrastructure, as well as from reductions in force structure and end strength. With these initiatives, the Army reallocated those f· unds for  modernization,  infrastructure,  and recruiting  programs.  The  FYs 1998- 2003 POM provided funds for ten divisions and 480,000 personnel in the  active  Army,  fifteen  enhanced  brigades  in  ARNG,  and  530,000 personnel in the reserve components. In addition to funding air and ground operating tempo  (OPTEMPO)  to  meet readiness  levels specified  by  the DPG, the FYs  1998- 2003 POM funded training requirements in support of digitization, Force XXI  initiatives,  and conversion of combat units  to combat support or combat service support roles. The largest increase in the FYs 1998- 2003 POM was $3.2 billion for modernization. An additional $1.3  billion was allocated for fielding the digitized corps and $1.1 billion to reduce the shortage of  combat  support and combat  service support units.

Funding  of real  property maintenance  was  increased  by  $1  billion  and depot maintenance by  $362 million,  while  base operations requirements were  reduced  by $ l  .3  billion.  In  addition,  funding  for  communications to  improve  deployment  support  and  distance  learning  capabilities  was increased.  To ensure  the  Army  creates the leap-ahead technologies required by the Army After Next, another $437 million was budgeted for acquisition stability and science and technology programs. Nevertheless, not all critical requirements were funded.

The  FY  1999  budget  estimate  submission  (BES)  contained  only minimal program adjustments to  the FY  s  1998- 2003 POM  and reflected probable  congressional  actions,  repricing, realignment  of  acquisition strategy,  and  revisions to correct for slips in  program execution. The FY 1999 BES preserved ground OPTEMPO at 800 miles per vehicle and air OPTEMPO at 14.0 flying hours per aircraft (14.5  for attack helicopters) for  the  active  Army,  with  comparable  funding  appropriate  to  mission requirements  for  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  and ARNG.  OPTEMPO  is  a framework for estimating costs of fuel;  spare parts;  and  recurring home station  operations, training, and  maintenance,  based  on  w1it-speci.fic events.  Increased  modernization  funding  was  included  for  the  AH- 64 Longbow  Apache,  the  UH- 60  Black  Hawk  helicopter  modifications, the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the Ml Abrams tank, and the Hellfire  missile.  In  addition,  the  BES  continued  funding  for the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles and the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles. Base operations fund ing will  increase from 78 percent of  requirements in FY 1998 to 85 percent in FY 1999, which should minimize the transfer of OMA funds. In theBES, quality of  life and soldier support programs, such as  barracks  modernization,  continuing  education,  housing  maintenance and  repair,  and  pay  raises,  are  adequately  funded.  The  budget will  not provide for all  of the Army's needs,  however, and shortfalls will  prevent full  funding  for  the  Army's digitization effort,  ammunition  war  reserve modernization, drawdown replacement, depleted uranium production gap, Second Destination  Transportation, ammunition sustainment, supply depot operations, and  real  property maintenance.  Minimal funding  is  provided for revitalization.

In  1995  the  Army  Budget  Office  initiated efforts  to  reengineer  the programming  and  budgeting  phases  of  the Planning,  Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES) to decrease the difficulty and complexity of  developing, submitting, and monitoring the execution of  the POM and  the Army  budget.  Factors  that  necessitated  the  reengineering included reduced financial resources, fewer Army personnel, a demand for improved stewardship of  Army resources, and a perceived need to connect all phases  of PPBES.  In  addition,  reengineering  the  PPBES  process became an  important element in fully  implementing the  GPRA  and  the

QDR recommendations, which demanded better resource management and smarter business practices. As of the end of FY  1997, the reengineering process has  removed the artificial boundaries  between  the  POM and the budget and integrated them into one resource decision process. The new process  reduced  the  size of budget schedules required  from  subordinate commands  by  two-thirds  and  streamlined  the  preparation  of the  DOD budget. Inefficiencies and  inconsistencies in DOD reporting requirements for procurement appropriations were identified for correction and simplification.  For  the  first  time,  the  Army simu.ltaneously  documented and improved its PPBES process, creating a nine-volume Army Resource Formulation Guide and publishing the initialllve volumes.

The  Chief Financial  Officers Act,  as  amended  by  the  Government Management Reform Act of 1994, required  federal agencies to  prepare annual  financial  reports.  Based  on  OMB  and  DOD  requirements  and guidelines,  the  Army  prepared  the  FY  1997  Annual  Financial  Report, which is  intended  to gi ve a clear picture of the Army's  :financial position. The report consisted of  the statement of  financial position, the statement of operations and changes in net position, and the statement of  cash flows as of30 September 1997. The statement of  financial position included $215.3 billion in assets,  $36.4  billion in  liabilities,  and  a  net position of $178.8 billion.  The  net  position  was  composed  of unexpended  appropriations, invested  capital,  cumulative  results  of operations,  and  future  funding requirements.  As  a  comparison,  in  FY  1996  the Army  had  $201  billion in  assets, $25.3  bi.llion  in  liabilities, and  a  net  position  of  $175.7  billion. Equipment, real estate, and physical plants composed more than 61  percent of  Army assets, with war reserves another 22 percent. Fourteen percent of the Army's assets, $30.6 billion, were in Treasury accounts, with virtually the entire amount coming from appropriated funds. Unfortunately, auditors have been unable to determine the reliability of  data in the Army's  financial statements, although each successive  annual audit  has  noted  continuing improvements in accounting controls, processes, and systems.

The  Army  reported  $1.3  billion  in  accounts  receivable  and  $2.3 billion  in  accounts  payable  at the  end  of FY  1997,  but  an  AAA  audit concluded  that these amounts were unreliable and  that correct balances could  not  be  determined.  Although  the  Army  reported  $27.7  billion  in nonfederalliabilities not covered by budgetary resources, the audit could not verify  that all  reportable  liabilities  were  properly  identified.  For  the first  time these  nonfederal  liabilities  included $10.6  billion  for  chemical demilitarization programs, $972 million for environmental restoration at closing installations, $414 million for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, and $185 mi Ilion for claims and I itigation. The Army could not audit the  $65.4  billion  of expenses  for  FY  1997  owing  to  a  deficiency in  the accounting systems used. The Defense Accounting Service, which

owns and  operates the Army's primary accounting systems,  is  preparing a new  system  to  replace those currently  in  use.  The Army  reported  $4.6 billion as  assets under capital  lease when  they should  have been  reported as  overseas real  property  assets.  ln  the  future,  such  real  property  will  be reported  as  real property  assets.  Although  the  Army  stated  that  its  fund balance with the U.S. Treasury was $30.6 billion, the audit concluded that the amount was probably understated by $1.4 billion.

Accounting for Army property, plant, and equipment is one of  the most difficult  problems  in  forming  an  accurate  financial  statement.  The  total value placed on this category by the Army on 30 September 1997 was $132 billion, but AAA stated that reporting problems most  likely resulted  in  an understatement of$10 billion. Reported values for real  property were often misstated, duplicated, or incomplete. For example, the Army did not record its  financial  interest  in  ARNG  facilities  as  an  asset,  but this  deficiency  is being corrected. The Army  developed  new accounting procedures for  real property in FY  1997, but these had not been approved by the end of  the fiscal year. Reported values for construction projects were also misstated owing to inaccurate or incomplete contractor reports. In  FY 1997, the Army conducted a review of government properly  in  the custody of contractors, the  largest part of  the accounting problem related to property, plant, and equipment. The Army also commissioned a study of  practices used by foreign governments and commercial businesses that could improve the Army's accountability of contractor-held government property.

Finally, AAA performed a worldwide validation of  Army property in FY 1997, working with the 1nspector General, DOD, and GAO. Concentrating on · five mission  asset  categories (aircraft, combat  tracked vehicles, communications  equipment,  missi les,  and  missile  support  equipment), the  study concluded that  the Army  maintains good  accountability at  the unit level even during times of frequent deployments and rapid turnover of personnel. Nevertheless, the audit also found that the Army has overstated the  value  of its  military  equipment.  In  one  example,  the  Army  valued military equipment  at the latest acquisition cost or standard price rather than the actual  cost. The Army reported the value of its war reserves as $46.8 billion  on  30  September  1 997,  but  this  amount  was  overstated  because assets  in  excess  or in an  unknown condition were valued at  Cull  price.  Tn previous  years,  the Army  had  also  reported  unserviceable  equipment  at full  value.  In  FY  1997, AMC reduced  the  value  of repairable equipment to  35  percent  of its  standard  unit  price  and  nonrepairable  equipment  to a salvage  value of 2.7 percent of the standard price,  which  more closely reflected actual values.

## Personnel

The Total  Army  concept  is  key  to  maintaining  readiness,  as  the Army is  unable  to  deploy  a  large  force  without the participation of the reserve components. The active Army, U.S. Army Reserve (USAR), Army National Guard (ARNG), and civilian workforce must work together to ensure  that  the  Army  can  meet  its  worldwide  missions.  Critical  skills of USAR and  ARNG  soldiers  have  placed  them  in  high  demand  for operational deployments in the post- Cold War era, particularly during FY 1996 and  1997  in  Bosnia. Integration of the  civilian workforce  into  the Total  Army  continues, and  their  role  is  expected  to  grow  in  the  future. Civilians, both Department of  the Army (DA) employees and contractors, have been needed in greater numbers for deployments and were essential in supporting U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Bosnia in FY 1997. To ensure that the  Total  Army's  personnel resources are managed efficiently and effectively, an integrated Total Army human resource management system was being developed during the :fiscal year.

The Army has recognized that human resource management is  more than  personnel  management and  includes  leadership, equal  opportunity, strength  management,  recruiting,  compensation  and  entitlements, career management, quality oflife, and budgeting.  The  same  changes in technology and society that  are  driving  the Force  XXI advanced war:fighting experiments (AWE) have resulted in a  new comprehensive approach to  managing the Army's personnel  resources.  To  recruit  the  highest quality soldiers  in  a marketplace increasingly competitive, the Army must maintain adequate compensation  and  quality  of life.  More  important,  however,  the  Army believes it must develop young soldiers into leaders and has developed the back-to-basics approach in Army values to reach this goal.

The traditional valuesloyalty, duty,  respect, selfless service, honor, integrity,  and  personal courageremain the same but are  being treated in  a  new  way. Offenses in  recent years caused the Army's  values and its ethical climate to be questioned and reviewed. In November 1995 General Dennis J.  Reimer, chief  of  staff  of  the Army (CSA), created the Character Development XXI initiative, a values baseline to establish an environment in  which Army members would do the right thing, treat others well, and

be  respected. In  the review process, the  Army learned that terminology and  definitions  of institutional  values  were  not  clearly  defined,  Army publications and documents provided conflicting meanings of values, and training  and  education  programs focused  on values with varying  levels of quality  and  emphasis. In  September  1996  General  Reimer approved the Character Development XXI concept, which  included initiatives and projects in  three categories:  doctrine and  policy, training and  education, and communications.

DuringFY I  997 theArmyworked to implement  Character  Development XXI. With respect to doctrine and policy, leadership doctrine was revised to establish  a common  framework  that  incorporated  the  traditional values,  which had  been  redefined. To  develop  leaders  whose  behaviors exemplified Army values, leadership traits were synchronized in the officer, noncommissioned officer, and civilian evaluation  reports. Additionally, a character development model  and an ethical climate assessment survey were created.  In the  realm of training and  education,  the Army revised the  curricula  of all  institutional  schools,  from  initial  entry  training  to the  Army  War  College,  to  incorporate  the  redefined  values,  character development concept, and history of the Army's heritage. Moreover, the Army  implemented the Consideration  for  Others program. To  increase Army awareness  of Character Development XXI,  the  Army  released  a video, Living Army VaLues, in  June  1997 and developed a synchronized communications plan. The basic doctrine to  reinforce the values baseline is contained  in Field Manual22- 100, Military Leadership.

Although  attracting  greater attention  in  recent years,  the  quantity  of personnel has  remained a major issue. Since  the  clrawdown  began  in FY 1989,  the  Army  has  decreased  its  size by  481,000 soldiers and  159,000 civilians, creating the smallest U.S. Army since World War II. As part of  the downsizing, more than 250,000 soldiers and civilians, with family members, were redeployed fi·om  Europe.  AI though the  Total  Army continued to decrease during  FY  . 1997,  the  process  slowed  considerably.  Personnel  reductions continued through reduced accessions and use of  voluntary programs such as  Voluntary  Early  Transition,  Voluntary  Separation  Incentive,  Special Separation Benefits, and Early  Retirement.  In  addition,  as  the  drawdown comes to an end, Army accessions are expected to stabilize.

The  1993  Bottom-Up  Review  recommended  that  the  active  Army reach a level of495,000 personnel by the end ofFY 1997; USAR reduced to 208,000 by FY 1998; ARNG decreased to 367,000 by FY 1997; and the decline in the number  of  civilians to 236,000 by FY  2001. The secretary of defense, using the Quadrennial Defense review (QDR) recommendations, directed  that the  active  Army decrease  its  size  by  an additional  15,000 personnel to 480,000 by FY 2003; the reserve  components by an additional 45,000 personnel to a combined total of  530,000; and the civilian force by

an additional33,700 to 202,300. To accomplish these objectives, the active Army in FY 1997 implemented a plan to reduce its force by 5,000 troops each year during FY  s  1997-1999 tlu· ough deactivations, consolidations, and the realignment of  headquarters and support facilities.  Of  the 45,000 reductions  directed  in  the  reserve  components,  USAR will  accomplish 3,000 in FY 2000, while ARNG will decrease its force by 5,000 persons in both FYs 1998 and  1999 and 7,000 in FY 2000. Total Army Analysis is a biCimial  process to determine the Army's force structure, and Total Army Analysis  2007  will  identify  in  1999  which positions will  be eliminated during FY 2001- 2002 and how the remaining 25,000 reserve component reductions  will  occur.  Before that analysis,  the active Army and  reserve components will work together to reconfigure USAR and ARNG units so that they mirror active units. A plan also was devised to reduce the civilian workforce by  17,000 individuals by FY 2006.

At the end of FY 1997, the active Army end strength was 491,700, close to  its QDR goal for FY 1997 of  490,000. USAR strength, 226,200 soldiers at the end of  FY  1996, continued to decrease during FY 1997 to 212,900. ARNG remained stable at 370,000 troops, the same number that had existed at the beginning of the fiscal  year.  Army civilians numbered 258,600 at the end ofFY 1996 and were reduced to 246,700 during FY 1997. At the end of  FY 1997, the Total Army consisted of  1,321 ,300 active Army, USAR, ARNG, and civilian members (Table 2).

The size of the active Army's officer corps continued to decline, but the number of  enlisted increased significantly, as shown in Table 3.

Expected changes in  future  demographics, however,  required slight increases  in  the  number  of spaces  programmed  to  accommodate  the annual  average  number  of trainees,  students,  and  other  soldiers  not assigned to operational units or organizations. To increase this figure, the

deputy chiefofstafffor operations and plans on 8 August 1997 ordered a decrease of  16,000 in the total number of  spaces authorized to operational units and organizations, which is termed  the Force Structure Allowance. The  CSA  approved  a  reduction  in  the  force  structure  of 5,000  in  FY 1997; 5,000 in FY 1998; and 6,000 in FY  1999. At the end of FY 1999, the active Army' s end strength of 480,000 will  consist of  419,000 Force Structure Allowance spaces and  61,000 Transient, Trainee, Holdee, and Student Allowance spaces.

*Numbers n1ay not add up owing to rounding

Despite the continued downsizing and the fears in some quarters that women  and minorities  would  be  affected  adversely,  the  percentages  of both within  the Army continued to  increase. Women had constituted  14.2 percent of the active Army  in  FY  1996  but increased to  14.8  percent of the active Army in FY 1997. Among commissioned officers, 14.2 percent were  female;  among warrant  officers,  6.3  percent;  and  among en listed soldiers,  15.1  percent. The representation of  women in FY  1997 in USAR was 24 percent of the  force;  in  ARNG, 9.3  percent; and, among  United States Military Academy (USMA) cadets, 14.2 percent.

Minorities had composed 38.6 percent of the active force in  FY 1996 and by the end of  FY 1997 had risen to 39.5 percent. Hispanics accounted for the ri.se in minority representation, as their percentage of  the force rose from 5.5  percent  in  FY  1996  to  6.5  percent  in  FY  1997. Nevertheless, Hispanics  remain  underrepresented  among  both  officers  and  enlisted members in  comparison with their representation  in  the U.S. population. The percentage of African Americans in the Army had declined slightly in  recent years owing to declining accessions of  African Americans in the

early  1990s, yet the percentage of  African American accessions continued to  exceed  the  percentage  of African  Americans  in  the  U.S.  population. In FY 1996, accessions of  African Americans  began to increase, returning  to  previous  levels  and  slowing  the  decline  in  the  percentage of  African Americans  in  the Army. Minorities composed  19.8 percent of commissioned officers, 24.7 percent of  warrant. officers, and 43.7 percent of  enlisted personnel. In other than the active Army, minorities constituted 35.2 percent of USAR, 25.7 percent of ARNG,  and  18.7 percent of the USMA cadets. The accessions of women and African Americans during fiscal  years  1995- 1997 are depicted in Table 4.

Table 4Accessions ofWomen and African Americans, Fiscal Years  1995- 1997

| Accessions                  | Fiscal Year 1995   | Fiscal Year 1996   | Fiscal Year 1997   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Total Number                | 62,93 1.0          | 73,418.0           | 83,469.0           |
| Female Percentage           | 18.9               | 20.3               | 19.7               |

African  Americans composed 26.8 percent  of  all soldiers; other  minority groups contributed 6.3  percent.  Of the  women  in  the  active  Army,  44.6 percent were white, 43.0 percent were African American, 5.7 percent were Hispanic, and 6.  7 percent were from other minority groups. Among enlisted women, Atl·ican  Americans constituted the largest group at  4  7 percent, while 39.8 percent were white. Of  all active Army men, 63.3 percent were white, 23.9 percent African American, 6.6 percent Hispanic, and 6.5 percent from other minorities. Within the commissioned officer corps, the composition was  ll percent African American, 3.5 percent Hispanic, 5.3 percent other minority groups, and 80.2 percent white. Warrant officers included a greater representation of  minority groups, with Afi'ican  Americans composing  15 percent;  Hispanics,  4.6  percent;  other  minority  groups,  5.1  percent;  and whites,  75.3  percent.  African  Americans  constituted  29.6  percent  of the enlisted ranks, while Hispanics formed 7.3 percent; other minority groups provided 6.8 percent, and whites contributed 56.3 percent.

The  Army  seeks  to  meet  three  objectives  in  attaining  its  military manpower  goals:  providing  quality  nonprior  service  (NPS)  accessions; retaining high-quality soldiers; and sustaining the right numbers, academic discipli nes, and grades of  active commissioned officers. Working hard to

retain  quality people,  the Army met its  retention  goals  in  every category in FY  1997. Although initial-term soldiers (those nearing the end of  their first  enlistment)  and  mid-career soldiers  reenlisted  at  rates  higher  than expected, the career soldiers (those at or nearing retirement eligibility) far surpassed the anticipated goal. The achievement of  retention goals for FY 1997 is shown in Table 5.

Table 5Achievement of  Retention Goals, Fiscal Year 1997

| Category   | Actual   | Goal   |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Initial    | 24,312   | 23,935 |
| Mid-Career | 30,209   | 29,699 |
| Career     | 25,043   | 23,981 |

Retention rates  improved  considerably from  82.8  percent in FY  1996 to  84.1  percent in FY  1997, increasing among commissioned officers from 89.9  to  90.5  percent,  respectively;  among  warrant  officers  from  89.6  to 91.2 percent, respectively; and among enlisted personnel from  81.4 to 82.8 percent, respectively. In every gender, race, and ethnic grouping, the highest retention  rate  was among warrant officers, except for white  males.  White females had the lowest retention rate of  any category of  soldier, except for those who were warrant officers, whereas white  males had the lowest retention rate of  all males, except for commissioned officers. The total retention rates of  blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups in FY 1997 were higher than those of  whites by several percentage points (Table 6).

Personnel  strength  is  an  impotiant  indication  of military  readiness,  but not all soldiers are capable of  deploying when necessary. The Army remained concerned about those individuals who were nondeployable, that is, unable to deploy to a specified area of  operation. Changing its evaluation process in FY 1997,  the Army decreased  significantly  its  nondeployability rate fi:om  nearly

4  percent  of the  force  to  3  percent.  The  percentage  of soldiers  considered permanently nondeployable remained negligible, while 3 percent were classified as temporarily nondeployable. Soldiers diagnosed with a  permanent medical limitation, such as being HIV-positive or having cancer, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, or any other progressive medical condition, were given assignment limitations and not assigned to deploying units. A soldier diagnosed after being assigned to a deploying unit was reassigned and replaced. Soldiers designated nondeployable  did  not  include  those  in  transient  status,  training,  long-term medical care, prison, or in the process of  separating from the service. Because an individual could be nondeployable for multiple reasons, the Army assigned priorities to different categories of  nondeployability and listed a soldier only in the highest-priority category applicable. Table 7 depicts the numbers  and categories of  nondeployable Army personnel for FY 1997.

Classifying soldiers who did not have a current Panorex (dental x-ray) in their files  as  deployable  decreased the number of nondeployables  by about 3,000 persons since FY 1996. Because most soldiers who  lacked a Panorex were men, this change reduced the percentage of  men considered as  nondeployable. The number of temporary administrative and  medical conditions that would render an  individual nondeployable also decreased for men.  An  additional 2,300 men were considered as deployable  in FY 1997 as compared with FY 1996, while the number ofwomen considered nondeployable in those categories remained about the same. Although the pregnancy rate for women rose in FY  1997 to 4.9 percent from 4.4 percent in FY  1996, the  rate remained below  the pregnancy rate of l 0.5  percent for women in the U.S. population. Nevertheless, the percentage of  women nondeployable  remained  much  higher  than  their  representation  in  the

active Army. During FY 1996, 9.5 percent of  all active Army women were nondeployable, while  the  rate  for  men  was  3 percent. The percentage of nondeployable women decreased in FY  J  997 to 8.7 percent, but remained much  higher  than  the  2  percent  recorded  for  men. Table  8 depicts  the changes in nondeployability rates during FYs 1996 and 1997.

Table 8Nondeployability Rates, Fiscal Years  1996 and 1997

| Nondeployables           | Men      | Women   | Total    |
|--------------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| FY96                     | 12,782.0 | 6,617.0 | 19,399.0 |
| Percent ofNondeployables | 65.9     | 34.0    | 100.0    |
| Percent ofActive Army    | 2.6      | 1.3     | 3.9      |

The rate  at  which  Army  personnel  are  deployed  away  from  their home  station  and  families  for  unit  and  personnel  training  or  military operations  is  known as personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO). The increase in unit  and individual deployments,  the  increase  in  joint  training exercises,  and  the  reduction-in-force  structure  continued  to  increase PERSTEMPO. The number of soldiers deployed  operationally on any given  day  in  FY  1997  averaged  31,316,  assigned  to  79  countries  and constituting 6 percent of the active Army.  In  addition,  120,000 soldiers remained stationed outside of the continental  United  States  (CONUS), a number  which  had  stabilized  after  the  drawdown  except  for  the personnel stationed in Bosnia. During FY 1997, PERSTEMPO was 180 days or more for personnel in U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), while the Army's goal  was  120  days.  By maximizing the  use  of simulations and simulators, as well as realigning the time spent training at home station versus  major  training  area  deployments,  the  Army  strove  to  reach  its PERSTEMPO goal. The Army  divided PERSTEMPO into deployment tempo  (DEPTEMPO)  and skill tempo  (SKILLTEMPO).  Although  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff  for Personnel (ODCSPER) acquired proponency for SKILLTEMPO, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations  retained  responsibility  for  the  overall  PERSTEMPO program.  DEPTEMPO  referred  to  the  amount  of time  units  spent  in overnight training  and  operational  deployments,  while  SKILLTEMPO referred to the time spent by individuals on operational deployments away from  home  station  by  MOS  (military occupational  specialty) and skill level. To  decrease PERSTEMPO, the Army initiated force management

options and, in particular, worked with the Department of  Defense (DOD) to  manage force requirements in response to contingency operations.

In  addition  to  operational  deployments,  the  deputy  chief of staff for personnel (DCSPER) authorized 18,724 permanent  changes of  station (PCS), costing about $192 million, in FY 1997. The authority to approve breaks in an assignment was delegated to the chiefs of  the Career Management Divisions in  ODCSPER. Division chiefs were given the authority to approve a break in a CONUS tour, as long as a service member had served at least twenty-four months in the assignment, and authority to curtail an overseas tour for up to ninety days before the  DEROS (date of  estimated return from  overseas). A f · unding shortage for approved PCS moves required an additional allocation of$7 million from the DCSPER. Within USAREUR, 400 operational moves with changes in DEROS were approved, while 100 operational moves with no change in DEROS were approved.

## Enlisted Personnel

Trends  in  enlistment propensity,  reported  annually  to  the president and Congress,  provide  an  important  tool  for  the  militaty services  in  predicting the future  demographics  of their service  members, adjusting their recruiting methods,  and  making  changes  to  the  military  lifestyle.  The  young  male's propensity to enlist in the Army decreased significantly fi"om  FY 1  991  to FY 1992 by 23.5 percent, and then remained stable at about 12 percent, while the young female's propensity to  enlist  remained  at  about 6 percent.  Recruiting young people, however, was made more difficult by a strong economy, higher college attendance, and increased  job opportunities in the civilian marketplace. Compared with FY 1996, the number of  persons age 16 to 21  who said in 1997 that they would  definitely join the Army decreased among African American and Hispanic males and females, rose among white males, and stayed the same for white females. Table 9 shows the most recent trends.

| Total            |                                 12 |                                11 |                                   6 |                                    5 |

Of those  individuals  who  said  they  would  join  the  Army,  one-third intended to  do so for  the educational funding for college that they  would receive. For one-fourth of the men and one-sixth of  the women, the catalyst to enlist was for the job training and  experience. A dislike  of the military lif estyle was the primary reason given by one-sixth of the men and one-fifth of the women who did not plan to join the Army. Of the rest who did not intend to enlist in the Army, their reasons were evenly divided among other career interests; family obligations; and perceptions that the military required too long a commitment, was against their beliefs, or was too dangerous.

Adding  to  these  recruiting  difficulties,  the  completion of the  post› Cold War drawdown required the Army to  reverse the policy of  decreased accessions  that  had  operated  through  FY  1996.  Reinstating  its  pre› drawdown policy of replacing  enlistment  losses one-for-one,  the service set  its  accession  requirement  for FY  1997  at 89,700  enlistments,  up  22 percent from actual enlistments in FY 1996. At the beginning ofFY 1997, only 31.2 percent of this goal, rather than an anticipated 35 percent, was met through the Delayed Entry program. In seeking to meet its recruiting challenge,  the  Army  assigned  more  recruiters,  increased  its  advertising budget and the enlistment bonus for some fields, and raised Army College Fund benefits. Even with all these efforts, however, only a fourth-quarter reduction of  seventy-seven hundred in the recruiting objective enabled the service to  consider the  recruiting year a success. Table  10 indicates  the increase in accessions for FYs  1995- 97.

Table  I  0Active Army Accessions, Fiscal Years 1995- 1997

|            | Fiscal Year 1995   | Fiscal Year 1996   | Fiscal Year 1997   |

| Accessions | 62,931             | 73,418             | 83,469             |

The active  Army  and  the  USAR  met  their  goals  for  the  quality  of their NPS accessions. The Army  imposed a goal on itself from FY  1991 through FY 1996 that at least 95 percent of its accessions would be high school graduates,  even  though  DOD's standard remained at 90  percent for each military service.  In FY J 997, owing to  recruiting difficulties, the Army  reduced  its goal  to  90 percent. Of the  FY  1997 active Army NPS accessions, 90 percent had high school diplomas, so the Army met its goal. The USAR attained 98  percent of its  accession  goal of 47,935, with 95 percent of  its NPS accessions possessing high school diplomas. Exceeding its accession goal of 59,262 soldiers, ARNG reported that, although only about 83 percent of  its NPS accessions held high school diplomas, another 17 percent achieved alternate diplomas after enlistment. The Army's  goals and accessions ofNPS recruits for FYs 1995- 97 are shown in Table  11.

To  maintain  the  highest  quality  of accessions  possible  in  FY  1997, the Army hoped  to  draw  67  percent of its  recruits fi·om  those  who  scored in the highest categories on the Army Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and to limit to 2 percent  of  its recruits those who scored in the lowest category. All Army components met the goal of  having 2 percent or fewer of their accessions scoring in the lowestASVAB category. ARNG continued to have difficulty meeting its goal for recruits scoring in the highest categories, while USAR's percentage in those categories dropped precipitously. Table 12 depicts the ASVAB goals and accessions for FYs 1995- 97.

*Scoring on the Army Services Vocational Aptitude Battery

Promoting  high-quality  soldiers  is  essential to maintaining  an appropriate grade structure in theAnny, as well as recognizing individuals capable of performing at the next higher grade. After promotion boards have selected the soldiers to  be promoted to the senior enlisted ranks of sergeant first class, master sergeant, and sergeant major, promotion lists are established. Each month, DA  identifies the  number of soldiers  from the lists that will be promoted within each MOS and grade. TheDA also selects  the  soldiers  to  be  promoted  in  the  ranks  of sergeant  and  staff sergeant, posts their names on the Total Army Data Base, and determines when each will be promoted based upon a competitive scoring system. During FY J  997, 52,604 enlisted soldiers were selected for promotion to or within the noncommissioned officer corps in the ranks of sergeant to sergeant major, representing  J  2.8  percent of the  total  enlisted  strength, a  substantial  increase  since  FY  1996  when  ll percent  of the  enlisted force was so promoted. Table 13 shows the number of  enlisted personnel promoted to each noncommissioned  officer rank during FY  s  1996 and 1997.

Because  unprogrammed  losses  were  expected  to  create  a  potential shortage in end strength, several reenlistment policy changes were made in FY 1997 to retain quality soldiers. The Army concentrated its efforts during the  second quarter of FY  1997 on  those soldiers whose ETS (estimated time of separation)  was  in  FY  1997.  Before  FY  1997,  a  soldier had  to reenlist within ninety days of  the ETS; this requirement was eliminated for those soldiers whose separation date was  in FY 1997. In another change, soldiers  who  reenlisted,  rather  than  being  required  to  move  to  another installation, were permitted to remain on the same installation as  long as they  were  reassigned  to  a  different  major command  (MACOM)  on that installation.  ln  addition,  soldiers  were  permitted to  reenlist up  to  twelve months before their ETS  as  opposed  to  eight  months,  allowing  them to make their decisions earlier.  In  the past, initial-term soldiers barred  tl·om

reenlisting had been allowed to request voluntary separation from the Army, but this option  was  eliminated in  FY  1997. Finally, the Army  lengthened the amount oftime that a soldier could serve on active duty without being promoted  to len years from  eight for the  rank of specialist and  to  fifteen years from  thirteen for the  rank of  sergeant.

Through  the  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  Program,  which is a monetary  incentive  offered to qualified  soldiers who  reenlist  in the Regular Army  for  continued duty  in  selected specialties, the Army aims to  increase  reenlistments  in  critical  MOSs that have  inadequate  strength levels  and  retention  levels.  Periodically,  the  Army  ana lyzes  each  MOS and  readjusts  the  list  of MOSs  for  which  bonus  monies  are  paid.  The Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program budget was increased from  $22.5 million  in  FY  1996 to $29.6 million in  FY  1997. This enabled the Army to offer bonuses for thirteen  new MOSs and  increase the entitlements for four  MOSs. At  the  end  of PY  1997,  the  /\rmy  was  offering a Selective Reenlistment  Bonus  for 22  combat,  3 I combat support,  and  25  combat service support MOSs.

Although the Army did not quite meet its goal of reenlisting 80,000 soldiers in FY  1997, it did reenlist 79,564 soldiers, achieving 99.5 percent of its goal.  The 24,312  initial-term and 30,209 mid-career soldiers who reenlisted  represented  a reenlistment  rate  that equaled  l  01.6 percent of the initial-term and  I  01.7 percent of  the mid-career goals.  The Army fell short of its  goal with  career soldiers, of whom  only 25,043  reenlisted, representing 95.1  percent of the goal.  Because of  enhanced advertising, the near  completion  of  the  drawdown, and concerned leadership, reenlistment rates have remained about  I  0 percent above historic levels, especially among  initial-term  soldiers.  Reenlistment  rates  among  mid› career soldiers returned  to  levels  that  existed  before  the drawdown.  As a  further  indication  of the quality  of  Army soldiers and  future  leaders, nearly  82  percent  of initial-term  soldiers  who  reenlisted  had  general technical scores  above I  00. The  reenlistment  rates for initial-term soldiers in  FYs  1 995- 97are given in Table  14.

| Reenlisted           | 19,960            | 21,107            | 24,312             |
| Reenlisted (Percent) | 45.6              | 45.5              | 53.2               |

To  maintain  the  right  mix  of specialties  and  ranks,  the  Army  had several  programs  designed  to  manage  losses  of its  enlisted  personnel.

During  FY  1997,  the Voluntary  Separation  Incentive  Program  was  not offered.  A  small  Early  Retirement  Program  provided  for  the  release  of I  ,OJ 5  enlisted  personnel based  on  their basic active service  date, grade, and, in  some cases, MOS.

Personnel  readiness  continued  to  be  affected  negatively  by  enlisted reassignment no-shows, soldiers who were expected to arrive at  gaining units in  response to published orders but  were sometimes deferred  or removed from the assigrunent.  Reducing  no-shows would . increase morale, improve the budgeting process, and enhance efficiency.  A new definition of  no-shows devised in FY J  996 improved personnel readiness reporting.  Rcassigrunent procedures at the installation level were tightened, and management reports tracking no-shows by name were created. The CSA tasked the commander of the  U.S. Total  Army Personnel  Commamd  (PERSCOM)  to  provide a quarterly  update  on  MACOM  and  installation  progress  in  reducing  no› shows.  As  a  result  of these  new  procedures,  quarterly  no-show  rates  in FY 1997 declined from 24 percent in the :first quarter to  18 percent in  the second, 15 percent in the third, and  13 percent in the fourth.  In August 1997 the CSA directed that the no-show goal for FY 1998 would be  I  0 percent, with a transition goal of 13 percent in the first quarter.

One of  the factors aff ecting reassignment no-shows was the Declination of  Continued Service Statement. Soldiers were required to receive counseling from the Personnel Service Battalion before their reenlistment date  to  help  them  decide  whether to  reenlist  or  leave  the  Army.  If the soldier decided to separate, a Declination of  Continued Service Statement was forwarded  by  the counselor to the commander. After the commander approved the statement, it was returned to the counselor, who forwarded it to the Personnel Service Battalion. This process took more than sixty days to  complete,  resulting  in  reassignment  no-shows  because soldiers  who were separating from  the service were still listed on orders  to  new  units. To streamline the process and  make it timelier, PERSCOM directed that new procedures be tested at Fort llood, Texas, during the second half of FY 1997. Career counselors became the approving authority for the statement, the processing time  was reduced to  five  working days, and reenlistments increased.  Moreover,  the  number  of no-shows  attributed  to  the  lack of a  timely  Declination  of Continued  Service  Statement  dropped  to  zero. The new procedures will  be  implemented  in all  CONUS  installations in October  1998.

When  soldiers  lose  their  skill qualifications  or  units  experience reorganization, shortages or excesses in particular MOSs  result, creating an  imbalance in  personnel resources. Reclassifying soldiers  is a  possibility  but  not  allowed  if a  soldier  is  not  qualified  for  the  new specialty, training is not available, the new MOS is full, the old MOS has a  shortage,  or  the soldier provided  an  incomplete  request.  In  addition,

the field  reclassification authority sometimes fails to perform eligibility processing. During FY  1997  a  total  of 3,621  reclassification  requests were  processed,  almost  half the  number  submitted  in  FY  1996,  with 66  percent of  them disapproved. About two- thirds  of the requests were voluntary.  The  system  used  for  reclassification  processing,  RETAIN, was  enhanced  in  FY  1997  using  feedback  from  the  field.  Voluntary reclassification  requests  could  be submitted electronically  via RETAIN to  PERSCOM,  with  decisions  provided  electronically  to  units.  This reduced the processing time for such requests from forty-five to ten days and  increased the percentage of  approvals.

## Officer  Personnel

Tto  improve  the  quality  of its  soldiers  and  their quality  of life,  the Officer Personnel  Management Directorate (OPMD)  revised  some of its procedures in FY  1997. It reduced the number of requisition cyclesthe periods in which it identified personnel to fill Army assignmentsfrom six to  four and  realigned the cycles throughout the year to decrease volatility in officer  assignments.  This created fewer mismatched  assignments and  reduced  the  amount  of turbulence  experienced  in the  officer corps. In  addition,  the  number of officers  required  to  relocate  during  the  non› sunm1er  decreased,  which  improved  the  morale  of families.  To  reduce the constant shortage of branch-qualified captains, OPMD decided  in FY 1997  to  decrease  the number of authorized  positions  in  which  they  were required, although this solution is stiLI  awaiting approval. In the meantime, OPMD studied life-cycle development, mission requirements, production, promotion potential, and the culture of  the Army to increase the number of branch-qualified captains.

Despite  its efforts,  the Army  experienced  a shortage of 995  officers in  FY  1997, a  larger deficiency  than  the  667 officers  it  was  short in FY 1996. The Army's end strength at the close of the fiscal year was 79,305, although it had  planned  to  reach a goal of 80,300  officers.  Of all  Army officers,  commissioned  officers  · composed  67,555,  short  of the  goal of 68,500  by  945;  warrant  officers  totaled  11,750,  fewer  than  the  goal  of 11,800  by  50  persons. The most significant  decreases  were  among  first lieutenants,  captains,  majors,  and  the  two  lowest warrant  officer  ranks, as junior officers  left the Army at rates higher than projected because of an  improved  civilian job market,  increased operational deployments, and multiple  assignments  overseas.  The  grade  distribution  of active  Army officers in FY  s  1996 and  L 97 is depicted in 9 Table 15.

Although the Army did  not meet its  goal for  the  number of officers in  the corps, it did exceed the number of planned accessions for officers. Table 16 indicates the number of  officer accessions required for a balanced corps and the number the Army actually acquired during FYs 1995- 97.

Fortheclassof200 I , USMA processed4,153 congressional nominations, almost 500 fewer than in FY  1996.  West Point proffered appointments to I ,676 candidates, and a class of  J,  196 cadets entered the institution in June 1997. The Reserve Officers  Training Corps'  Selection and Branching Board reviewed 3,814 cadet files and selected 3,259 for active duty, assigning each

to  a basic branch. Two selection boards chose 404 from the approximately I  ,005 soldiers who applied to attend Officer Candidate School.

A constrained budget precluded the convening of  any selection boards in  FY  1997 for the Call to Active Duty programs, another means by which the Army acquires officers. Any applicants possessing critical skills  were reviewed on an individual basis as exceptions to policy. The Army also has programs to  recall  soldiers from  retirement;  to  select individuals  to  serve on  the  Retiree  Council for five  days;  to  mobilize  Judge Advocate  Corps reservists for active  duty  tours;  and  to  bring reservists  to  active duty  for three  years  to  serve on the Physical  Disability Evaluation  Board.  Of the forty-nine  commissioned  officers  considered for  any  of these  programs, twenty-six  went on  active  duty  in  FY  1997, while eighteen of the  forty› four warrant officers whose records were reviewed were approved for active service.  Fifteen  officers  requested  interservice  transfersfour  into  and eleven out of the Army, with one and  four,  respectively, approved.  Nearly all  of the  applications  from  graduates  of other military academics  were approved for cross-commissioning in the Army. Three graduates of  the U.S. Air Force Academy, two from  the U.S. Naval Academy, and three from  the U.S.  Merchant Marine Academy entered as Army officers in FY 1997.

To  ensure  that Army  officers  were  promoted  on  a  fair  and  regular basis,  implementation  of the  Defense  Officer  Personnel  Management Act (DOPMA) continued during FY  1997.  Goals  for  selection  rate and length of  time for promotion in the basic branches were met, except for the selection rates to lieutenant colonel and colonel and the length of  time for promotion to  major. The officers in  the  year groups under consideration

for lieutenant colonel and colonel had  not been subjected to a drawdown, so the size of the year groups was larger than usual, and their promotion rates correspondingly decreased. Although the DOPMA goal for time until promotion  to  major was  not met,  the Army is expected  to  decrease  the length of  time for promotion to that grade over the next two or three years. The actual selection rates against the DOPMA goal and the length of  time in service for promotion versus the DOPMA goal are given in Table 18.

*Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act

One of  the Army's initiatives to ensure that a high quality of leadership exists  in  installation  management  is  a  centralized  selection  system  for garrison  commanders.  Command  selection  boards  now  select  garrison commanders in a process that makes these positions competitive with those of  troop commanders. To obtain trained and capable f"ltture garrison leaders, the Army Management Staff College has trained nearly 100 new garrison commanders in the garrison precommand course and nearly 40 installation commanders  in  the  general  officer  installation  course.  In  addition,  the CSA approved a pilot program, under the auspices of the assistant chief of  staff  for installation management for six garrison commanders to work with  local  city  managements  before  assuming  command.  Commanders at Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; and  Fort Lewis, Washi11gton, gained the opportunity to confront complex issues and acquire new tools.

To better manage the graduates from senior service colleges, the Army revised its assignment procedures during the year. More than eight hundred officers from  the Army, Navy, and Air Force Command and  General Staff colleges were slated to fill  branch-qualifying and other key Army positions in M  ACOM  s and Army agencies. In FY 1997, :fifty-two graduates from the Advanced Military Studies Program  were assigned to MACOMs in CONUS and overseas in accordance with Army guidance. OPMD developed a Senior

Service College Distribution Plan  for over 300 senior field-grade officers and  revised  its assignment procedures for former battalion  commanders. Officers stationed at Fort Hood were stabilized in their assignments to assist in the  March 1997 Advanced Warfighting Experiment.

Other  changes  in  PERSCOM were instituted to improve  officer personnel management.  In managing  the I 0,500  combat service support officers in  the Army,  OPMD significantly changed assignment options  for its  branch-qualified  captains as  a  result of the  drawdown. /\n  increasing number of  such officers were assigned as company commanders in the U.S. Army Recruiting Command or as assistant professors of military science at civilian  universities.  In  addition,  with  the dissolution  of the  Colonels' Division, branch chiefs became responsible for assigning colonels in their branches. Finally,  in late summer  1 997, OPMD developed an Assignment Officer's  Certification  Program that included mandatory automation  training, a  newcomer's orientation, and  an  ofT-site  training session  for  all  officers who had been assigned to PERSCOM for less than twelve months.

The officer evaluation report (OER) that had been in place for nineteen years  had  experienced  serious  inOation  over  the  years,  and  the  Army determined that a revision would improve officer personnel  management. In  FY  1996, employing feedback  from  officers,  the Army devised a new OER system  with  several  basic  elements: a  stronger support  form,  the tool  with  which officers list the contributions they have  made during the reporting period; a Junior Officer Development Support Form; a provision for  disregarding  OERs  of second  lieutenants  in  the  future;  improved administrative  and  rater  parts;  and  a  new  managed-profile  technique  to ensure that senior raters do not in· ftate reports. The CSA approved the new OER in March 1997 and directed its implementation beginning I October 1997. Six briefing teams traveled to 77 CONUS installations, 35 overseas installations,  and  87  organizations  in  the  National  Capital  Region  and briefed  45,000  officers  on  the  new  OER.  Although  the  teams  reported some anxiety about the new OER on  the part of officers in the  field,  the officer corps fully supported the  new  system.  In addition, a video and  a CD- ROM of the briefing were sent to all  brigades and separate battalions. ln August and September 1997 the /\rmy sent 110,000 copies of the new OER regulation and  forms,  with  an  instructional  guide,  to  o'fficcrs and installations.  Before  the new ORR was implemented, all  officers  had  the opportunity to receive a final  OER under the old system; and 56,000 such reports were created.

Congress  provided  another  means  for  improving  the  quality  of the officer corps. Recognizing that  military  operations  had  become joint in nature, Congress required each of  the military services to develop officers with an understanding of  other services and their role in joint operations. The  Goldwater-Nichols  Department  of Defense  Reorganization  Act  of

1986 made service in a  joint duty assignment (JDA) essential for a military officer to  be  promoted  to  general  or flag  officer rank.  An  officer  would be  designated  a joint specialty  officer  (JSO)  after  completion  of joint professional  military education  (JPME),  scheduled  in  two  phases,  and  a .IDA. Although DOD designated similar numbers ofJSOs in FYs  1996 and 1997,  the Army's number  in  FY  1 997202 of  DOD's 504rcprcsented a drop from  67 to 40 percent of  the total. But while the number of  officers designated  by  DOD  as  JSO  nominees dropped  precipitously  from  2,356 to  I,  760, the Army's  portion (563) remained about one-third. Of  the Army JSO nominees, 293 were designated as a result of  their critical occupational skills (COS) in Infantry, Armor, Artillery, Air Defense Artillery, Aviation, Special Operations, or Combat Engineers.

Of all  Anny  officers  in  FY 1997  with  a  COS,  I  ,582  officers  had completed JPME, which was slightly more than the  I  ,566 recorded for FY 1996. A total of I  ,059 officers with  a COS had  been designated  as JSOs; 2,122  had  been  named JSO nominees;  I  ,505  officers were JSO  nominees who had not completed JPME;  I  ,062 were JSO nominees serving in a JDA; and 6 were JSO  nominees who had completed a JDA and  were currently attending JPME. The number of  JSOs with COSs who had already served or  were  serving  in  a  second  joint  assignment  increased  from  FY  1996 to  FY  1997.  Of field-grade  officers,  198  had already served  in  a second joint assignment, of which  69  were critical joint positions, and  158 were currently serving in a second joint assignment, of  which 76 were identified as critical  joint positions. Nineteen general officers had already served in a second joint assignment, with  I  0 in a criticaljoint position, and  l2 general officers were currently serving in  a second joint assignment, with8  filling critical  joint positions.

After being designated .JSOs, Army officers in FY  1997 received first assignments as follows: 82  to  command  positions;  12  to  Headquarters, Department of the Army;  l  to  a critical Joint Staff position;  3  to  other Joint  Staff positions;  8 to  other critical JDA  positions;  29  to  other JDA positions;  4  to  PME  (professional  military  education)  positions;  25  to other operations; and 28 to other staffs.  For general  officers, the  length of a .J DA  tour averaged  25.5  months, while · field-grade officers remained  in their positions for an average of  33.7 months. In FY  1 997, nearly twice as many  officers  as  in FY  1996  were  unable  to  fulfi ll  the  normal  J  DA  tour length of 36 months  because of  a  new JDA assignment overseas, a COS reassignment, or retirement. A total of 1,004 officers were unable to serve 36 months in a .IDA assignment in FY J  997, compared with 516 officers in FY  1996. At the end of  FY  1996, 34.9 percent of  all  DOD JOA positions were filled  by 3,241  Army officers.

Because of the stringent criteria required to designate an  officer as a JSO,  waivers  were  often  needed  for  various  reasons.  The  I  ,393  waivers

awarded to field-grade officers  in FY 1  997 were significantly fewer than the 1,847 permitted in  FY 1996, while the  169 given to general officers in FY  1997 were almost equal to the  167 awarded in FY 1996. For departing a JDA position, 1,098 field-grade and 33 general officers received waivers, while another 76  fi.eld-grade  and  48 general officers  had  their minimum JDA tour lengths waived. An additional 202 field-grade officers received waivers  for  JSO  designation,  and 46  officers  received  waivers  because they were promoted to general officer rank. Of  the 270 Army officers who graduated from the JPME Phase II at the Armed Forces Staff College in FY 1997,20 percent had not completed the resident PMEPhase 1, while 20 percent had completed the nonresident PME Phase I. Promotion rates for joint officers remained much higher than  the board average for the Army competitive category  in FY  1997. For various types of assignments,  the FY  1997 active Army joint ofilcer promotion rates by rank are compared with the board average in Table  19.

Table  19Active Army Joint Officer Promotion Rates, Fiscal Year  1997

| Board Avera"e           |              49 |                   3 |        39 |                   60 | 74      |

Army  officers  who  served  in  the  Acquisition  Corps  were  also  a source  of special  attention.  DOD  continued  to  implement the  Defense Acquisition Workforce fmprovementAct(DAWIA) in FY 1997 in an effort to  improve  its  management of the  acquisition  workforce. The DAWIA permitted  only Acquisition  Corps  mernbers  to  hold  critical  acquisition positions  (CAP). A total of 5,304 CAPs in  the  Army  were occupied  by lieutenant colonels, colonels, general officers, and civilians in the grades ofGS- 14 and GS- 15 and in the Senior Executive Service. Civilians filled 4,549  of these CAPs,  &gt;vhile  military  personnel  served  in  755.  Systems planning, research, and development CAPs required  the skills of nearly half of the civilians, with 2,359 assigned. The greatest concentration of military  service  members,  463,  was  in  acquisition  management.  The number of personnel  in the  Acquisition  Corps  in  FY  1997  was  5,234, both  military and civilian, with  the  largest number working in  systems planning, research, development, and  engineering, and the  next highest grouping in program management.

As with JSOs, members of the Acquisition  Corps sometimes needed waivers to certain requirements. A total  of 504 received exceptions to the

educational requirements in FY 1997, with all but one granted on the basis of  the applicant possessing ten years of  acquisition experience, while one was granted for  passing an exam. During FY 1997 a total  of I  ,227 Army personnel participated  in  acquisition education, with  975  funded through the DOD Tuition Reimbursement Program and the remaining 252 serving as  interns. No individuals required certification by an Acquisition Career Program Board in FY 1997  in  lieu of a baccalaureate degree, continuing the Acquisition Corps pursuit of  excellence in its members.

Army  acquisition  program  managers  (PM)  were  required  to  serve minimum tour lengths, usually  four years, in a  manner similar to JSOs. During FY  1997  the average  length  of assignment for  PMs  was  thirty› eight months,  which did  not meet the Army's goal. Of the five PMs who were  reassigned  during  the  fiscal  year,  three  had  served  their  full  term and  two  had  not. The Army also granted  waivers or exceptions  to  other acquisition workforce personnel  in  FY  1997.  Of the  fifty-eight  granted, forty-n ine  were  for  humanitarian  reassignments  or  discharges,  and  the remainder  for  reassignment  in  the  government' s  interest,  promotion,  or selection to general officer.

During  FY  1996,  the  promotion  rate  for  Army  officers in the Acquisition Corps was consistently higher than in  the Army competitive category (all  Army officers except those who  belong to specialty corps), except to  the rank of lieutenant colonel.  Promotions to  lieutenant colonel in  the Acquisition Corps advanced beyond the Army competitive category rate  in FY 1997, but the  promotion rate to colonel for Acquisition Corps members dropped  considerably,  from  47.2  percent in  FY  1996  to  31.7 percent in  FY 1997, which was significantly below the Army competitive category rate of  42.2 percent. In addition, the differences in promotion rates for  general officers lessened from  FY  1996 to FY  1997. The promotion rates  of active Army  officers  in  the Acquisition  Corps and  in  the Army competitive category are in Table 20.

Table 20Active Army Officer Promotion Rates, Fiscal Year 1997

| Lieutenant Colonel |                          62.5 |                         59.9 |

## Civilian Personnel

The Total Army  relies on highly qualified and  motivated civilians to provide administrative,  logistical, and base support, particularly in  depot maintenance, supply,  acquisition, transportation,  training,  medical  care, research and development, engineering, and facilities programs, allowing military  forces to train  and  conduct  combat  operations.  Jn  addition, civilians  possess  many  critical  skills  often  needed  during  operational deployments. As the drawdown has taken place, civilian personnel working for  the  Army  have  acquired  a  greater  responsibility  in  contributing  to the Army's mission. To ensure that  the continued decrease  in  personnel did  not  negatively aiTcct efficiency and effectiveness, the Army Civilian Personnel  Administration/Management  Strategic  Plan for FYs 1997 and 1998  was  developed.  The  plan  provided  a  framework  for  creating programs,  policies,  automated  systems,  and  management  philosophies that would help lcaclers manage the civilian workforce better. ln addition, civilian workforce issues would be integrated more fully into the Army's planning  and  programming  process.  Civilian  personnel  systems  were being  redesigned  to  make  them  more  mission-oriented,  flexible,  cost› effective, results-oriented, and performance-based. Performance measures and objectives were established to assess programs already in place.

To develop  a civilian personnel system that will  support Force XXl and  the  Army  After  Next,  the  Civilian Personnel  Management  XXI concept plan  was  created.  Under  this  plan,  the Army  reviewed  civilian personnel  authorities and  requirements  to  determine  the  lowest  level  to which  they  could  be  delegated.  In  several  cases,  the  local  commander was delegated to exercise a particular authority and  was further permitted to  redelegate  all  or  part  of the  authority.  Local  commanders  would  be given authority to approve position classillcation without the requirement for  concurrent budget authority;  regularly  scheduled standby duty  pay; annual premium pay for excess administrative work; training agreements; advanced-in-hire rates; conversion of  positions to the competitive service; submission of waiver  requests  for air traffic  controllers;  and  reports  of Intergovernmental Personnel  Act  agreements.  MACOM  commanders would  receive  authority  to  approve  training  plans  and  agreements  for accelerated  promotions.  Civilian  Personnel  Management  XXI  will  be staffed formally during FY 1998.

The  civilian  workforce,  along  with  military  forces, has  declined steadily in numbers throughout the drawdown, dropping 37 percent during FYs  1989- 97. To  fulfill  the QDR requirement for the civilian  workforce to  reach  202,300, the Army planned in FY  1997 to reduce the number of civilians  by  6,000  persons  in  FY 1998;  8,000  in FY  1999;  and  another 8,000  in  FY  2000  to  reach  216,000,  a  47  percent  reduction  since  FY

1989. Accomplishing these reductions will  continue to  occur through the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and available separation  incentives. Fewer than 4,500 civilians have been involuntarily separated since FY 1989. The  Army  will  focus  on  outsourcing and  privatization  to  further  reduce the  number  of civilians  in  accordance  with  the  QDR.  Other  reductions have occurred through  transfer of functions  to  non-Army  organizations, downsizing, efficiency initiatives, base closures and consolidations, recngincering initiatives, and reevaluation of  workloads.

To adapt  to the decreased resources specified in the National Performance Review, DOD directed the military  services in November 1993 to  eliminate  full-service civilian  personnel  offices  on-site  and  to  switch to  a regionalized civilian personnel  service system by  FY  1999. Through this  process, the  number of personnel  supported by  each employee  in the civil  ian personnel field  wi ll increase to 88 in FY 1998 and to  I  00 after FY 200 I.  During  FY  1997, the  number of civilian  personnel administrative employees  decreased  from  4,624  to  4,365,  a  40  percent  decline  from 7,248  personnel in  FY  1990. The Army  redesigned  its civilian personnel offices to establish  regional civilian personnel operations centers (CPOC), achieving economies of  scale by providing services that did not require the physical presence of  clients. Small  staffs remained on-site to serve as patt of  a management team and advise commanders.

The  CPOC plan  was  devised  to  include seven  geographically  based regions  in  CONUS and three overseas. CPOCs in Seckenhcim, Germany (Europe  Region),  and  Fort  Belvoir (National Capital  Region)  were  fully operational  in  FY  1996, whi le those at Fort Benning (Southeast Region), Aberdeen  Proving  Ground  (Northeast  Region),  and  Fort  Riley,  Kansas (Southwest Region),  which  were  opened and  began  initial  operations  in FY  1996,  became fully  operational  in  FY  1997. Additional  CPOCs were opened  in  Tacgu,  South  Korea  (Korea  Region),  and  Fort  Richardson, Alaska  (Pacific  Region),  in  FY  1997  and  were  fully  operational  by  the end of  the fiscal year. Two CPOCs began initial operations in  FY J 997 at Rock Island Arsenal (North Central  Region) and Redstone Arsenal (South Central Region) and were scheduled to  be fully operational  by September 1998.  Fort Huachuca, Arizona (West Region), was selected  in September 1997 as  the  tenth  CPOC  location  and  will  begin  regionalized  operations in  March  1998.

Approximately 80 percent of  all  civilian personnel were being served by a regionalized CPOC at the end of  FY 1997. The reduction of  personnel specialist  positions and  the  requirement  to  regionalize  before automated systems  and tools were fully implemented  caused  some  problems, providing a poor perception of and adversely affecting customer service, but  the  Army  has  taken  steps  to  implement  corrective  action.  Because rcgionalization changed procedures that had been  in  place for filly years,

the Army dedicated significant resources  to  reassure customers, enhance the image ofCPOCs, eliminate backlogs, and improve services.  To oversee and  manage the daily operations of  all  CPOCs in CONUS and to provide guidance  for  all  CPOCs,  the  Army  established  the  U.S.  Army  Civilian Personnel  Operations Center  Management Agency  at Aberdeen Proving Ground in July 1997. The Army Center for Human Resource Management was  realigned  under  this  umbrella  organization.  In  addition,  the  Army chose to regionalize training for civilian personnel  administrators, establishing Classroom XXI facilities  with  the  latest  training equipment at each CPOC.

The Army continued to  provide programs  to develop  civilian  leaders. In  April  1997 DOD  established the Defense  Leadership and  Management Program. This new initiative is expected to prepare, certify, and continuously educate civilians to create a highly capable, diverse, and  mobile population of senior  leaders  who  can  work  throughout  DOD.  The  · first  competitive selection process tor entry into the program was announced in August 1997. In another initiative, the Army conducted a thorough assessment of  its Army civilian leadership training in FY  1997 with funding from the Office of  the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for  Manpower and  Reserve Affairs. The Training  and  Doctrine  Command  (TRADOC)  assessed  the  effectiveness of the Civilian  Common Core Leadership Training Program  by examining all  training  to  determine  whether correct competencies were  being taught and  to identify  gaps  or  areas  that  overlapped.  Upon  completion  of the study, TRADOC reported that, although civilian leadership training was an effective and progressive program, it required some improvement. A working group developed a strategy of short- and  long-term solutions to ensure the continued professional growth and development of  Army civilians.

Incorporating  the  newest  technology,  the  Army  made  extensive improvements  to Civilian Personnel On-Line,  a  worldwide  website dedicated to civil  ian personnel  administration. 1\ new Personnel Management Information  and  Support System provided a better search capability, while  a Civilian Personnel Regulatory Library offered regulations,  pamphlets,  policies,  and  guidance. The  site also  included a  rcgionalization  site  with  information  on  CPOCs  and  modernization issues.  To ease appl  ieation for training, the PY98 Cata!ogofArmy Civilian 7hrining,  Education,  and Professional Development Opportunities was posted  online,  with  the  required  forms.  The  inclusion  of a  vacancy announcement system allowed civilians immediate access to information on  available jobs  throughout  the  Army.  In  addition, the  Army  created an  Online  Position  Description  Library  that  consisted  of a  database of standardized  position  descriptions.  When  downloaded  and  used  in personnel  actions  without  being  edited,  these position descriptions reduced processing time. During FY  1997, sixty-four hundred position

descriptions  were  approved  for  use  throughout  the  Army  and  fifteen hundred more were awaiting MACOM approval.

Army  civilians  have  become  an  increasingly  important  element  in supporting  operational  deployments.  More  than  28,000  civilians  were stationed  in  other  countries  during  FY  1997.  On  any  given  day,  more than 600 were deployed in support of military operations on a worldwide basis.  Nevertheless,  the  number of civilians  providing direct support to military operations declined by 3,000 during FY 1997. Approximately two hundred civilians  deployed  in  support of Operation JOJNT  GUARD. At the same time, the demographics of  Army civilians changed from an average 43-year-old with  13.5 years of  service in FY 1989 to a 45.6-year-old with 16.2  years  of service  in  FY  1997.  Civilian personnel who  were eligible for retirement at the end ofFY 1996 numbered 14,369, or 6 percent of  the civilian workforce.

## Special Topics

The Army strives to ensure equal opportunity and fairness for soldiers and their families based on merit,  :fitness, capability, and  potential, regardless of race,  color,  gender,  national  origin,  or  religion,  and  to  provide  an environment free of  harassment. In securing this goal, the Army's primary challenge is  to place the required  number of  equal opportunity personnel in  the  field  and  to  restore  trust and  confidence  in  the equal opportunity system. Recognizing that discrimination negatively affects unit cohesion and  the  individual  soldier,  the  Army  developed  a  mandatory  command climate survey for company commanders so that they could more easily assess  the  equal  opportunity  environment within  their  units.  The Army has  also  developed  a  new  survey  tool that focuses  exclusively on equal opportunity.  In Army  programs. and  admjnistrative  tools,  the  Army  has emphasized leadership and training to improve equal opportunity.

To teach cadets how to become leaders who treat others with dignity and respect, USMA developed a human relations program called Respect for  Others.  The  Military  District  of Washington  (MDW)  adopted  the program  and  introduced  it  at  the  installation  level  as the  Consideration for  Others  program  in  early  1997.  In  April  1997  the  CSA  directed  that the  MDW  program be  used  as a  model and  implemented throughout the Army as a  component of Character Development XXI. The goal  of the program was to foster a positive command climate, eliminate all forms of harassment and  discrimination, and  develop a  more respectful culture  in which to work.

A revised Army regulation requires MACOMs to develop a training and development plan  for equal opportunity personnel and to place them on  the  personal sta-ff of commanders. The number of equal  opportunity

advisors, about 350  in  FY  1997, will  be increased  to  500 by  May  1999, and their rank will also be increased. The regulation further requires that interactive  training  on  the  prevention  of sexual  harassment  take  place in  small  groups  twice each  year  and  command  climate  assessments  be conducted annually and within  ninety  days  of a  change of  command.  In other changes, the regulation set  guidelines to eliminate or reduce reprisals against complainants, witnesses, and alleged perpetrators before, during, and after investigations.

The  Army periodically conducts a Sample Survey ofMilitary Personnel to track soldier attihtdes toward, and experiences with, discrimination and sexual  harassment.  While  24.9  percent  of all  female  soldiers  reported encountering  some  sexual  harassment  in  spring  1995,  this  percentage declined  to  21.4  in  spring  1997.  Of female  officers,  who  traditionally experience  fewer  episodes  of sexual  harassment  than  female  enlisted personnel,  17.1  percent reported  sexual  harassment  in  1995, while  only 10.9 percent did so in 1997. The percentage of  all female enlisted personnel reporting sexual harassment decreased from 26.4 in 1995 to 23.5 in  1997. The Army also  prepares  a  Military Equal  Opportunity Assessment  that evaluates  the  equal  opportunity  climate on a  yearly  basis,  covering  ten areas:  recruiting  and  accessions,  composition of the  force,  promotions, professional military education, separations, augmentation and  retention, assignments, discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, utilization of  skills, and discipline. Results from this annual assessment are provided to  senior Army  and  DOD  leaders. Tables  21 and 22 show  the  number of  sexual  harassment  and  equal  opportunity  discrimination  complaints, respectively, filed in the previous three calendar years and the number and percent of  complaints substantiated.

Members of Congress, particularly the Congressional  Black Caucus, arc  concerned  about  any  unfair  treatment  of minorities.  Their  frequent requests  for  demographic  data  on  Army  personnel  have  compelled  the Army to  track changes  in  minority  demographics  and  equal opportunity on an ongoing basis. In February  1 997 the Defense Manpower Data Center conducted  a survey among all military  personnel  on  race  relations  and equal  opportunity;  results,  however,  were  not  available  as  of the  end  of FY  1997.  The  Secretary  of the Army's Senior Review  Panel  on  Sexual llarassment  issued  recommendations  in  September  1997  to  strengthen equal  opportunity policies and  programs and to  improve human relations in  the Army.  In  that same month, the Army released its  Human  Relations Action  Plan,  which  detailed  the  tasks  it  would accomplish  to  implement the task force's recommendations.

When  the Army  removed  its restrictions  in  combat  aviation  in  1993, women gained an additional career field. A new rule in  1994 specified that women could serve in any position not expected to engage in direct ground combat; as a result, thirty-two thousand positions became  available to women. In  FY  1997, however,  women remained excluded from all  Infantry, Armor, Special Forces, and Ranger assignments, as well as some Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery positions.  During the fiscal year, the Army studied the issues of  whether to open to women positions in multiple launch rocket system units, in special operations aviation, as maneuver battalion S2s (intelligence officer),  and  as  command  sergeants  major to  general  officers,  but did  not make any changes. In FY 1997 the Army had one female lieutenant general, Claudia M.  Kennedy, and the first female command sergeant major to work for a three-star general. A female Army soldier also stood guard for the first time at the Tomb of  the Unknown Soldier.

In an ciTort to prevent  Army members from demonstrating racist, sexist, or extremist beliefs, the Army has identified certain tattoos as  prohibited. In  Army  Regulation  670- 1, Wear  and Appearance  of  Army  Uniforms and Insignia, tattoos  that  arc  exposed  while  in  Class A uniform  or that would  detract  from  a  soldierly  appearance  are  not authorized.  In  Army Regulation 40- 50 I, Standards ofMedical Fitness, tattoos that wOLlldlimit effective  performance of military service are a cause  to  reject applicants tor  mi litary  service.  Within  these  li mitations,  soldiers  arc  permitted  to display tattoos on exposed skin while wearing Class B or utility uniforms. Army Regulation 670- 1, however, is being revised to  prohibit tattoos that arc offensive, vulgar, profane, sexist, gang-related, or racist, regardless of where they are located on the body. Army recruiters evaluated questionable tattoos  worn  by  494  applicants  in  FY  1997  and  rejected  60  individuals for  military  service.  At  Fort  Benning,  Georgia,  the  only  training  center to  separate soldiers  from  the  service  for  illegal  or  objectionable  tattoos, sixteen  soldiers  were  dismissed  from  the Army  in  FY  1997.  In  August

1997 a Process Action Team  was  formed  at the direction  of the  CSA to review uniform issues, including tattoos.

The Army worked in FY 1997 to eliminate perceived discrimination in other areas. On the basis of  a rev iew of  scientific evidence and conferences with military and civilian  research psychologists, the Army decided in  FY 1997 to revise the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) standards. Minimum requirements to  pass the APFT would be based on  persons who scored at the  I  Oth percentile in a study in  1 996, while scores required to achieve the highest rating would be based on those in the study who had scored at the 90th percentile. TheArmy'sgoal  was toestablishgenderequityon theAPFT, in  response to male soldiers who, for the tv.relve years'  duration of  the old standards,  had complained that the standards for male and female soldiers were different and,  therefore, not equal.  Although scientific evidence  had long demonstrated that the average female was not capable of performing to the same physical standards as the average male, the Army believed that women  in  the  1980s  had  improved their  physical capabi  litics and  could now perform to a higher standard.  13y raising the standards for women on the  APFT,  the Army planned  to  decrease  the differences  in  standards for males and females, reflecting an equal effort by both genders.

The  number of sit-ups  required  by  males  and  females  would  be  the same, with no differentiation in number based on gender. Women, who had been  permitted  longer periods of  time  in  which to  complete the two-mile run  and who could obtain a maximum score  by  running slower than  many men, would  now be  required to  run  the  event  in  the same  time.  Female soldiers,  however, would  not  be  required  to  complete  as  many  push-ups to  achieve  the  highest score,  as  the  1 984  standards  were  not  established scientifically.  ln  the  new APFT,  minimum  standards for  the two  youngest age groups would not be relaxed, while new age groups would be established for  those  who  were 26-52 years old, 57- 61 years  old, and  more  than  62 years  old.  "Fail,  pass,  badge,  and  max"  would  remain  the  identifiers  for an  individual's performance on the APFT. The Army also planned to relax selected  maximum  scores  to  enable  the  top  10  percent  of the  Army  to receive a Physical Training badgethose who scored a total of  285 points out oDOO in three events and at least 90 on each event. To continue wearing the badge, a soldier must attain a similar score on each subsequent test. The Army has established a training period of one-quarter before the  first  new APFT is given for women to reach the more difficult standards.

Another  special  group  that  requires  Army  attention  is  the  military retiree community.  The  Army  Retiree  Council meets  once  yearly  to discuss issues of  concern to the retiree community and  reports on them to the CSA. The 37th meeting in  1997 was preoccupied with retiree military health  care, which remained the greatest concern for all  military retirees. On  the basis  of the promise of long-term  medical  care  that  the  military

has long used to recruit and retain soldiers, the council asked that military retirees, who shouldered the heaviest and most dangerous burdens of the nation's  defense, receive the same lifetime health care provided to civilian retirees.  The Military  Medical  Benefits Amendments  of 1966  authorize health  care for  military  retirees,  dependents,  and  survivors  for  whom a military treatment facility (MTF) is  not available. The council noted that one-third  of the  Military  Health  Service  System  had  been  eliminated during  the  drawdown,  with 58  military  hospitals closed and another  17 scheduled to be reduced to clinics in FY 1998.

Nearly all of  the council's requests dealt with TRICARE: reduce the catastrophiccapto$3,000from$7,500;permitTRICAREPrimeenrolleesto receive care in different regions; extend  TRICARE Prime beyond an MTF's catchment area  (servicing area);  raise  reimbursement  rates  and  provide timely  reimbursements to  attract quality  health care  providers;  eliminate the requirement for all providers to file claims for beneficiaries to reduce the  number of providers  refusing  to  accept TRICARE Standard; require Medicare  providers  to  accept TRICARE  Standard;  provide  TRICARE Prime to all beneficiaries over 65 living in an MTF catchment area; permit retirees outside of a catchment area to join the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; and expand the DOD mail order pharmacy program to include all retiree beneficiaries. In addition, the council requested that the nonappropriated dental  plan  being implemented on  1 October  1997  for military retirees be improved and that retirement services at installations receive continued funding and support.

## Force Development

## Blueprint  for the Future

There were two major influences on /\rmy force structure in FY 1997. First, the Army made great strides  in  Force XXI, the process intended to transform  the Army into a  technologically superior force  that would  use the most advanced systems to attain information dominance, a key pillar of success  on  the  future  battlefield.  Second,  the  Quadrennial  Defense Review (QDR) undertook a comprehensive review of active and reserve component Army forces.

The processes  associated  with  the  Force  XXl  Campaign  and  the Army After Next (AAN) have  produced new concepts of land  warfare that will have radical implications for the Army's  organization, structure, operations,  and  sustainment.  The  dcployability  and  sustainability  of this  future  force  will  be enhanced  by  equipment that  is  lighter,  more durable, and  more easily  maintainable.  Decisive  operations will  result from the development and widespread employment of new information technologies  that  will  provide  all  elements  of the  force  a  common operational  picture.  Protection  of the  force will  be  improved  by  these same information teclmologies; and  the resulting common operational picture  will  include  new,  more  sophisticated  sensors  and  platforms; quicker, more capable intelligence processors; and warflghting systems that are easier to employ. To enable the conduct of  operations across the operational  spectrum  an9  to  reduce  lift  requirements, Army  units are being made more flexible and modular to permit more tailorable force packaging. To realize the visions of  Force XXf and the AAN, the /\rmy has  focused  its efforts  on  providing  soldiers and  combat systems with information  teclu1ology  and  other enhancements  while pursuing  long› term  research  on,  and  development of,  successor technologies  for  the future force.

In support of  the firstAAN annual cycle, The Army Materiel Command (AMC)  initiated  and  conducted  a  number  of activities.  The  command created a technology team to provide technical advice during the winter war game in January and February. In addition, AMC organized integrated idea

teams, or multidisciplinary groups of  technologists to evaluate  innovative concepts,  and  convened  a  team  on  tactical  and  operational  mobility. AMC also sponsored a  technology workshop  in  March  to  study robotic applications in mid- to  high-intensity  operations and  military operations in  urban terrain; conducted a study offuel efficiency and alternatives and presented  its  findings  in  a white paper for the chief of staff of the Army (CSA); and established  the Army Technology and Concepts Network, an Internet-based electronic network for the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and AMC to use in collaborating with the national science and technology community. AMC is partnering with TRADOC, the assistant secretary  of the  Army  for  research,  development,  and  acquisition,  and the Office of the Deputy Chief  of Staff for Operations and Plans to align technology-based investments to support the AAN.

The first annual  cycle of the AAN concluded with a capstone report, Knowledge and Speed, signed by the CSA on 1 August 1997. This report focuses on probable geopolitical realities, evolving military art  and science, human and organizational behavior issues, and technology.

The  QDR  reaffirmed  the  need  for  ten  active  Army  divisions  to execute two  nearly simultaneous major-theater wars with  moderate risks and suggested that force reductions could lead to a reduction in overseas presence and forward  deployments. Although the QDR, having analyzed the  capabilities  of U.S.  forces  to  fight and  win  on  the Korean peninsula and in Southwest Asia in 2006, determined that the current military force structure was adequate, it  also stated that a larger force would be necessary if the enemy uses  chemical weapons or shorter warning times occur.  At the  same  time,  the  multiple  smaller-scale  contingency  operations  that U.S.  forces  have been required to conduct in the 1990s have increased the operational deployment of  military units. The demand has not been limited to  types  of units,  which  are  few  in  the  force  structure,  but  has  affected more common types of units as  well, particularly headquarters elements that have been tasked more heavily than their subordinates.

Digitization  is  the  means  by  which  the  Army  expects  to  achieve information dominance, which is a necessity .for the future smaller Army to obtain battlefield dominance. The Army Digitization Office  integrates technology and digital communications from the sustaining base to tactical and  strategic  levels; identifies programming  requirements;  evaluates digitization  efforts;  and works  closely  with other services  and  coalition partners to ensure interoperability. Through modern communications and computers, digitization is providing commanders, planners, and operators of combat  weapons  systems  the  ability  to  rapidly  acquire  and  share information.  Combat  operations  are  being  revolutionized  as  improved awareness of  the battlefield environment drastically changes the operating tempo and the manner in which battles are conducted.

For Army  XXI  to  be  an  information-based  force,  the  Army  must maintain the technological edge not only in weapons systems, but also in its capability to  communicate and exchange  information. To  ensure that all  systems  possess interoperable  information technologies,  the Army is upgrading or modifying current systems and setting new requirements for future systems. Once digitization is complete, command and control will be integrated fully and  extend from  the strategic level to the soldier in a foxhole, with battlefield information shared simultaneously at all levels in near real time. Digitization will resu lt in a more synchronized force, a more rapid and effective decision-making capability and a reduction in logistics stockpiles  at  port  facilities  that  will  enable  a  commander  to  maintain initiative and  momentum once engaged with the enemy. fn addition, with each  tank,  helicopter,  support vehicle,  and soldier possessing access  to immediate, two-way  battlefield  information, confusion  will diminish and the potential for fratricide will decrease.

Full-spectrum  dominance, the  shared goal  of Army  Vision 2010 and Joint Vision 2010, will  be accomplished partially by increasing the effectiveness of light forces and reducing heavy-lift requirements. At the same time, the Army is inserting technology and conducting recapitalization to extend the lif e of  existing systems. A focus on technological advances will enable the Army to determine what capabilities will  be needed for the AAN  and  to develop the leap-ahead capabilities that will  be required for full-spectrum dominance in the future. One effort to increase the Army's  mobility involves improving lethality so  that "one roundone  kill"  becomes a  reality  and reduces the logistics burden imposed by ammunition resupply. Autonomous platforms will  play  a  central  ro le  in  the AAN,  decreasing the  number of operators required and permitting operations in high-risk environments.

The US. Space Command Vision 2020 recognizes challenges for space and missile defense in trying to achieve full-spectrum dominance. National missile defense had been regarded as a technology readiness program but was recently redesignated as a deployment readiness program, increasing the priority of  space and missile defense as an element of  national defense. The Space and Missle Defense Command's (SMDC)  participation in AAN warfighting games showed not only  that battlefield  success  will  rely  on space  operations  in  2020  but  also  that,  at  times,  space  operations  will determine the outcome. During the 1997 AAN winter war game, the space reconnaissance  and  counter-reconnaissance  battles  were  recognized  as critical for national  victory.  Prominent issues  that have emerged include space control, space policy, space reliability, and space vulnerability.

Space-based  systems  will affect  the  future of  arfare  by providing  another w dimension for  the  battlefield.  The  Army's approach  to  communications, command  and control, and geopositioning systemsand nullifying enemy  attempts  at countering  themwill  be  influenced  by  space-based

communications systems, as well as research and development, available in the commercial sector. The most recent achievements include antisatellite technologies,  laser destruction  of  short-range  rockets,  and fielding  of the joint  tactical ground station. Providing space support and institutionalizing it in tactical operations has gained increased emphasis. Tactical space-support soldiers  have  deployed  to  crises  and  contingency  operations,  including Operation JOINT GuARD, to provide  space  capabilities  to warfighting commanders and  to  provide  training  to  joint warfighters.  Space-support teams  ensure that Army forces  have  access  to,  among other capabilities, enhanced global communications, multispectral imagery, and small weather receivers. In addition, they complement the  Tactical Exploitation ofNational Capabilities Program  by bringing intelligence products from  national  and theater sources directly to the tactical commander.

Information  dominance  relies  upon  space-based  systems  and  space products, particularly satellite systems. Among the military services, the Army is  the  largest consumer of space products. As  a  result, situational awareness on  the  battlefield  has  improved  vastly;  telemedicine has  been expanded to soldiers  in a combat zone; movement of supplies and assets into a theater is better managed; and a variety of  operations at high tempo can be maintained. To  be effective on the ground in future wars, the Army must have up-to-date space products, including weather forecasts, logistics management and tracking, precision navigational aids,  multispectral and hyperspectral terrain analysis and mapping, and missile launch warning and sensor cueing. To ensure that these products are available in the future, the Army provides input into  the development of  future space-based systems. The  Army is acquiring 700,000 GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers, which will be installed on precision-guided munitions, weapons platforms, and vehicles. Strategic reconnaissance will  be essential for planning and conducting deployment, lodgment, deception, and information operations for the force-projection army.

Space and Missile  Defense  Command Vision  2010 posits that space and  missile  defense  will  be  the  defining  factor  in future  war,  requiring increased national emphasis. SMDC plans to provide the  best space and missile defense capabilities and field them to the joint warfighter as rapidly as possible. In working towards fu ll-spectrum dominance, SMDC signed a memorandum of  agreement in February 1997 with TRADOC that assigned proponency for specified Army space and national missile defense issues to  SMDC.  SMDC  is  responsible  for  integrating  space  doctrine  with training, leader development, organization, materiel, and soldier solutions throughout the Army and within appropriate  joint  agencies. Within SMDC, the Force Development and Integration  Center works  with TRADOC to develop space and missile defense operational concepts and requirements and then field  them for testing.

SMDC was also authorized to establish a Space and Missile Defense BattleLaboratory(SMDBL)toplanandconductmissiledefensewarfighting experiments, as well as emphasize advanced technology development. In conjunction  with  SMDBL and  the  Force  Development  and  Integration Center,  the  SMDC  Space Technology  Integration  Office  is  developing and executing a long-range research and development program based on future  space  warfighting  concepts  and  related  operational  capabilities. SMDC was  also designated  as  the Army's primary  point of contact for national  missile  defense,  providing  the Army  with  a  lieutenant general, the  SMDC commander, to  speak  on  its  behalf with The Department of Defense (DOD).

## Force Development

After a reduction of  two active Army divisions in FY 1996, the number of divisions remained stable in FY 1997, with ten active and eight Army National Guard (ARNG) divisions in the force structure. ARNG separate brigades, which had declined from 24 to 22 by FY  1996, were reduced in FY 1997 to  18. In addition,  the active Army retained five Special Forces groups and the  Ranger Regiment,  while ARNG  maintained two Special Forces groups.

Under  the  guidance  of the deputy  chief of staff for operations  and plans, the Army in FY 1997 completed the biennial Total Army Analysis 2005  process,  designed  to develop  the force structure necessary to meet two  nearly  simultaneous  major-theater  wars.  In  addition  to  providing greater precision and clarity for the force structure anticipated for 2005, the process also improved procedures that will help determine future force structure  requirements.  The  Total  Army  warfighting  requirement  was recalculated, and allocation rules were updated.

A  significant  part  of  the  Force  XXI  process  includes  advanced warfighting experiments (AWE), providing the opportunity for soldiers to develop and test new equipment.  Since May  1994 six AWEs  have  been conducted. The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), located at Fort Hood, Texas, was designated as the Army's  Experimental Force (EXFOR) to test innovations in Force XXI. The EXFOR 1st Brigade Task Force, composed of  a tank battalion and mechanized battalion from the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and a light infantry battalion from the 25th Infantry Division (Light), formed Task Force XXI. Preparations for the Task Force XXI AWE began in June 1996, and it was conducted at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California, froml6 to 29 March 1997.

The  Task  Force  XXI  AWE  was  the  largest  and  most  significant experiment in Army history.  In  a massive and complex operation at Fort Hood,  the  Army  installed  and  jntegrated  nearly  5,000  pieces  of new

equipment, including  I  ,200 applique (add-on) computers, on  or in nearly 1,000 vehicles of  all  types  in the brigade task force inventory. During the fiscal year, the EXFOR trained more than 2,600 soldiers on a wide variety of equipment at all  levels. Field exercises were conducted  at the squad, platoon,  company,  battalion,  and  brigade  task  force  levels,  providing a  tremendous  amount of data  and  new  insights.  In  December  1996 the 1st  Brigade  participated  in  an  opposing  forces  exercise  at  Fort  Hood that  involved  5,000  soldiers  and  included  three  offensive  missions,  two defensive missions, and one future scenario. The exercise demonstrated that the applique computers worked well at all  levels and provided continuous, enhanced  situational  awareness  of the  battlefield  through  information obtained from the brigade reconnaissance troop, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),  the  OH- 58D  Kiowa  Warrior,  the  Joint  Surveillance  and Target Attack Radar System, and the All-Source Analysis System.

T  n late February 1997 the brigade task force was loaded onto trains and deployed to NTC, arriving in early March. NTC Rotation 97- 06 involved 5,000 soldiers,  1,200 contractors, and  1,400 vehicles that engaged in two weeks of exercises involving traditional and anticipated future  missions. As a digitized heavy force, Task Force XXI was designed to evaluate new systems,  equipment,  operational concepts, organizational designs, advanced technologies,  doctrine,  and  tactics  during  realistic  combat  operations against a highly competent opposing force in the AWE. More than seventy items  or processes were tested.  Information collected during the AWE  is now  being analyzed  by TRADOC and will  assist  the Army  in  defining specific  requirements  in  implementing Army  XXI.  The  performance  of equipment and soldiers represented a revolution in digitization.

One of the most important outcomes of  AWE was a  vastly improved situational awareness of  the battkfield. At the same time, the Army learned that not everyone needed the same battlefield information simultaneously. The tactical  Internet coupled  the  Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) and Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS),  enabling  every  platform  to  transmit  its  positional  and command-and-control  data to all  other battlefield elements. The applique computers provided a visual representation of  the battlefield, with a further advantage  that  voice  communications  remained  free  from  traditional transmissions  about unit  locations.  Commanders  from  p latoon  through division level were able to  identify,  with precision, the battlefield positions of  their unit, friendly forces, and enemy forces, enabling a more rapid and exact projection of combat power,  a  better integration of heavy and light forces,  and  a  quicker  redeployment of logistics.  Although sensors could detect enemy forces without difficulty, the AWE demonstrated that fusing the information from multiple sources presented a challenge that the Army is currently working to overcome. Recognizing that leaders must be taught

how to  use  information obtained from  the digitized battlefield,  the Army is  revamping its curricula at training institutions to ensure that training in information management and digitization is provided.

The quality of  maintenance that resulted from allowing contractors on the battlefield to maintain  their  equipment  led  to impressive performances of equipment prototypes and a reexamination of  the future role of  contractors on the battlefield.  Of the equipment used, 85  percent provided significant contributions to combat operations,  10 percent required additional  work, and 5 percent did not work at all. The UAVs were particularly successful in  their reconnaissance role, allowing commanders to  gain and maintain contact with the enemy and forcing the enemy to change its battle rhythms. Providing  early  warning,  the  air  defense  artillery  architecture  enabled the task  force  to  shoot  down  81  percent of all  incoming enemy aircraft. Expectations were exceeded by the AH- 64 Longbow Apache, which used advanced systems  to  validate  enemy  locations  and  maintain  situational awareness, and the Al-l- 64D Apache, which exhibited increased  levels of lethality and survivability. With only half  of more than sixty new manuals discovered  to  be  useful,  the Army  is  currently engaged  in  rewriting  the documents.  Lack  of confidence  in  logistics  support  occurred  because maneuver  commanders  were  encumbered  with  planning  or  executing combat  service  support  for  their  units.  The  AWE  identified  logistics situation  reports  as  needing  improvement  and  total  asset  v isibility  as vital for battlefield success. In  addition, Task Force XXl helped the Army identify eleven  items of equipment or technology to  purchase under the Warfighting Rapid Acquisition Program.

With the results from Task  Force XXl AWE and follow-on experiments, the  Army  will  determine  future  force  structure,  materiel  requirements, organization,  training,  leader  development,  and  doctrine.  The  center  of the Army's digitization efforts resides in lil Corps, with the 4th  Infantry Division set to  emerge as  the first  interim digitized division  and  the  1st Cavalry Division as the second. Although the Army had planned to digitize III  Corps by 2006, the digitized corps will  be fielded  two years earlier, in 2004. Many of  the digitization systems already exist or will be fielded to the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) as part of the normal modernization process. These  include  SINCGARS,  EPLRS,  Army  Tactical  Command and  Control  System  (ATCCS),  the  MlA2 Abrams tank,  and the M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

Since March 1997 the Army has engaged in Division XXI, an AWE to finalize  the architecture for the first digitized division, and will  announce the  results  . in  February  1998.  Under  the  Division  XXI AWE,  testing  of the  interim  divisional  design  and  operational  concept,  battle  command information  requirements,  and  combat support  concepts  began  in  June 1997.  TheA  WE will culminate  9- 13 November 1997 with the Division XXI

BCTP (Battle  Command Training  Program),  a  multiechelon,  integrated experiment emphasizing division-level battle c01mnand and incorporating command post simulation  tools  developed at Fort Leavenworth  to  train senior leaders. In addition to  developing the Force XXI Battle Command and  Information  Operations  requirement,  the AWE  is  also  expected  to determine operational requirements for Division XXI operations.

The centerpiece of  the Army's effort to digitize the force is the Force XXI  Battle  Command  Brigade  and  Below  (FBCB2)  initiative,  a  key coinponent  of the  Army  Battle  Command  System  that  interfaces  with ATCCS at the  brigade and battalion level.  The contract for FBCB2 was awarded  in  January  1995,  and  the  system was  fielded  in  February  1997 to  Task Force  XXI.  Computers capable of displaying digital maps, with icons representing vehicles moving in near real time across the battlefield, will  provide  situational  awareness  without  the  requirement for  soldiers to  enter  data.  The  system  includes four  basic  computers:  a  commercial laptop  version,  a  ruggedized  version (able  to  withstand  heavy  wear  and tear), a militarized version, and the Dismounted Soldier System Unit. The fi rst three are vehicle mounted; the fourth can be carried by the individual soldier. All members of  a unit or team will have access to the same data.

The  FBCB2  system  consists  of  hardware  devices  and  software programming.  fn  one form of  installation, standard software is embedded or built  into  modern  computers  located  on the Army's newest vehicles, such as the MlA2 Abrams tank and the M2A3 Bradley. In the other form, stand-alone installation, a set of  hardware devicesincluding a computer, digital  radios, GPS receiver, and mounting equipmentis  added to sixty different types of Army  vehicles.  Ten  percent of all Army vehicles  will have  the  embedded  installation,  while  90  percent  will  have  the  stand› alone installation. Although the software is standard, it is produced in two segments. Both types ofFBCB2 installation possess the back-end segment of  the software, which  includes the capability for messages, algorithms, and vehicle-to-vehicle interface. The front-end segment of  the software, which includes the map and graphic display capability, is used only in the stand› alone  installation;  vehicles  with  embedded  installation  of FBCB2  must have additional software for performing the front-end role. The Embedded Battle Command,  which  provides  the software  for situational  awareness and command and control in vehicles with the embedded installation, will receive additional front-end software in the futme.

In  an  initiative  to  accelerate  the  combat  development  process, .the Army has established battle  laboratories where operational requirements can  be determined  more  quickly  through  warfighting  experiments. The battle laboratoriesMounted Maneuver, Dismounted Battle Space, Depth and  Simultaneous  Attack,  Battle  Command,  Combat  Service  Support, Maneuver Support,  Air  Maneuver,  and  Space  and  Missileprovide  an

opportunity for  military users and developers of  military equipment  to study science and technology and focus research on warfighting priorities.

## Training

In  1973  the  U.S.  Army  began  to  reexamine  its  warfighting doctrine and institute changes  through  new  training  processes.  This  training revolution  was  propelled  by  the  creation  of  TRADOC  in  July  1973  and motivated by lessons learned from the Arab-Israeli War in October 1973. The Army  developed  performance-oriented  training,  the  plan-prepare› execute-assess-retrain methodology, capstone doctrinal training manuals, standardized training, and combat training centers (CTC). The inclusion of highly  trained  observer-controllers,  an  after-action  review  process, and  the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System greatly  improved live exercises.  In addition,  other large-scale exercises  were conducted  in the Army's effort to meet the challenge of  fighting and winning against a numerically superior military force.

The  Army  trains  in  three  modes  of simulation:  live,  virtual,  and constructive  simulation.  Soldiers  deploy  to  the  field, train on  actual equipment,  and  are exposed  to  weather and  terrain  in  live  training,  the results  of which  are  assessed  through  simulation.  In  virtual  training, individuals, crews, and units train  on systems that replicate their combat systems, such as aircraft flight simulators. Constructive simulation displays units  and  equipment as  icons  on  a  computer  screen.  New technologies have  permitted  realism  in live  trainjng,  while  virtual  simulators  have allowed units to train without firing tank rounds and before deploying for live exercises. With the rapid growth in computer-based battle simulations, constructive  simulation  has  proven  the  most cost-effective  way  to  train commanders and their staffs. In addition, a thorough examination of  Army training methodology is occurring to find the best  balance between the three types of simulation. With the  NTC,  the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC),  Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC),  and  the  BCTP at the forefront,  units  are  developing comprehensive strategies for  training in  the twenty-first century. The Combined Arms Training Strategy, which defines  the  resource  requirements  for  the  most  important  live  training tasks,  such  as i~ying hours  and  operating  tempo  (OPTEMPO)  miles,  is being redesigned.

AnnyTraining  XXI is the  Army' s approach to meeting the requirements of  warfare in the twenty-first century. The  strategy includes three fundamental elements: Warmod XXI, Warfighter XXJ, and Warrior XXI. Under Warmod XXI, training will  be conducted  to  ensure  that soldiers know how to operate new equipment, and training support products will be digitized.  Collective training will take place through  Warfighter XXI,

which  will  also  synchronize  the  thJee  elements,  and  Warrior  XXI  will consist  of institutional  and  self-development  training.  Eight  initiatives under Warrior XXl will guide leader development programs: Total Army School System (TASS), Classroom XXI, Distance Learning, Infrastructure/ Communications, Automations/Digitization, Training Development, Diagnostics, and Deployable Training (Institutional).

The critical effort in all of  these initiatives is that of  the Army Distance Learning Program, which, when completed, will enable 95  percent of all active  and  reserve  soldiers  to  attend  standardized  training  in  a  distance learning classroom within one hour's drive of  their home station. Through distance learning, soldiers will be able to complete required training when deployed,  reducing the  time  they spend away from  their families or their duty assignments and reducing costs to the Army. In addition to supporting Army  civilian training and  the Army  Continuing Education System, the Army  Distance  Learning  Program  has  been  identified  as  the  prototype for DOD's distance learniJ1g  initiative.  For the tasks that cannot be taught through distance learning, proponent schools are modernizing classrooms under Classroom XXI to be completely compatible with distance learning classrooms and to serve a dual purpose  for resident courses. The proponent school will also use Classroom XXl facilities to .develop course curricula for use in TASSan integrated system composed of  active Army schools, former  U.S. Army  Reserve  (USAR)  schools,  and ARNG state  military academies. In each of seven TASS regions, most proponent schools  will have a functionally aligned TASS battalion that they will accredit.

The  AJmy  provides  training  resources  to  meet  levels  of readiness as  measured  by  OPTEMPO.  OPTEMPO  is  used  to  estimate  the  funds necessary for  tempo (the number of miles driven per vehicle per year or the hours flown per flight crew per month) and the costs of  a unit's tactical tra ining. The funds are then provided to major commands (MACOM) for further distribution  to  individual  units. Direct costs for  POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants), repair parts, and depot-level repair, as well as indirect, recurring  operating  costs  for civilian  pay, travel, rail transportation, OCIE (organizational clothing and individual equipment), NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) supplies, and ADP (automated data processing) contracts  are  considered  when determining  funds  necessary  for  ground OPTEMPO. The ground OPTEMPO requirement of 800 miles describes the total  miles needed to execute an annual  training  program at a  C- 1 or C- 2 level of  readiness (the two highest of five  levels) for a tank battalion. The flying  hour  program  requirement of 14.0  hours  was  established  to enable an  aviation tmit to achieve this level of readiness and  is  driven  by the unit's Mission Essential Task List and Army regulatory requirements.

Ground OPTEMPO in FY 1997 continued to occur below programmed levels. Although execution of ground OPTEMPO increased slightly from

FY  1996 to  FY  1997 for the M l A 1 Abrams tank,  it decreased  for  both the  M2  Bradley Infantry  Fighting Vehicle  and  the M3  Bradley  Cavalry Fighting Vehicle, as shown in Table  23. USAR executed only 38 percent of  its OPTEMPO requirement in FY 1997, while ARNG and active Army executed 58 and 82 percent, respectively. Table 24 depicts the required and executed OPT  EM  PO for the active and reserve components for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.

Of the 998,950 flying hours programmed for FY 1997,95.4 percent, or 952,999  hours, were flown.  The active Army flew  32.7 percent of the hours flown,  which resulted in an execution of  the flying hour program of 14.1 hours per flight crew per month. The active Army has  now  reduced the  overall  funding  of the flying  hour program from  14.5  hou rs  to  14.0 hours,  although attack aircraft will continue to  be funded  at 14.5  hours. Table 25 indicates the required and executed flying hour program for FYs 1996 and 1997.

A  new  initiative,  Operational  Readiness  (OPRED),  focuses  on  the needs  and  requirements of the force-projection  Army.  Incorporating the new  Army  policy  that  near-term  readiness  consists  of more  than  unit training funds,  OPRED funding will reflect the  total cost of preparing a unit to go to war. In addition to OPTEMPO funding, OPRED will pay for associated costs, such as training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations; ranges; training areas; supply and maintenance operations and support; and power-projection facilities. Under OPRED, the programs will be linked so that readiness elements of  the Army budget can be better defended within DOD and before Congress.

Eleven  Combined  Arms Training  strategies  have  been  revised  and developed  as  a  baseline  for  Battalion  Level Training  Models,  used  to determine  training  resource  requirements.  The  Standard Army Training System is being revised  and will provide commanders with an improved capability to plan and execute training with available resources. A recently concluded  update  of AR 220- 1, Unit  Status  Reporting, includes  some OPRED reporting items.

Contingency operations have increased personnel tempo. In long-term operations, the rotation of  units affects four of  the same type at any given time. While one unit is conducting the mission, another is recovering from it,  and  a  third  is  preparing  for  it.  A  fourth  unit  is  in  support,  providing personnel replacements, combat support, and combat service support for the deployed unit, and observer/controllers and opposing force personnel to train the other two units. The average number of  soldiers deployed on a daily  basis, categorized as skill tempo, was 31,326 during FY 1997. The military occupational  specialties (MOS)  with  individuals who  spent the most time  away from home  station on  deployments were bridge  crewmember (12C),  imagery ground station operator (96H), psychological  operations specialist (37F), concrete and asphalt equipment operator (62H), and radar repairer (35M).

In a significant initiative during FY  1997 to improve readiness in  the TotalAnny, reserve component combat  support and combat service support units were integrated into CTC rotations with active Army maneuver units. The Army's CTCs are BCTP at Fort Leavenworth; CMTC; JRTC at Fort Polk;  and NTC. The Army's objective tlu-ough BCTP is to train all active Army division and corps staffs every two years, train  all ARNG division staffs every three years, and conduct 14 annual  rotations through Brigade Battle Command and Battle Staff training, a subset of BCTP.  During FY 1997, the Army conducted 2 corps and 6 division war  fighter exercises, 1 J reserve component rotations through Brigade Battle Command and Battle Sta-ff training, and 12 Operations Group Delta Joint Task Force exercises. At CMTC, the goal is to train  5 U.S. brigade task forces annually, which was accomplished  in FY  1997, and  3  German  and  4  other Allied  units (British, French, or  Dutch) each year. Ten units are expected to rotate each year through JRTC and NTC, with 9 from the active Army and the tenth, an Enhanced Separate Brigade, from ARNG, and I  0 rotations tlu-ough  each of  these CTCs occurred in FY 1997. Four new training facilities were built in FY 1997: a close combat tactical trainer (CCTT) at Fort Stewart for $6.0 million; an urban training complex for armored vehicles at Fort Knox for $13.0 million; a range control facility at Fort Drum for $3.8 million; and a CCTT at Fort Hood for $5.9 million.

The Army  also conducts some of its  institutional  training overseas. The Jungle Operations Training Center (JOTC), located at Fort Sherman, Panama,  provides training for eleven  battalions  from  the  United  States each year. JOTC is equipped to train light infantrymen, airborne soldiers, Rangers,  air  assault  troops,  and  U.S. Marine  Corps  infantrymen.  In addition, engineer  jungle warfare training and aircrew survival courses are taught at JOTC. During FY 1997, five hundred paratroopers belonging to the  1st Battalion, 505th Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division, from Fort Bragg, North  Carolina, spent five  months in  Panama,  first  training at JOTC and then serving as a contingency security force for U.S. Army, South (USARSO). In addition, JOTC provides an important opportunity for military-to-military progra.ms in the U.S. Southern  Command (SOUTH  COM). Latin American and Caribbean nations send members of their armies to JOTC to learn U.S. Infantry jungle operations. At the same time, jungle instructors  fi·om  these  nations  are  integrated  into  JOTC's school cadre. On a routine basis, a regional platoon is attached to the U.S. Infantry  battalions rotating through  JOTC, enabling  the U.S.  soldiers  to train beside jungle experts. During FY 1997, JOTC hosted platoons from Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Venezuela.

The  Army's  approach to initial  entry training  has changed substantially, in  accordance with  Character Development XXl.  In the  past, a  soldier attended 8 weeks of  basic combat training (BCT) and then4 to 52 weeks

of advanced  individual  training,  or  received  one  station  unit  training (OSUT) of 12 to 18 weeks whi le remaining at one post and in one training unit.  In  FY  J  997  the Army added an additional week of training to  both BCT and OSUT to teach Army history and values.  Each of  the six Army values (honor, integrity, courage, respect, selfless service, and duty) was designated as the theme for one week during training, during which time the commanders, drill sergeants, and school cadre emphasized that value through discussions of  Army history and use of  training aids. The Army is  in  the planning stages of  adding a Warrior week to  BCT and OSUT to ease the  transition of trainees  from  their civilian  past to  soldier future. In  this  three-day  exercise,  trainees  will  operate  in  a  simulated  combat environment as a team, moving their location, communicating, and firing weapons.  Following a ceremony and  long-distance  march,  the  trainees will  receive an  Esprit de  Corps  breakfast.  During  FY  1997,  a  total  of 64,596 soldiers completed BCT and  58,346 graduated from  initial MOS training.

Army  training  is  conducted  also  for  future  soldiers. From  May  to August  1997, the U.S.  Army Cadet  Command trained sixty-five thousand cadets  from  colleges  and  universities  throughout  the  United  States  in thirteen  cycles  of the  Reserve  Officers Training  Corps' advanced  camp at  Fort  Lewis.  Preparing cadets and  officer candidates  for  service  in  the active Army, ARNG, and  USAR,  the  advanced camp provided  intensive leadership  development  and  military  training.  In  1997, TRADOC  held a  ruturc  Battle  Conference  at  Fort  Hood,  attended  by  U.S.  and  Israeli commandants of their respective infantry,  armor,  aviation,  field  artillery, air defense artillery, and engineer schools, to discuss changing doctrine and techniques, particularly the Force XXI process and Israeli  modernization and organizational changes.

Each Army MACOM participated in major military exercises, whether single-service, joint, or combined, during FY 1997 to maintain or increase readiness,  as  well  as  to  enhance  U.S.  presence  in  other  regions  of the world  and  improve  military-to-military  relations.  The  Forces  Command (FORSCOM) orients its training strategy around CTCs and a comprehensive premobilization training program for reserve component units.  During FY 1997  more  than  45,000  FORSCOM  soldiers  participated  in  fifty  major exercises, such  as  BLuE  fLAG,  BRIGIIT  STAR, FuERTES  DHt  ..  ENSAS (Defense Forces), RoviNG  SANDS, and ULC III  Focus LENS.  In the world's largest joint tactical air operations exercise, Rov1  ·a SANDS 97, all U.S. military services, as  well as those from Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands, participated in  a  nine-day  exercise  in  an  area  covering 30,000 square  miles between Fort  Bliss, Texas, and  Roswell, New  Mexico, including  the  White  Sands Missile  Range  in  New Mexico.  Of the  20,000 participants,  I  0,500  were Army soldiers,  including  a theater  missile  defense element.  SMDC  was

fully  integrated into RoviNG SANDS and was able to provide ballistic missile defense and force protection.

The  Defense  Against  Weapons  of Mass  Destruction  Act  of  l  996 requires  federal agencies  to  implement programs  to  respond  to  an  NBC attack.  Army  soldiers  deployed  to  Denver,  Colorado,  in  June  1997,  as Response Task Force-West to participate in  MEASURED RI~SPONSE 97- 2, a federal, state, and local exercise to train  local civilian emergency response agencies to handle an NBC attack. The Army task force included command, control,  communications,  and intelligence personnel  and equipment; liaison  and  medical  personnel;  and  chemical  and  biological  technical escort and response elements.

Other events enhanced  U.S.  interoperability  with  foreign  militaries. J\bout2,l OOsoldiersfrom FORSCOM and the U.S.Army Special Operations Command  participated  in  CooPERATIVE  NuGGET  from  June  to  July  1997 at  the .JRTC as  part of the  North Atlantic Treaty  Organization's (NATO) Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP)  program.  CooPERATIVE NuGGET,  designed  to foster interoperability, trained platoons and companies in peacekeeping and humanitarian  relief tactics,  techniques, and  communications  procedures. A total  of  4,000 individuals, including  I  ,000 military personnel  from  four NATO  countries  and  eighteen  Pff&gt;  nations,  participated  in  the  exercise. United  States troops included cavalry, aviation, medical, combat support, and special forces personnel. In another significant step towards improving military  relations, the CSA  hosted meetings  with the  Commander of the Guangzhou Military Region from the People's Republic of  China during a visit  by the Chinese Minister of Defense to the United States, and  with his designated counterpart from China, the Deputy Chief  of  the General Staff, in  the  fi rst such exchange since  1 988.

On I  June 1997  SOUTIICOM  assumed  responsibility  from  the U.S. Atlantic Command  for U.S. military forces operating in the Caribbean  Basin  and  the  Gulf of Mexico,  expanding  USARSO's area of  responsibility  to  include  thirty-two  sovereign  nations  and  twelve protectorates  in  Latin America and  the  Caribbean, except  for  Mexico. In  FY  1996  USARSO's responsibility was  limited to  nineteen  nations. USARSO, which provides disaster relief response, counterdrug support, and  international trainjng programs,  is composed of 2,300 soldiers and 2,000  civilians  who  host  25,000  ARNG  and  USAR  troops  annually in multilateral  programs.  In Nur:vos HoRtZONTES (New  Horizons)  97, SOUTHCOM sponsored engineer and  medical  field  training  exercises (FTX) in  Panama,  Belize, and  Bolivia  from  January through June  1997 to  increase  regional  civil-military cooperation and  promote democratic institutions.  In  Panama, engineers  renovated,  constructed, or improved seven schools, two clinics, four kilometers of  road, and  four wells, while medical  personnel provided health  care to civilians in several  locations.

Engineers  constructed  and  renovated  schools  and  roads  in Belize  and built health cl i .nics in  Bolivia.

Other  exercises took  place in the Atlantic Command  area of responsibility. Two  hundred paratroopers from  the 82d Airborne Division deployed to Haiti  in April  1997 for FAIRWINDS  97, a one-week contingency readiness  exercise  involving  1,200  personnel,  in  which  they  learned  to protect U.S.  forces conducting humanitarian and civic assistance missions. During JuNGLE  WARRIOR, a rotational battalion training exercise from Apri l 1996  to  May 1997,  SOUTH  COM  received  an in-theater  contingency infantry  force  while  one  of its  units  was  being  reconstituted.  In  other military-to-military exchanges, SOUTI  JCOM hosted the Conference ofthc American Armies, attended  by  representatives from  Canada and  fourteen Latin American armies,  as well  as observers from  Mexico and  nine other Latin  American  and  Caribbean  nations.  To  build  personal  relationships with  senior  military  leaders  and  demonstrate USARSO's  training  and sustainment program, USARSO hosted commanding  generals  from Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Guyana in  its Distinguished Visitor  Program  during  FY  1997. The  Latin American  Communications Conference, held in Puerto Rico inAprill997 and attended by signal officers from sixteen nations, resulted in a reference manual of  common terms and included a command post exercise (CPX)  that examined communications issues identified during FuERZ;JSAUADIIS (Allied Forces) and FvENZAS UNII)/IS (United Forces), two peacekeeping operations.

Third U.S.  Army provides the U.S.  Central Command (CENTCOM), responsible for a geographic area that spans northeast  Africa and Southwest Asia,  with  its Army element, Army Forces Central Command (ARCENT).  In  a  theater  of operations,  ARCENT's responsibility  is  to provide support and  infrastructure  for Army, joint, and combined forces. Each year during BRIGilT STAR, one of  CENTCOM's major exercises, U.S. and  Egyptian forces  conduct maneuvers with France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Persian Gulf nations. The exercise is complemented by  the  U.S.- Egyptian  Senior  Land  Commanders' Exchange  Program, in  which  a U.S.  Army  division  commander spends  ten  to  fourteen  days with an  Egyptian division, observing operations and sharing information, and  then  hosts  a  return  visit  to  his  division  by  the  Egyptian  division co1nmander. Through  INTRINSI C  ACTION,  a ncar-continuous presence of an Army  battalion  task  force  rotating  through a four-month  exercise  in  the Kuwaiti desert, CENTCOM enhances regional stability and the U.S. ability to  deploy  quickly  to  the  region.  Each  task  force,  which  consists of  three cavalry troops, a field artillery battery, and an engineer company, conducts coalition training with similar Kuwaiti  army units and participates in tank gunnery  ranges,  engineer breach  operations,  and  artillery  firing. In  FY 1997, a  total  of 3,100  soldiers  were  deployed  from  Fort  Hood  in three

rotations,  drawing  equipment  from  war  reserve  combat equipment  pre› positioned at ARCENT-Kuwait.  In  another military-to-military program, ARCENT  units  participated  with  Pakistani  forces  in  Pakistan  for  two weeks  in  June  1997  in  INSPIRED  GAMI31T  97,  an  exercise  that  focused  on training in  individual, squad, and platoon combat skills.

In  the  United  States  European Command  (EUCOM),  which  covers an  area  of responsibility  comprising  83  nations  on  3 continents,  I  ,220 United States Army, Europe (USAREUR), soldiers participated in  15 PfP exercises in  I J countries with the military  forces of 12  NATO and 24  PfP nations  during FY 1997.  ln  addition,  the  George  C.  Marshall  European Center for  Security  Studies  in  Garmisch, Germany,  provided a  tailored, advanced professional education on democratic institutions and values for military and civilian officials  from  NATO and PtP nations. United States troops joined those from  seven Central Asian countries in CENTRAWAT,  a PtP human assistance and peacekeeping exercise held  in September 1997 in  the  United  States,  Kazakhstan,  and  Uzbekistan.  Forty  Central  Asian paratroopers  teamed  with  a  U.S.  airborne  battalion  in  conducting  the longest airborne operation on record, leaving Fort Bragg and jumping into Kazakhstan, where they linked up with other Central Asian paratroopers and ground  forces.  In USAREUR's Joint Contact Team Program, to promote a  civilian-controlled  military  in  a  democracy,  nearly  900  U.S.  soldiers traveled  to  14  countries, and  U.S.  units  hosted 311  foreign  delegations  in 638 military-to-military contacts.

USAREUR's  major  combat element, V Corps, relies upon a multiechelon  training  strategy  to  train  its  units  in conventional  warfare. VICTORY  STRIKE  in FY 1997,  employing  the  l st  Armored  Division  and two  separate brigades, trained V Corps headquarters to  function as a joint task force (JTF) and evaluated six other separate corps brigades. V Corps demonstrated  strengths,  gained  from its  experience  in Operation  JOINT ENDEAVOR, in command and control, deliberate river-crossing operations,  and employment and control of  Army aviation and tactical air. USAREUR units returning  from  JOINT  ENDEAVOR  practiced  warfighting skills  at Taborfalva Training Area, established in Hungary by the 7th Army Training Command and  the Hungarian government. To prepare communities for  planned  and unplanned  deployments,  USAREUR created  the  Family  Support System Mobile Training Team, and, in Aprill997, before a planned deployment to Africa, trained and certified Southern European  Task Force rear detachment commanders, family support liaison personnel, Family Assistance Center personnel, and family support group volunteers.

Within the  U.S. Pacific Command (P/\COM), the United States Army, Pacific's  (USARPAC) responsibility encompasses 60 percent of  the world's population in forty-one countries across sixteen time zones, carried out by 35,600 soldiers and civilians stationed throughout the Pacific region. The

commander in  chief, PACOM,  executes  national  military strategy  in  the region to enhance security, maintain stability, and terminate any conflict on terms favorable to the United States. USARPAC provides theater command and  control  of  Army  forces,  many  of which  will  be  deployed  from  the continental  United States (CONUS) in  the event of  conflict. Thirty-seven thousand  U.S.  Forces  Korea  soldiers,  from  Eighth  Army,  and  700,000 Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers form  the Combined Forces Command (CFC)  to  counter  the  threat  to  stability  from  the  Democratic  People's Republic  of Korea  and  to  control  coalition forces  if deterrence fails.  To improve  its  joint  and  combined  countcrfire  capability,  CFC  published a  manual  to  provide  guidance  and  assign  responsibility  to  component commanders. In addition,  the CFC operations plan  for  defense of Korea was revised and is being staffed by the ROK and U.S. governments.  Created following  the  update  of the  theater  campaign  plan,  an  Army  service component  command  will  organize,  equip,  train,  maintain,  and  sustain Army forces, improving Army warllghting capability.

PACOM conducts a variety of exercises. Its  major strategic  mobility exercise, CooRA Gou:r-a joint and combined training exercise designed to train a contingency JTFimproves combat readiness and  interoperability, enhances security relations,  and  demonstrates  U.S.  resolve  in  the  region. COBRA Gow was  conducted  in  the  Kingdom  of  Thai land  in  May  1997 with approximately twenty-seven thousand Thai and U.S.  forces,  of  whom two  thousand  were  U.S.  soldiers  and  mostly  from  USARPAC,  engaging in  a CPX,  a cross-training exercise, an  FTX,  and  a combined-arms force demonstration.  Another  joint  and  combined  exercise,  TANDEM  THRUST, takes  place  every  eighteen  months  to  two  years  as  a  CPX  and  an  FTX. Located  in  Australia  for  the  first  time  in  1997, TANDEM  THRUST  began  in February  and  ended  in  March,  with  active Army  and  reserve component soldiers  conducting  interoperability  training  with  Australian  forces  and participating in squad and platoon live-fire exercises and combined live-fire drills. Additiona  joint  and combined exercises were KEEN I EDGE in Japan and BALIKATAN  in  the Philippines. To  improve interoperability and warfighting skills,  YAMA  SAKURA,  a  bilateral  CPX  involving  Japan  and  the  United States,  took place  from  January  to  February  1997.  In an  annual bilateral exercise designed  to  teach winter warfare and Arctic  survival  skills,  U.S. Army soldiers trained  from February  to  March 1997  in  Hokkaido, Japan. As  part  of the  Joint  Combined  Exchange  Training  program,  active  and reserve soldiers deployed  in  July  1997  to  Indonesia  to  teach  trainers how to conduct advanced airborne, reconnaissance, and infantry training, and to the Maldives to teach infantry, urban combat, and land navigation skills.

ULCHI  Focus Li!NS,  conducted to  test operations plans for the defense of South  Korea,  is  one  of three  major  joint  and  combined  exercises conducted annually by U.S. and ROK forces, in conjunction with the ROK

National  Mobilization Exercise  ULCIJI. The largest exercise of its kind  in the  world,  ULCIII  Focus  LENS  is  a theater-wide  CPX  conducting  warfare from the tactical to the strategic level. lt stresses command and control and uses  a  sophisticated  worldwide  simulations  network  based on  advanced communications hardware. More than eighty-three hundred soldiers from Eighth Army and other MACOMs participated in ULCJII  Focus LENS 97  in Korea  in August. To  train  ROK and  U.S.  personnel  to  receive units  from CONUS in an emergency deployment in defense of  South Korea, the CPX Rs01 (Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and [ntcgration) took place in  April  1997, with 900 U.S.  soldiers participating,  resulting in  improved command  and  control.  RsoJ-TURl30  CllALLENGE,  another  major  exercise involving  the  United  States and  South  Korea, took  place  in April  1997 with  Eighth Army elements, other Army units, and the U.S. Transportation Command simulating strategic deployments into  Korea.  FoAL  EAGLE,  the third major  joint and combined exercise in Korea, focused on mobilization, rear-area security, and special operations.

USARPAC  conducts  numerous  military-to-military  contacts  in  the region. It hosts the Pacific  Armies Management Seminar (PAMS), designed to facilitate and enhance interactions among armies in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions and to discuss training for unconventional missions. From the  initial  seminar in  1978, with representatives  from nine nations, the  PAMS  held  in  Hawaii  in  April  1997  had  grown  to  include attendees from  forty-one  nations.  Military delegates from Vietnam and Uzbekistan attended  for  the  first  time in  FY  1997.  USARPAC  also  initiated  the Expanded  Relations  Program  (ERP),  consisting  of senior  officer  visits, staff information exchanges, conferences, humanitarian assistance, individual and unit training  exchanges,  and bilateral and combined exercises, with other countries in  the Asia-Pacific region.  Included  in  the ERP are ULCill  Focus LENS,  FoAL  EAGLE,  and  Rso1  in  Korea,  as  well  as YAMA  SAKURA,  NoRTHWIND,  and  ORIENT  SHIELD  in  Japan. The  ERP also encompassed  the annual  visit by a Command and  General  Staff College team, which  in  FY  1997 traveled to  India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and  Pakistan.  USARPAC  representation  on  the  Mutual  Defense  Board with  the Philippines and  the annual  PACOM staff talks  with Indonesia, Malaysia,  and  Singapore  were  some  of ERP's activities.  In  addition  to TANDEM Til  RUST, Australia hosted a visit by the CSA and engineer readiness training exercises. The latter also occurred  in the Marshall Islands, Tonga, and Fiji. The  INDO-US Executive Steering Group  is another USARPAC initiative and  is designed to develop and approve army-to-army programs between India  and  the United  States and  enhance  relationships  between senior  leaders. fn one  civic  action  project,  58  engineer  soldiers  fi·om Hawaii were assigned to Micronesia from July through November 1997 to build a school, a warehouse, and a classroom.

## Deployed Operational Forces

At  the  end  of FY  1 997,  the  Army  had 125,000  soldiers  stationed permanently as its forward force in other nations.  Seventy-five percent of  the Army remained in CONUS, while 13 percent was stationed in Europe,  I  0 percent in the Pacific, and 2 percent elsewhere. In addition, 32,000 soldiers were deployed temporarily in seventy countries. Of  the deployed soldiers, 12,000 in  twenty-four countries  had  been provided  by  FORSCOM, with 6,000 stationed in Bosnia. Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  for which U.S. troops were mobi.lized in  1995 to support NATO's monitoring of  the Dayton Peace Accords  in  Bosnia, was extended by  the  National  Command Authorities in  December  1996  as a stabilization  force  and  renamed  Operation  JO INT GuARD.  The  stabilization  force  (SFOR)  was  composed  of thirty-nine nations,  including  Russia, during  FY  1 997. Between  9,000  and  . II ,000 U.S. soldiers participated in JoiNT GuAR D, a EUCOM operation, at any one time in  Bosnia, Croatia, or Hungary,  monitoring and controlling warring factions, providing  security, coordinating international  relief, aiding displaced persons to return  to  their country, and restoring or establishing government institutions.

The U.S. contribution to JO INT GuARD  is centered in  the Multinational Division (North). Although built initially around the headquarters and the 3d Brigade of  the 1st Infantry Division, the Multinational Division, located in Tuzla, Bosnia, includes many other U.S. active and reserve forces on six› month  rotation  tours,  as  well as  three  multinational  brigadesRussian, Turkish,  and  Nordic-Polish. The political advisor,  the translator, the civil engineer, and  the  operations  officer advise  the  division  commander on the  proper allocation  of military  resources.  Video  teleconferencing  and wide data  networks  permit real-time situational  awareness and  facilitate split-base  operations  and  decisive  application of power.  New  peace  and information operations  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  were  created with  each new  operations order as the  simultaneous political, economic, and civil-military tasks were conducted. In August 1997, eighteen hundred members of the  2d Armored  Cavalry Regiment at  Fort Polk,  Louisiana, deployed  to  Europe  to  replace  the  I  st Infantry  Division  as  the  primary U.S. combat  force  in  Bosnia.  Members of the  1st  fnfantry  Division  are scheduled to redeploy to CONUS in early October after a transition period with the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment.

In  addition to JoiNT GUARD, EUCOM  was  responsible  for  other operations.  One  of its  primary  operational missions  was Task Force ABLE SENTRY, in which  USAREUR  soldiers  participated in  the  UN  (United Nations) Preventive Deployment  peacekeeping  mission  in  the  former Yugoslav  Republic  of Macedonia.  Although  the  missionto which  an infantry, cavalry, or armor battalion task force deployed every six months to

conduct border patrolswas scheduled to end in May 1997, the UN Security Council extended the mission mandate for an additional six months. During Operation SILVE R  W AKE  in FY  1 997, USAREUR evacuated civilian displaced persons from Albania to rtaly. Another noncombatant evacuation operation occurred in  Operation NoBL E OBELISK,  when 2,509 persons,  including 454 American  citizens,  were  safely  removed  from  Freetown,  Sierra Leone, following a military coup. A Special Forces team supported the operation by providing regional expertise and security  for U.S.  citizens before the ships arrived for  evacuation.  Although  USAREUR soldiers  from  the  Southern European Task Force deployed  in  March  1 997  to  the  Congo and  Gabon for Operation  GuAR D IAN RETRIEVAL, another  noncombatant  evacuation, the  mission was  handed  over to  the Marine  Corps in April,  and  the Army task force  returned  to  Jtaly.  In  June  1997  eight Army  Special  Operations Forces  (SOF)  soldiers  assisted  in  the  evacuation  of 57  noncombatants from  the Congo. USAREUR continued  to  support the  Beirut Air  Bridge, a  communications  link  with  the American  Embassy  in  Beirut,  Lebanon, through  a  forward  aviation  detachment  stationed  on  Cyprus. In  addition, USAREUR soldiers participated  in  the  UN Military Observation Group  in Monrovia and Operation GUARDIAN ASSISTANCE in Rwanda.

In  the  SOUTHCOM  area  of  responsibility,  the  Army  carried  out a variety  of operations.  Sixty U.S.  soldiers  and  four  U. H - 60  helicopters continued  to  provide  support  to  the  Military Observer  Mission  Ecuador and Peru (MOMEP) in JTF SAFE BORDER in the disputed region between the two countries. Originally established for ninety days in  March 1995, SAFE BoRDER was extended until December J  997. The United States, Argentina, Brazil, and  Chile  operate  MOMEP, with  each country  responsible for  a specific  staff function along  the  78  kilometers  of the  contested  border. Army Special  Operations  Forces  provide critical  communications  in  the rugged mountainous terrain and canopy jungle, as well  as language skills, cultural  knowledge,  and  interpersonal  skills. Operation  SusTAIN Lmmrrv, in  which  a  mi litary  police  company  spends  six  months  protecting  U.S. installations in Panama, continued with two rotations during FY 1997. JTF BRAVO  was established  in  Honduras in  1984 to conduct  and  support joint and combined operations and, during FY 1997, coordinated the presence of U.S. forces  in  Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. f'UERZAS ALtADAS, a peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, was  conducted  in  El  Salvador; F uEUZAS UN!DAS was  a  peacekeeping operation  in  Brazil  in  which  UN  forces  fu lly  participated;  and  the  UN Mission  in  Guatemala,  with  two  U.S.  officers  assigned,  monitored  the surrender of  weapons before national elections.

The primary  focus  of U.S.  Army  operations  in  the  CENTCOM  area of responsibility  in  FY  1 997  was  enforcing  the  sanctions  that  the  UN had  imposed  upon  Iraq  in  the  early  1990s.  Following  a  terrorist attack

in June  1996, CENTCOM had developed a plan for  force protection and relocation. ln Operation DESERT  Focus in August, CENTCOM  had moved Army forces  to  more  defensible  locations and  had  provided  an  infantry battalion  to  secure  Patriot  missile  sites  and  other  U.S.  facilities.  DESERT Focus  now  refers only  to  the  force  protection  mission conducted  by the infantry battalion. Following Saddam Hussein's  attack on Kurds in northern Iraq  in  August  1996, U.S.  forces  had  deployed  to  Kuwait  in  Operation VIGILANT TIIUNDER  to preclude retaliatory strikes against Kuwait when the UN conducted missile strikes against Iraq  in  Operation DESERT  STRIKE  in September.  In  January  1997  the  UN  implemented  Operation  NoRTHERN WA"rc1 1 , a no-fly zone prohibiting Iraqi aircraft in the skies of  northern iraq above the 36th parallel. The northern  boundary of the existing Operation SouTHERN  WATCII,  enforcement  of a  no-fly  zone  in  southern  Iraq,  had been expanded from  the 32d to the 33d parallel in September  1996. Army personnel  participated  in  both  NORTIIIiRN  WATC II and  SOUTIIERN  WKrC II during  FY  1997. The U.S.  part of the NoRTHERN  WATC H  force  operates as part ofEUCOM. CENTCOM controls the U.S. partofthe SouTHERN WATCII force. EUCOM  supports  Operation  SOUTIIERN  WATCH  by  occasionally deploying  forces  in  support  of the  operation.  EUCOM  provides  forces and  logistic  support  to  CENTCOM as  needed  during  both  routine  and contingency operations.

To  facilitate  a  rapid transition to war,  ARCENT  has  established three  small,  forward  command  and  control  activities  that  also  provide vital  contributions  in  peacetime. ARCENT-Kuwait, outside Kuwait City, coordinates and supports joint and combined training in  Kuwait, oversees the  pre-positioned  Army  War  Reserve-S  combat  stocks,  and  provides command-and-control  and  force  protection  for  assigned  and  attached Army forces in Kuwait. Preparing to receive its second battalion task force set  of pre-positioned  equipment  (PPE),  ARCENT-Qatar  is  refining  its procedures for activating its set of  equipment and  improving its relations with the military forces of  Qatar. The PPE at ARCENT-Kuwait and afloat, added to the brigade set and division  base of PPE planned for ARCENT› Qatar, will provide the division PPE envisioned by the commander in chief, Central  Command  (CINCCENT).  In  addition,  ARCENT-Qatar  provides installation services  for  all  U.S.  military  forces  in  Qatar.  Command  and control of Patriot  units  from FORSCOM  and  Europe,  present  under Operation  PROVIDE CovER,  as  well  as  all  Army  forces  in  Saudi  Arabia, Bahrain,  and  Qatar,  is  provided  by  ARCENT-Saudi  Arabia,  which  is also rcsponsjblc  for  theater  ballistic  missile  defense  for key  military and  civilian  facilities.  Under  Operation  DESERT  FAI.CON,  seven  hundred USAREUR air defense artillery soldiers arrived  in  Saudi Arabia  in  May 1997 for six months. CJNCCENT's  plan to deter regional aggression in the Persian  Gulf is  predicated  on  maintaining seven  ships afloat  as  a supply

depot, including a port opening package, a heavy brigade set of  Army Pre› positioned Stocks- 3 (Afloat), and a divisional support base.

The  U.S.  Army  was  involved  in  numerous  multinational  operations. During the fiscal  year,  three infantry battalions began and (or) ended six› month rotational  tours with  the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai, an independent (non-UN) peacekeeping mission established in 1979 to  help  monitor the demilitarized zone and  provisions of the peace treaty between Israel  and  Egypt that pertain  to  the Sinai. Two officers remained assigned  to  the  UN  Truce  Supervision  Organization  in  Jerusalem  that supports peacekeeping operations throughout the Middle East, while eight officers  were  stationed  with  the  UN  Mission  for  the  Referendum  in  the Western  Sahara to  monitor elections and supervise the ceasefire between Morocco and Polisario insurgents.

Ten  percent  or USARPAC's force  was  deployed  in  FY  1997  .  .JTF PACIFIC HAVEN  took  place  on  Guam,  where  sixty-six  hundred  Kurdish evacuees were  sheltered  before  being  relocated  to  the  United  States  by the  end  of April  1997.  Most USARPJ\C  soldiers  were  infantry,  military police, and K9 dog team personnel whose mission was to provide security for  the  evacuees,  although  other  soldiers  gave  administrative,  medical, engineering,  public  affairs,  psychological  operations,  civil  affairs,  and linguistic support Established in 1992 to  investigate, identify, and recover the  remains  of Americans  unaccounted  for  in  Southeast Asia,  JTF  FuLL AccouNTING,  with  its  headquarters  in  Hawaii  and  detachments  in  Laos, Vietnam,  Thailand,  and Cambodia,  continued  in  FY 1997.  Through the  efTorts  of sixty  soldiers,  remains  were  recovered  at  five  of six  sites excavated in Vietnam in April  1997. Another hundred soldiers and civilians conducted an additional FULL AccouNTING operation in Vietnam in August. In  Laos,  thirty-five  soldiers excavated  nine sites between April  and  June 1997 in  the thirty-third operation  in that country.

USARPAC conducted numerous other missions. One of  them was JTF MARATHON PACIFIC. Undocumented immigrants who had been intercepted in the Pacific Ocean were transferred to Wake Island, where USARPAC units provided  security,  sustained  the  immigrants,  and  processed  them  before they  were  flown  back  to  China.  In  another humanitarian  mission, Army medical and  forensic  personnel. from  Hawaii  were  deployed  to  Guam  in August 1997 as part of  an  Emergency  Response Team following the crash or  Korean Airlines Plight 801. The medical team included two critical-care nurses,  a general  surgeon,  two  orthopedic surgeons, two  operating room nurses, and an anesthesiologist,  while  the  forensic  team consisted  of one radiologist and three radiology technicians.

Under the Chemical Weapons Convention,  all stockpiled U.S. chemical  weapons  arc  required  to  be  demilitarized  by  200 I. The  U.S. Army Chemical Activity,  Pacific,  has had  the  responsibility for  security,

storage, and  transportation  of all  chemical munitions  on  Johnston Atoll, eight hundred miles southwest of Hawaii, and in the last seven years  has demilitarized more than 2.7 million pounds ofthechemical weapons stored on  the  island.  The  first  Chemical  Weapons  Convention  Inspections  on Johnston Atoll began in August 1997. Teams from the Organization for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons, the On-Site Inspection Agency, and the U.S.  Army Chemical Activity,  Pacific, conducted preinspection briefings. Two  teams  then  inventoried  the  contents  of thirty  storage  bunkers,  and a  third  team  inspected  documents  and  reviewed  the  inventory.  The  U.S. Army Chemical Activity was found to be in complete compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.

In  1993 DOD was designated as the lead federal  agency to detect and monitor the illegal aerial and maritime transit  of  drugs into the United States. DOD's counterdrug policy enhances federal  and host-nation programs and supports federal, state, and local drug law enforcement agencies (DLEA). The Army's  counterdrug budget in FY 1997 was $276 million, a $46 million increase since FY 1996, with $ 11 7 million allotted to the active Army, $10 million  to  USAR, and  $ 1 49 to  ARNG.  During FY  1997  the Total  Army provided more than 4,000 soldiers daily for operational and nonoperational support to civilian DLEAs and MACOM commanders. About J 70 soldiers and  civilians were assigned  to  counterdrug JTFs,  and  21  were detailed to federal agencies. Primary Army missions within the United States included linguist  and  intelligence  support,  as  well  as  road  and  fence  construction along the Southwest border. The secretary of  defense, however, suspended all  Army  reconnaissance,  surveillance,  and  monitoring operations  in  July 1997 after a  marine shot  a civi  I an during a counterdrug intelligence mission. i Total  Army aviation assets were programmed to fly 46,000 hours in support of  the counterdrug program in the United States, with some fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft on loan to the U.S. Customs Service.

As of  the end of  the third quarter ofFY 1997, soldiers had participated in  67  counterdrug deployments  from  CONUS. Support to  other nations consisted  of counterdrug  training,  transportation  aboard U.S. aircraft, intelligence, mission planning, and reconnaissance. In addition to supporting counterdrug  missions  in  nine  Latin American  countries  and select Caribbean  nations,  the  Army conducted counterdrug  training in Southeast  and  Southwest  Asian  countries.  In  the  bilateral  military› to-military  program  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico,  the  Army provided  instructors for  new  Mexican  counterdrug special  forces  units; conducted  pilot  and  aviation  mai ntenance  training;  and  established  an airmobile capability for Mexican counterdrug w1its. Counterdrug training for  Mexican  instructors  began  in FY  1996  and  will  continue  through September 2000, with 126 personnel trained each year. Seventy-three UH1  1-1 helicopters, with a two-year supply of  spare parts and  aviation ground

support  equipment, were  transferred  to  Mexico  by  the  end  of FY  1 997 for  the  Mexican counterdrug program,  with  the Army providing training for pilots, aviation maintenance personnel, and other support personnel at TRADOC schools. The Army expects to train 450 Mexican pilots per year through 200 I at  the Spanish language rotary-wing course that it operates for  foreign  mili taries  and  DLEAs.  To  support  sustainment  training  of Mexican pilots, the Army is currently installing in Mexico a UH- lll night simulator that will be operational in April 1998.

The  Army  is  the  lead  agency  for providing  military  support  to civilian authorities during natural disasters and, since february  1 997,  for international  and  special  events.  In  FY  1997  the  Army  provided  5,297 active Army  soldiers;  12,325  ARNG  soldiers;  133  VSAR  soldiers;  and I  ,419  soldiers  from  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of Engineers  (USACE)  for disaster  relief or special-event support  during  1 2  instances  affecting  21 states.  The  largest  number  of soldiers,  5,276,  was  provided  to  support the 1997  Presidential  Inaugural in January  1997  in  Washington,  D.C. The  Army's  Director  of Military  Support  (DOMS)  planned  the  DOD ceremonial  and  contingency  support,  led  the  interagency  coordination process, and planned responses to terrorist threats and other emergencies. Eight hundred Army soldiers provided security; 279 served on the Armed Forces  Inaugural  Committee;  and  I  ,636  participated  in  the  swearing-in ceremony, the presidential escort, the inaugural parade, presidential honor cordons,  and  inaugural  balls.  Army  units  in  the parade  included  the Old Guard;  the  U.S.  Army Field  Band  from  Fort Meade,  Maryland; the 80th (USAR)  Institutional Training  Division  Band;  the  District of Columbia National Guard; the Military District of  Washington ceremonial band and choruses; and U.S. Military Academy cadets. An additional  1,125 soldiers supported 35,000 Boy Scouts at the National Scout Jamboree at Fort A. P. Hill, Virginia, from 28 July to 6 August 1 997, providing logistical, security, transportation, medical, engineer, and communications support.

Once  a  Presidential Disaster  Declaration  has  been  approved,  the DOMS sends a defense contracting officer to the afflicted area to validate all military support requirements and to assign missions to the appropriate unit. A total of  4,576 soldiers provided relief  efforts during Hurricane Fran from September through October 1996 in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia;  4,153  in  March  1 997  during Ohio  River flooding; 3,074  in April  1997 during floods  in North  Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and 1,287 during flooding in  the Northwest in January  1997. The USACE spent  $12  million  to  fight  noods  in  three  states,  building  levees  around hospitals and homes.

The  Defense  Against  Weapons  of Mass  Destruction  Act  of  1996 authorizes federal resources, training, and technical assistance to state and local  emergency management personnel who provide the first response to

weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorist incidents. As the executive agency  for  DOD,  the  Army  created  the  Domestic  Preparedness  Section within  DOMS  to  implement program  requirements, developed  a training and  exercise  program,  created  a  federal  response  team,  and  completed an  inventory  of assets.  During  FY  1997,  the  Army  assessed  response procedures in 27 cities and will complete reviews in a total of 120 cities by October 1999. After the initial visits, the Chemical and Biological Defense Command from Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, provided one week of training  for  firefighters,  law  enforcement  personnel,  and  emergency medical  service personnel. Training will  be completed  in all cities by  the end ofFY 2001.

The  Army's Technical  Escort  Unit,  established  in 1943  to  handle WMD and biological and chemical materials, provided support for thirty chemical or biological emergencies in  FY 1997 and was assigned to assist the Peele  raJ  Bureau of  Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of  Transportation, and  the  Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. DOMS also directed explosive ordnance disposal support in twelve separate missions during the year for the Department of  Justice, the District of Columbia, Texas,  California, Michigan,  Maryland,  the  Saudi Arabian ambassador, and the Afghanistan Embassy.

Special operations forces provide yet another  tool for the military. Army SOF,  consisting of Special  Forces,  Rangers,  special operations aviation, psychological operations (PSYOP), and civil affairs (CA), composed nearly 70  percent ofDOD's  SOF personnel in FY  1997. Special Forces soldiers tra in  and assist foreign  military and paramilitary forces  in  unconventional warfare,  internal  defense,  special  reconnaissance, counterterrorism,  and humanitarian assistance operations. In addition, they can conduct joint or combined operations in remote, rural, or urban environments during peace or war.  During FY  1997  the Army  had  two  Special  Forces  groups, one Ranger regiment, one special operations aviation regiment, one active and two reserve PSYOP groups, and one active CA battalion and three reserve CA commands.

EUCOM  established  the  African  Crisis-Response Initiative, one peculiarly  SOF  mission,  to  prepare  African  nations  to  respond  within thirty  days  with  limited  peacekeeping or humanitarian  relief operations. [n  the  initiative, Special  Forces mobile training teams trained an  infantry battalion, combat support units, and combat service support units. Senegal and  Uganda received training in July 1997, with training planned for Mali, Malawi, Ethiopia, and Ghana  in  FY  1998.

When the mission in  Bosnia switched from  implementation force  to SFOR, Army SOF  participation  increased.  Special  operations  forces  in Bosnia are subordinate to  the SFOR through the Combined Joint Special Operations  Task  Force.  The  task  force  provides  a  Special  Operations

Command and Control Element to each Multinational Division to control SOF Joint Commission Observer Teams, which maintain communications between  all  factions  and  SFOR  commanders,  in  the  division's sector. Liaison  Coordination  Elements  work  for  the  multinational  battalions, providing  linguist support and  secure communications. The Joint Civil Military  Operations  Task  Force  provides  SFOR  with  a  civil-military capability  to  promote  cooperation  with  the  local  population,  agencies, and  national  government,  and  to  respond  to  humanitarian,  safety,  and health  emergencies. Through the Joint  Psychological Operations Force, PSYOP personnel provide SFOR with the capability of  supporting treaty implementation,  deterring  armed  resistance,  disposing  of unexploded munitions,  and  ending the  NATO  mission.  In  addition,  SOF  personnel attached to NATO and non-NATO units provide a rapid response capability, combat search and rescue, personnel recovery, and special reconnaissance. Each rotation in  support of  JotNT GuARD  included approximately 300 CA soldiers,  a  decrease  from FY 1996  in  JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  as  other NATO nations  have  provided  CA  assets.  A  CA  capability  in  JOINT  GuARD  is expected to continue until July 1998. At the end ofFY 1997, a total of 167 PSYOP soldiers were deployed in support of  JoiNT GUARD. Their numbers are anticipated to  increase in  FY  1998, and  their presence is  expected  to continue beyond the announced June  1998 end date of  the operation.

United States ambassadors and country teams rely on SOF expertise. In  1997 SOF deployed  to  l  44 countries, with a weekly average of  4,690 personnel on 303 missions to 69 countries. SOF personnel directly support an  embassy's objectives through  foreign  forces  training, joint exercises, humanitarian assistance, civic actions, demining programs, counterdrug programs,  counterterrorism,  noncombatant  evacuation  operations,  and military liaison teams. A survey of  sixty-five embassies indicated strong satisfaction  in  FY  I  997  with  the skills,  knowledge, and  performance of SOF personnel.  Supporting one embassy objective,  in  the PACOM area of responsibility, was JTF BEVEL  EDGE,  an  exercise designed to  plan for noncombatant evacuation operations from  Cambodia. With  one Special Forces  company  and  one special  operations  aviation  platoon  deployed to Thailand, the Army provided seventy-two personnel to  BE VEL  EDGE  in July  1997. Through the IRIS  GoLD exercise series conducted with Kuwaiti SOF, Army SOF personnel are present permanently  in Kuwait,  rotating one Special Forces company every 120 days. IRIS GoLD runs concurrently with  INTRINSIC ACTION and  takes  advantage  of training  opportunities available  in the  larger exercise.  During  IRIS  GoLD  97,  SOF  standardized the  close air support, communications, and  contingency  procedures for each  rotation.

SOF  personnel continued  to  support  the  U.S.  Support  Group-Haiti and  the  American  Embassy with  PSYOP,  CA,  and  Special  Forces teams

during  FY  1997.  A  PSYOP  Military  Information  Support Team,  on  its sixth  rotation of  personnel  from  the  United  States, is expected to continue to  provide support on  a  long-term  basis.  CA soldiers  from  a  Ministerial Advisory Team helped advance U.S. objectives with the Haitian govcrnn:lCnt  and assisted various  Haitian  ministries. The Special  Forces Command  (Airborne)  deployed  one  Special  Operations  command  and control element to support three assessment teams conducting analysis of eighteen remote sites.

In  the  PACOM  area,  SOF  supported  Operation PACIFIC  IJAVEN, the evacuation from  northern  Iraq of sixty-six  hundred  Kurds, many of  them employees  of the  U.S.  government  or  of U.S.-based  nongovernmental organizations.  From  September  1996  to  April 1997,  SOF  provided  a headquarters  support  team,  three  CA  tactical  support  teams,  and  one PSYOP military information support team.

SOF carried out a variety of other operations. CA personnel conducted thirteen  Professional  Development  Seminars  in  eleven South  American countries  and  supported  force  protection  and  antiterrorism  activities  in Saudi Arabia. Psychological operations personnel supported countcrdrug activities in Egypt, Cambodia, Thailand, and U.S. SOUTT   COM countries I and  conducted  demining  training  in  Eritrea, Ethiopia, Yemen,  Namibia, Mozambique,  Rwanda,  and  Guatemala.  Forty  SOF  soldiers  deployed to  Laos  and  Cambodia  to  conduct  medical  training,  leadership  courses, community awareness  programs,  and  demining  training  in  a  year-long program that began in October  1996.

Civilians are  an  increasingly  important element in  the  Army's force structure, principally performing logistics, maintenance, communications, intelligence, and mapping services and  working most often  in  equipment and  weapons  systems  maintenance.  A  new  Army  regulation  governing the use of U.S. citizens contracted to support or augment deployed Army forces is being written, and  Department of  the Army (DA) pamphlet 71516, Contractor Deployment  Guide, will  be  released  in  February  1 998. New  provisions  will  ensure  that  contractors  will  receive  standardized fie ld  support comparable  to  that  of soldiers,  particularly  with respect  to requirements, accountability,  and  deployment processing. Because some DA civilians and  contractors arc considered emergency essential  and are deployed more frequently than  in  the past to contingency locations, a new policy was developed  in FY  1 997 that addresses their carrying pistols and wearing  uniforms.  An  emergency  essential  DA  civilian  may  be  issued for self-defense a 9-mm.  or .45-calibcr pistol  with  standard ammunition, if authorized  by  the  theater commander,  and  will  be  required  to  wear a uniform.  Contractors are  not  excluded  from  being  issued  pistols,  but the practice is discouraged.  Contractors  may  be  issued  uniforms  but are  not required to wear them.

## Military IntelLigence

With  the  advances  in  computer  power  and  fiber  optics,  as  well  as the  increased application of space for intelligence purposes, the Army's military  intelligence  effort  has  been  revolutionized.  As  a  result  of the QDR and functional  area assessments, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff  for Intelligence (ODCSINT) remained confident in FY 1997lthat the Intelligence and Electronic jWarfare  Battlefield Operating System would retain  critical  capabilities  to  support  commanders  at every  echelon.  To achieve efficiencies at  every level, the Intelligence and Security Command and  the  U.S.  Army  Intelligence  Center and  School  are  analyzing every aspect of  Army intelligence. In one initiative, the final  draft of  Volume IV, Intelligence Support to  C2  Protect, of the Army C2 Protect Library was completed at the end ofFY 1997. Volume VI, Threats and Vulnerabilities, is  being updated  to  include  information operations and their capabilities. The Army  was  also  involved  in  the  first  National Intelligence  Estimate ever  dedicated  to  . information  warfare,  signifying  its  rising  importance to  the  national  defense.  Through  partnerships  with national,  DOD,  and Army  intelligence organizations; participation  in intelligence operations and experiments; and new initiatives, the Army will remain fully engaged in developing  information  warfare.  The  Army  also  participated  in  the intelligence  community's  efforts  to  define  and  develop the National Security  Agency's  Unified Cryptologic  Architecture and the Future Imagery  Arcbjtecture by leveraging  national capabilities to provide improved support to Army tactical intelligence.

The Task Force XXI AWE, which included the largest deployment of intelligence soldiers since Operation DESERT  STORM,  validated the Army Intelligence XXI  concept, intelligence architectme, and intelligence systems. Personnel fi· om military intelligence units provided intelligence collection  and  analysis  support for echelons above  division.  In  addition to  the  UAV,  which  provided  commanders  with  the  ability  to  see  the battlefield, the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Common  Suite provided unsurpassed signals intelligence. Using the Advanced Quickfix helicopter, the Guardrail Common Sensor, and heavy and light versions of the  Ground-Based  Conunon Sensor,  intelligence units  were able for  the first time to provide commanders with target intelligence based on accurate communications  interception and direction finding. The prototype of the Common Ground Station provided near-real-time downlinks from theater and  national  assets  to Task  Force  XXI,  displaying  the  information on a single screen, while the ASAS provided analysts with tools to  fuse sensor input into  an  intelligence  product.  The  introduction  of the  six-member Analysis and Control Team, which provides direct intelligence support to a maneuver brigade, created the first opportunity for commanders at brigade

and below  to  see the  battlefield  in  near real  time. The Land  Information Warfare Activity,  created  in  FY  1996  to  assess  friendly  vulnerabilities, collected  data against Task  Force  XXI  during  the AWE.  After analysis, the  data will  be used  to  assess  current and  future threats  to  Force XXI. The  Battlefield  Planning  and  Visualization  System  prototype  provided commanders  with  real-time,  high-resolution  data  overlaid  on  a  three› dimensional battlefield and  allowed them the ability to plan and rehearse their operations in a virtual environment.

Although the Army has been unable to portray intelligence in models and simulations  in  the  past,  DOD  is  now  providing funds  to  build  this capability.  ODCSINT was  engaged  in  FY  I  997  in  developing the Joint Simulations System, the Joint  Warfighter  Simulation System, the  Warfighter Simulation  System  (WARSIM)  2000,  the  WARSIM  2000  Intelligence Module, Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency  Training, and  the  Combat  Synthetic  Training  Assessment  Range.  At  the  same time, the Army was selected to  lead a joint intelligence effort to develop conceptual  models  for  all  military  intelligence  collection  systems  that will  be in  the field  in  FY 1999 or expected to be fielded  later.  During  FY 1997, the Army completed conceptual  models of nine Army intelligence collection  assets  and  draft  conceptual  models  for  the  remaining  three assets. These models will  be the basis for the software developed for the WARSJM 2000 Intelligence Module.

One  of greatest  strengths  of  military  intelligence is its linguist capability. The Army conducted a bottom-up review of  its foreign language capabilities  in  FY  1997. Towards  the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  numerous initiatives were undertaken to improve foreign language support. A General Officer  Steering  Committee  was  established to  review  and  manage  the actions from the review, as well as other language issues in the Army.

In another  assignment  for the military intelligence community, ODCSlNT  in  FY  1997  was  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  Army intelligence systems  were  year  2000 compliant.  This responsibility included all Army Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities and systems funded  by  the National Foreign Intelligence Program  in both the  active Army and the reserve components.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

The  Army  National  Guard's  (ARNG)  8  divisions, 15 Enhanced Separate  Brigades,  3  other  brigade-sized  combat  elements,  and  these units' associated  combat  support  and  combat  service  support  forces, are  assigned  to  missions  that  include  easing  active  Army personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO)  in peacetime operations, providing rotation forces  for  extended contingencies,  responding to  domestic emergencies, and  providing  a  deterrent to  destabilizing  international  forces.  Existing operations plans,  however,  do  not call for ARNG divisions to participate in major-theater wars. During the Cold War, ARNG divisions served as an important strategic reserve,  but with  the end of that conflict the  need  for a  large strategic  reserve  has  declined. T he  Quadrennial  Defense Review (QDR) considered  the  following  missions  for  ARNG  divisions:  protect rear-area  security  in  the  combat theater;  provide  replacements for  units deployed  to  small-scale  contingency  operations;  support  deployment of active Army units  and  mobilization  of  Enhanced Separate Brigades; and perform  state  missions.  The  secretary  of defense  approved  the  QDR's conclusion that these missions could be accomplished with a smaller U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) and ARNG.

Total Army Analysis 2003, one in a series of  biennial processes used to determine the force structure necessary to support warf1ghting commanders in chief  (CJNC) of  the unified combat commands, was conducted in  1995. Through the analysis, the Army determined that it required an additional 124,800 spaces  in  combat support and  combat  service  support  to  meet the National  Military  Strategy.  In May  1995  the  Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces recommended that reserve component forces with lower priority tasks be eliminated or reorganized to fill higher priority  shortfalls.  As  a  result  of the  Army  National  Guard  Division Redesign Study, which the secretary of the Army approved  in May 1996, during FYs 1999- 2012 ARNG is to convert up to twelve combat brigades and support elements from two divisions (47,300 combat positions) to the required  combat support and  combat service support structure.  Funding

was  approved  in  FY 1997 to  procure necessary equipment by  FY 2007, and  a  plan  to  implement the conversion  three  years  early,  by  FY  2009, is currently  being staffed. The original funding requirement of $4 billion was  amended  to  $5  billion  in  the  FY  s  1998- 2003  Program  Objective Memorandum, with $468 million allocated for ARNG, $192 million for USAR, and $83 million for the active Army.

Of the 45,000 troop reduction in the reserve components by  the end of FY  200 l  that  the  QDR  reconunended  and  the  secretary  of defense directed,  ARNG  is  required  to  decrease  its  personnel  by  38,000,  while USAR will  lose  7,000 soldiers.  As  a  result  of the  QDR,  changes  were made to the Total Force Policy, which focuses on the relevance of units to meet the National Military Strategy and the capability of  forces to perform across  the  spectrum of war.  Having determined  that some  of its  forces were  uncommittedbelonging  to the  strategic  reserve,  not  assigned missions, or designed for unique requirementsthe Army agreed  that a smaller force structure could  be achieved. These reductions will be taken primarily from the 66,432 ARNG and 6,298 USAR personnel categorized as  uncommitted  force  structure.  Total  Army  Analysis  2005,  held  in September  1997,  determined  the  standard  requirements  code  and unit identification code for  the reductions scheduled through FY 2000, which may ultimately affect units in 38 of  all 54 states and territories. Total Army Analysis 2007 will  later identify which force structure positions will  be eliminated during FYs 2001 - 02. The personnel reductions required by the secretary of  defense as a result of  the QDR are indicated in Table 26.

Table 26Reductions Under the Quadrennial Defense Review, Fiscal Years 1998- 2002

| Total               | 5,000              | 5,000              | 10,000             | 12,000             | 13,000             | 45,000  |

Despite  the  reduction  in  personnel,  ARNG  received  an  increase  in funding to pay its costs. The FY 1997 President's  Budget included requests for  $3.25  billion for National Guard  Personnel, Army  (NGPA),  and $2.2 billion for Operations and Maintenance, Army National Guard (OMNG). Congress increased the NGPA appropriation by $23.9 million for schools,

special  training,  and  basic  allowance for quarters.  Because  of increased operating tempo (OPTEMPO), the Department of  Defense transferred an additional $13 million  to ARNG. An additional congressional transfer of $125.8 million into NGPA for the counterdrug program resulted  in  a total obligation authority of$3.4 billion for NGPA. Congress also expanded the OMNG budget by $35.1 million for increased training operations, ground OPTEMPO,  and  depot  maintenance  and  $11  million  for  information management and  distance  learning. During FY  1997, an additional  $21 million  was  transferred  into  OMNG  from  the counterdrug program and $25.3 million from the Defense Environmental Restoration account. With $2.6  million  in  decreases  enacted  by  Congress,  OMNG  received  a  net increase of  $89.7 million and a total obligation authority of  $2.3 billion.

Although  416  units  with  29,443  spaces  were  inactivated  during FY  1997,  other force  structure actions  limited  the  reductions  to  10,606 spaces. ARNG  retained a  balanced structure of combat, combat support, and combat service support units,  while USAR became more focused on combat support,  combat service  support,  and  specialized  units. ARNG contained 57 percent of the Army's combat force with its 8 divisions, 15 Enhanced Separate Brigades (including one armored  cavalry regiment), 2  separate  brigades,  and  a  scout group.  At the  end  of FY  1997,  USAR provided 30 percent of all combat support units, 45 percent of  all combat service support units,  1  00 percent of  all  train ing  and  exercise  divisions, 100 percent of  all railway units, 100 percent of  all enemy prisoner-of-war brigades, 97 percent of  all civil affairs units, 86 percent of  all psychological operations (PSYOP) units, 70 percent of  all  medical units, and 62 percent of  all chemical and biological defense capability.

ARNG continued  in FY 1997  to  equip  its :fifteen Enhanced Separate Brigades,  which  began  a  transition  to  the  warfighting  structure  in  FY 1996. Expected to be fully operational by FY 1999, the Enhanced Separate Brigades will be organized and equipped to deploy within ninety days after mobilization and for compatibility with active Anny divisions. During FY 1997, the readiness level for the Enhanced Separate Brigades increased 5 percent owing to a 2 percent increase in qualified personnel, a  13  percent increase in equipment on hand, and a 2 percent increase in training. By the end  of FY 1999, the  Enhanced Separate Brigades will  have received  the MlAl Abrams tank and the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, as well  as Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) radios.

In  a renewed  commitment  to rely on  the  reserve components, DOD directed  the  military services to  integrate their active  and  reserve components  into  a  "seamless Total  Force."  ln  one  initiative,  the  Army designed composite units,  belonging to  USAR organizations,  composed of  soldiers from all Army components and other military services. Active Army and ful l-time support USAR personnel assigned to composite units

provide an immediate response cell during mobilization and deployment. In one composite unit, the 31 Oth Chemical Company (Biological Integrated Detection), four platoons, the company headquarters, and support elements belong to USAR, while one operational platoon belongs to the active Army. In another example, USAR's 3d Medical Command includes twenty-nine activeAnny and two hundred USAR positions. The  Army intends to expand the number of  composite units in the future, particularly in combat service support,  filling  subordinate  elements  with  USAR soldiers  and  critical individual requirements with active Army personnel. By using composite units, the active Army estimates it will be able to transfer some missions to USAR and reduce its force structure by six thousand positions.

In  another  initiative,  as  part of the  Army  National  Guard  Division Redesign Study, the Training and Doctrine Comand (TRADOC) examined the concept of creating two Active C0mponent/Army National Guard  Integrated  Divisions  to  increase  integration  between  the  active and  reserve  components  and  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the  Army's earliest and  latest deploying units.  Each composite division, a multistate organization, would consist of  an active Army division headquarters, not currently scheduled to  deploy in time of war or crisis, and three ARNG Enhanced Separate Brigades,  the  principal  combat  maneuver  forces  of the  Army's reserve  components.  Once  formed,  the  integrated  division would be a new deployable force, either as a complete unit or as individual Enhanced Separate Brigades. The Forces Command (FORSCOM) leads the Implementation Process Action Team  in  developing the  plan,  which will be presented to the Secretary ofthe Army in December 1997, to form the integrated divisions.

USAR is the most utilized reserve component in all of  DOD, providing 71 percentofallreservecomponentdeploymentsforJOrNTGUARD. Following a review of  wartime staffing, the Joint Staff  created Joint Reserve Units to integrate personnel into unified command staffs to meet wartime mission requirements.  The  Army  contributes  active  ARNG/USAR  personnel, individual  mobilization  augmentees  (IMA),  and  Troop  Program  Unit soldiers to the Joint Reserve Units. Of the  1,940 USAR soldiers deemed necessary to  serve  in  Joint Reserve Units, 350  were in  the U.S. Atlantic Command, 373  in  the  U.S.  European  Command  (EUCOM),  530  in  the U. S.  Pacific  Command  (PACOM),  311  in  the  U.S.  Central  Command (CENTCOM), 192 in the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), l 09 in the U.S. Special Operations Command, 1 in the Strategic Command, 34 in the Space Command, and 40 on the Joint Staff.

ln planning to  meet two  nearly  simultaneous major-theater wars, the Army provides tiered  funding,  personnel,  training, and equipment to  its units on  a "first to fight"  basis. Tier  1 units,  which  include  force support package (FSP)  units, special operations support package units, CONUS

support  package units, and early deployers, are  highly trained, first to receive resources,  and  ready  to  deploy  by  dates  designated in  CINC  operations plans. To ensure that Tier  1  units  are at a  high state of readiness  at all times,  the Army provides them with  100 percent funding  for Operations and  Maintenance,  Army  Reserve;  100  percent  fill  of full-time  support personnel;  high  priority  for  tra ining  school  allocations;  and  equipment enhancements. Tier 2 tmits and lower receive resources that coincide with their  mobilization  missions  or their  position  on  major  operations  plan time-phased force deployment data lists.

FSP  1 units  support  4-'h divisions,  1  full  corps  headquarters,  and 1 theater slice  (elements of a  theater army); and  FSP 2  uni.ts  support 1 division,  1 partial  corps  headquarters,  and  1 theater-opening slice.  The Total Army has  1,134 FSP units,  with 363 coming from  USAR and 209 fi·om ARNG. In  FY  1997 a 3  percent decline in  FSP  readiness occurred because of a  2  percent  decline  in  the  number of qualified  soldiers  and a  3  percent decline  in  equipment  on  hand  (owing  to  reorganization  or modernization). Four FSP ARNG units are deployed currently in support of JoiNT GuARD.  The newly  formed  contingency support package  (CSP) consists of a  minimum number of deployment support units  required to deploy FSP L  units or 4-'h  divisions. Of  the Total Army's 69 CSP units, 60 belong to USAR and 6 to the active Army.

To  economize,  the  Army  has  devised  an  Associate Transportation Company (ATC). In peacetime, "truckless" truck companies in USAR will be formed with a full complement of  personnel and, for training purposes, with  vehicles  to  equip  one  platoon.  When  unit  training  is  necessary, personnel  will  use  vehicles  belonging  to  a  comparable  truck  company located  in  their  geographical  area  or  wil l  borrow  the  vehicles.  During wartime or in response to a regional contingency, personnel from selected active  Army  truck  companies  wi ll be  deployed  without  their  vehicles, drawing  pre-positioned  trucks  and  equipment  at  their  arrival  location. After mobilization, a truckless truck company will assume responsibility for  the equipment left behind  by the deployed active Army unit, arriving in theater 15  to 45 days after the conflict or contingency begins. The Army is  in the process of  activating its first truckless truck company in FY  1998 and  expects  to  have  three  units  operational by  October 2003. The ATC concept is  expected  to  reduce  costs  for  truck  units,  make  better use  of available  equipment on hand,  and eliminate the need for complete truck fleets in both the active Army and USAR. .

## Strength and Personnel Management

At the  end  of FY  1997,  the  end-strength  objective  for  ARNG  was 367,000  personnel.  With  370,046  soldiers  on the roster,  ARNG  had

achieved 100.8 percent of  its objective. The total strength included 40,756 officers  and  329,290  enlisted  personnel.  With  an  attrition rate  of nearly 11  percent, the number of officers  had  declined  by  1,078 since FY 1996 and was below ARNG's objective for FY 1997. Of9,732 warrant officers authorized, only 8,171  were assigned. To increase the number of officers, Congress authorized the Army National Guard Combat Reform Initiative, which allows selected active Army lieutenants to separate from active duty for assignment to a ARNG unit.

To  improve  personnel  strength,  ARNG  consolidated  two  military occupational specialties (MOS), those of recruiter and retainer (someone who worked to retain soldiers in the force), into a new MOS called strength maintenance. This action, coupled with aggressive high school recruiting programs,  the  conduct  of  training  to improve  strength  maintenance, and  selected  reserve  incentive  programs,  enabled  ARNG  to  exceed  its accession goal of 59,262 enlisted personnel  by  1  07 percent in FY 1997. Of ARNG's 63,495  accessions,  28,378  (106.4  percent  of the objective) were nonprior service (NPS) and 35,117 (107.7 percent of the objective) were prior service. During the same period, 62,349 personnel left ARNG and  41,957 reenlisted.  Of the  latter,  11,185 soldiers had  completed their first term of  en listment and 30,772 were career soldiers.

Eighteen  percent  of all  full-time  military  personnel  in  USAR were engaged  in  recruiting  efforts  during  FY 1997,  a  program  funded  by $30  million.  Less  than  l  percent  of USAR  soldiers  were  involved  in retention  efforts, however, and USAR experienced an  attrition  rate more than  30 percent. USAR is currently studying methods to  reduce its  high attrition and  to  improve  its  recruiting methods,  focusing  on  eliminating redundancies  and  creating  efficiencies.  In  one  initiative,  the  UASR has deployed contractor personnel to Europe to offer USAR opportunities to soldiers leaving active duty. The Selected Reserve Incentive Program for FY 1997 offered a $2,500 enlistment bonus for NPS accessions into high› priority  units,  a  $5,000 civilian-acquired  skills  program  bonus  for  NPS accessions, a $2,500 reenlistment/extension bonus, a  bonus for enlistees with a remaining military service obligation, and a student loan repayment program for NPS enlistees.

Educational  programs remained a strong incentive in  recruiting and retaining soldiers, lowering the attrition rate by 3 percent in FY 1997. More than  11 ,000 ARNG soldiers received  tuition assistance, which provides 75 percent of the cost for college courses, during FY  1997.  During the year ARNG offered a one-time reimbursement fee of$75 for soldiers who obtained an evaluation for possible college course credit of  their military education  and  training,  their  previous college credits,  and  any  college› level  examination  scores. The soldiers  also  received  a  degree  plan  for obtaining an associate's or bachelor's  degree through the External Degree

program.  In  a  specific  mltlatlvc  to  enhance  recruiting  and  retention, 1\.RNG administered free College Level Examination Program and other standardized  tests  to  soldiers  and  their spouses.  The  Service-members Opportunity  Colleges,  which  support  their  local  ARNG  communities by  limiting residency requirements to 25 percent of  the required courses for soldiers, worked with ARNG throughout the fiscal  year to enroll new accredited  colleges  and  universities  in  the  program.  The  Montgomery G.l. bill remained  another  educational incentive, offering a soldier about $7,500 for undergraduate, graduate,  vocational, or flight  training after  completion  of a  six-year enlistment.  ARNG  also  provided  Army Distance Learning and External  Degree programs to soldiers to obtain a baccalaureate or graduate degree at their home station,  reimbursing the soldiers for up  to 75 percent of  their cost for courses they completed.

As  combat  arms  forces  shifted  to  ARNG,  and  USAR  focused  on executing combat support and combat service support missions, the Active Guard Reserve (AGR) program needed to be reorganized to meet changing requirements.  Under  the  AGR,  trained  active  or  reserve  component soldiers can apply for active duty, full-time positions in ARNG or USAR to  organize, administer,  recruit,  instruct, and train  selected reserve  units and personnel, retaining the same benefits as active Army counterparts. To ensure advancement opportunities  in  the AGR, the Career  Management Decision  Support Model  was  developed  to  provide officers  in  the  right skills  and  quantities. ARNG  is  currently  seeking to  increase  promotion opportunities for career AGR enlisted  and officer personnel,  which will provide subsequent promotion opportunities for junior personnel.

To provide a cadre of  military technicians and AGR soldiers to perform most daily operations in the reserve components, Congress established the Full-Time  Support  Program.  Personnel  requirements  for  the  Full-Time Support  Program  are  determined  by  analyzing  the  workloads  of staffs in  training  support,  recruiting,  maintenance, and readiness  management work centers, while pay grades are decided on the basis of classification studies.  Congress provides full-time support authorization levels through the National Defense Authorization Act to states and territories based on the  philosophy of providing  resources  to  those  units  that will  be first  to fight.  As a result,  a greater percentage of full-time support personnel  are ass. ig ncd  to FSP units and Enhanced Separate Brigades. Only 9 percent of all USAR personnel  are full-time support, the lowest level of any  DOD reserve component and one that will decrease as authorizations for full› time support personnel decline throughout the military. ARNG, with 13.3 percent full-time support personnel in its force, has the second-lowest level. Full-time support composes  17.2  percent of the Marine Corps Reserve, 23.1  percent of the Air Force Reserve, 26.1  percent of the Navy Reserve, and 31.5 percent of  the Air National Guard.

Equipment  modernization  and more  contingency missions have increased  the  need for military  technicians,  particularly  to  maintain complex new equipment. Congress authorized 22,798 AGR soldiers and 25,500 military technicians for ARNG  in  FY  1997. As of 30 September 1997,  a  total  of 22,655  of the  former  and  24,689  of the  latter  were assigned, less than authorized strength in both categories, with significant reductions  programmed  for  the  future.  Even  with  nearly  all  authorized positions filled,  however, the AGR could meet only 62 percent of  all valid requirements. Of  the 44, L  1.5  validated military technician requirements in ARNG, only 56 percent were fi lled;  fu rthermore, ARNG must eliminate 2,000 military technicians by the end ofFY 200 I. To achieve the reduction in AGR authorization  levels required  by  Congress, the Temporary Early Retirement Authority was used  in FY  1997  to  provide $14.2  million  in transition  benefits  to  support the  early  retirement of 260  soldiers. With additional decreases  of 488  and 930 personnel scheduled for FYs  1998 and  1999,  respectively,  and  continued reductions  during  FYs  2000- 02, funding of  the Temporary Early Retirement Authority will be essential.

Under the  Reserve Associate Support Program, which  began  in  FY 1997 with I 00 USAR soldiers, USAR is working to improve its warfighting capabilities at the same time that it  helps to reduce shortfalls  in the active Army.  Soldiers  who  enlisted  under  the  program  completed  their  initial entry training in USAR and were then assigned to active Army units for the remainder of  a two-year training obligation. During the active duty period, the soldiers will complete Skill Level l training tasks before being assigned to a USAR  unit, where they will serve an additional. four years. This program will  improve  USAR readiness  by providing it with soldiers who are fully trained in critical skills and can be assigned to force package units.

In  another program, called Active Duty Special Work, ARNG brings individuals on active duty to  perform special  projects such as  command and staff visits, annual medical and dental screenings, training operations, new  weapons  systems  conversions,  studies,  training  site  and  exercise support, mission support, development of course curricula and  software, and administrative  support. During  FY J 997,  1,340  ARNG  soldiers participated in Active Duty Special Work.

Reengineering of  personnel support continued during FY  1997, as the U.S.  Army  Reserve  Pers01mel  Command  prepared  to  replace  the Army Reserve Personnel Center  in  FY 1998, consolidating personnel management functions  from  four  agencies  into  one.  Through  new  work  processes and  enhanced  technology,  the  new  command  will  decrease civilian and mi  itary  personnel  positions  by  five  hundred.  The  personnel  electronic I record  management system, which converts paper and microfiche records to electronic data and permits instantaneous access to  records by multiple users,  was  initiated  in  FY  1996  and  completed in  FY  1997. In  addition,

an  integrated  workstation  was  created  that  combines  word  processing, electronic forms,  and other services to  improve customer service. During FY 1997, ten special staff  projects on personnel were completed, in addition to  studies  of unique  and  specialized organizations,  such  as  the  National Interagency Counterdrug Institute,  the Aviation Classification and  Repair Activity Depots, and the Operational  Support Airlift Command.

The Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act, the first major change in rcscrvcofficerpersonnelmanagernent  in forty-twoyears, bccameeffective on I  October  1 996,  consolidating  laws  governing  reserve  components; streamlining  reserve  officer  promotions,  tenure,  and  separations;  and standardi7.ing active and reserve component officer management as much as possible. Time-in-service requirements for promotion were eliminated, a  best-qualified  policy  for  promotion  replaced  that  of  fully qualified, promotions based on position vacancies were eliminated except in special cases, and promotion confirmation by the Senate was eli1ninatcd below the rank of  colonel. Promotion for second lieutenants after serving twenty-four months in grade was authorized, while accelerated promotions for serving in  a captain's position  were eliminated.  A requirement was  instituted for an  officer above the rank of major  to  have three  years' time  in  grade  to retire voluntarily,  but only six  months if involuntarily retired.  Mandatory retirement  was  announced  for  colonels  with  30  years  of commissioned service  and  lieutenant  colonels  with  28  years;  involuntary  separation would  occur for officers  below  the  rank  of lieutenant  colonel  who  were not selected for promotion on  two occasions. ARNG  worked  in  FY  1997 to  retain  the a  bit ity  to  promote officers on  the traditional  date recognized by states and to keep state promotion eligibility for lieutenant colonels not selected for promotion by a mandatory promotion board.

## Training and Readiness

To support the shift in the National  Military Strategy from full to partial mobilization  planning,  the Total  Army Training  System  created  USAR division (institutional training) (DIVlT) and division (exercise) (DlVEX). Seven  DIVITs  provide  initial  entry  training,  one-station  unit  training, MOS qualification and refresher training, and professional development traini ng.  The  professional  development  training  includes  the  Primary Leadership Development Course, the Advanced Noncommissioned Officer Course, the Combined Arms and Services Staff School, and  the Command  and  General Staff Officers  Course. During  the  year,  USAR prepared  for an expanded mission  to conduct Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC)  basic and  advanced summer camps.  In  addition,  USAR soldiers  from  DJVITs  will  begin  serving  as  ROTC  instructors at  three universities in  fall  1997 in a trial program. Five DIVEXs usc lane-training

techniques to  improve the  tactics and  technical skills of u11its. They also use  the  Brigade  Command  and  Battle Staff Training  program  to  plan, conduct, and execute staff training for combined arms, combat support, and  combat service support units.  During FY 1997,  DIVEXs provided lane training to 405 reserve component units and Brigade Command and Battle StaffTraining to 167 units.

The training strategy in the reserve components focuses on premobilization  and  postmobilization.  To  take  better  advantage  of the personnel  structure  within  the  active  and  reserve  components,  a  new training  organization  is  being  established.  As  of 1  October  1997,  an interim training organization will consolidate all  active Army personnel who provide training support to reserve component units into battalions assigned to training support brigades that belong to the CONUS armies. In  addition,  the  regional training  detachments  for  ARNG  Enhanced Separate Brigades are  being  reassigned  from  the  active Army  division with which they were associated to the training support brigades. Although the  DIVTTs  and  DIVEXs  will  be  retained  through  FY  1999,  the Army is  preparing for a  significant change in  FY 2000.  Beginning  1 October 1999, five training support divisions, which will be completely integrated active component/reserve component organizations, will be formed from USAR's five DIVEXs to dedicated training support to all components of the Total Army.

ARNG completed full implementation  of  the  Total Army School  System (TASS)  in  FY  1997, with elements operational  in each of the fifty-four states and territories.  Of the 41,594 soldiers not available for deployment at the end ofFY 1997, a . total of27,087 were engaged in required training, an  increase  in  training  of 5  percent since  the  end  of FY  1996. ARNG, active  Army,  and  USAR  have  signed  a  memorandum  of understanding to  facilitate  support  between  components  for  TASS  schools.  TASS  is shifting  fi·om  a  reliance  on  traditional  institutional  training  to  distance learning. Through the Army Distance Learning Program, TASS, and the Total  Army  Training  System,  standardized  training  is  being  established for all  components, redundant training is being eliminated, and resources are  being  used  more  efficiently.  Training  links  have  been  established between  proponent  schools, TASS  sites,  and  ARNG  armories,  with 32 distance learning classrooms opened in FY 1997. By the end ofFY 1998, 204 distance  learning classrooms will be operational, and,  by  the end of FY  1999,  a  total  of 600.  After providing each soldier with a  classroom within an  hour's drive,  the Army will  begin  to  extend  distance  learning into soldiers' homes through electronically deliverable training  products. ARNG is presently providing training developers and funds to supplement the efforts of  proponent schools to redesign paper-based courses into ones that can be presented electronically.

The  Multi  Media  Branch  at  Fort  Rucker,  Alabama,  remained  one of ARNG's premier distance  learning  centers  in  FY  1997.  With  unique capabilities in aviation and safety training, visual information, and education, the Multi Media Branch, which has supported ARNG for twenty-five years, has developed a state-of-the-art distance learning broadcast studio that uses satellite technology to transmit its courses. During the fiscal year, the Multi Media  Branch  provided  MOS  reclassification  training  through  distance learning for ARNG soldiers transferring into air traffic control. In support of ARNG's  safety  program, theMultiMedia  Branch  produced visual information products  on  aeromedical research,  industrial hygiene,  occupational  safety and health, risk management, and radiological protection.

The  Visual Information Support  Center  (VISC) in Nashville,  Tennessee, however, with 2,000 visual information products, possesses ARNG's  largest selection. It is  ARNG's production center for various  visual  information products,  including regional  multimedia  imaging,  banners,  posters,  and duplication  of videotapes  and  compact  disks. The VISC,  composed  of personnel with audio,  video, scripting, editing, and graphic design skills, created products  in  FY  1997  on  recruiting and  retention,  drug  demand reduction, public affairs, and other subjects for various DOD agencies and state organizations. In addition to  producing  training and  public  service announcements, the VlSC also documented a variety of  ARNG events and provided audiovisual support to  training courses, workshops, and disaster relief efforts.  During the  fiscal  year,  thirteen states  received  funding  to purchase digital photography systems for official Department of  the Army photos, increasing ARNG's  employment of  visual information technology. Since FY 1994, when the Environmental Protection Agency directed that federal agencies terminate chemical photo processing, twenty-two states have obtained this funding.

During the fiscal year, ARNG initiated several new training  management procedures.  The  Training,  Readiness,  and  Operations,  Unit  Planning, Execution, and Resourcing System aligns unit training plans with state and national  training goals, defines  funded and unfunded  training plans, and identifies  funds  made available by  changes to  plans.  Through  the  Army Training Resource and Requirement System  Funding Allocation Model, ARNG training resource managers are able to determine the training costs for an individual soldier to attend a certain course at  a specific training site. ARNG  is  also  developing the  lnstitutionaJ Training  Resource Model  to identify operating costs associated with a particu  Jar program of  instruction at a given tra ining site. During FY 1997 ARNG began to develop a training requirements  generator  to  assist  in identifying  training  requirements during the Structure Manning Decision Review and budgeting processes. The program will  be operational in FY 1998. Although ARNG improved its  management of  available  training course slots for NPS enlistees in FY

1997, it continued to work with TRADOC and U.S. Total Army Personnel Command tlu·ough the Training Requirements Arbitration  Panel process to obtain the right training for its soldiers at the appropriate time. To track and  adjust its  utilization  of school  training  quotas, ARNG  implemented tbe Training Utilization Model.

To provide combat training for all  of its  units, ARNG developed  the combat training center (CTC) integrated training strategy during FY I  997. The strategy incorporates every CTC programNational Training Center (NTC),  Combat  Maneuver  Training  Center  (CMTC),  Joint  Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Battle Command Training Program (BCTP), and Brigade  Command  and  Battle  Staff Trainingand  Division  Warfighter Exercises. Aligning ARNG divisions, combat support, and combat service support with  the  Enhanced  Separate  Brigades, ARNG  has  integrated  its training  program  among  the  three  training  domains  over  an  eight-year cycle,  during  which  maneuver  and  gunnery  training  will  be  conducted along with individual and crew training. Under the BCTP, fourteen ARNG brigades  and  two  ARNG  divisions  participated  in  Division  Warfighter Exercises,  constructive simulations  that provided  commanders and  staffs the opportunity to synchronize battlefield tasks through the application of computer technology, saving the costs associated with a full  live exercise. In  an  effort  to  use  available  resources  to  train  lower-priority  units,  the Battle  Focused  Training  Experiment  was  conducted  in  August  1997  at the Training  and Training Technology Battle Lab at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Using  aggressive  opposing forces  and  observer-controllers  in a  training scenario  that  focused  on  muJtiechelon  and  individual  training,  the  battle lab created an experience similar to a CTC rotation. To augment the NTC support battalion, ARNG provided ten maintenance units during FY 1997 for general support and direct support maintenance.

To  provide better training at a  much lower cost, ARNG is  procuring additional  training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations, and linking simulators and simulations to support a common synthetic theater of  war. Through the interactive synthetic theater of war, soldiers and leaders will receive coaching and feedback throughout the training scenario. Simulators have  been  used so  successfully  in ARNG  armor and  cavalry  units  that the  technology  has  been  expanded  to  encompass  infantry  and  cavalry units  possessing  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicles.  During  FY  1997,  ARNG developed and tested the Full-crew Interactive Simulation Trainer- Bradley prototype.  In  addition, the following  simulation systems were procured and fielded  during  the fiscal  year:  7  Engagement  Skill Trainers,  with a mix of simulated crew-served weapons;  54 Armor-Full-crew Interactive Simulations Trainers; 20 JANUS staff/maneuver trainers; 29 Guard Unit Full-crew Interactive Simulation Trainer-II forward observer trainers; and 10 Digital Systems Test and Training Simulators  for  field  artillery units.

ARNG also provided support for the successfully completed Mobile-Close Combat Tactical Trainer Limited Users Test.

In support  of  training requirements for the Enhanced  Separate Brigades, ARNG continued  its  Unit Training Initiative in FY 1997. Five ARNG divisions provided twelve battalion task forces to serve as opposing forces against eight Enhanced Separate Brigades during FORSCOM lane training exercises, increasing the opportunity for realistic training for both the  Enhanced  Separate Brigades and  the  divisional  units.  In  addition  to delineating  which  divisions  provided  battalion  task  forces,  identifying division  locations,  noting  the  Enhanced  Separate Brigade  supported  by each  division,  and  providing  the  locations  of each  Enhanced  Separate Brigade, Table  27 demonstrates  the  wide  scope  of geographical  areas engaged in such programs.

ARNG and  USAR soldiers were  both  heavily  involved  in  exercises during  FY 1997,  both  in CONUS  and  overseas. USAR  supported RoviNG.  SANDS  with  15,594 soldiers;  3,655  soldiers  were rotated  through NTC;  and  another  3,512  through  JRTC,  including  aviation  persoru1el. Throughout the fiscal  year, USAR deployed 11 ,091  soldiers to 50 nations to  participate  in  various  military  exercises.  In  HEAVEN  STOR M,  soldiers from  USAR's 555th  Quartermaster  Platoon  (Mortuary Affairs),  located in  Dover, Delaware, deployed to Puerto Rico  in  July to engage in a joint training exercise  for  military  morticians. The  exercise  also  included  the active Army's 54th Quartermaster Company from Fort Lee, Virginia, and USAR's 246th Quartermaster  Battalion,  331 st Quartermaster  Company (Mortuary Affairs), and 55 1st Quartermaster Company (Mortuary Affairs) from Puerto Rico.  During HEAVEN  STORM,  mortuary specialists processed simulated casualties in a mock chemical environment.

A total of23,  163 ARNG soldiers deployed overseas for training during FY  1997. Nearly half, or 10,856, were sent to U.S. SOUTHCOM; 8,274 to EUCOM; 2,680 to PACOM; 1,226 to the Atlantic Command; and  127 to CENTCOM. ARNG readiness levels increased 3 percent during FY 1997, with a 4 percent increase in  personnel  readiness,  a 4 percent  increase in equipment on hand, a 2 percent increase in  equipment readiness, and  a 1 percent increase in training. With two ARNG divisions reaching the highest readiness level in FY 1997, all ARNG divisions were at the highest level. ARNG sent 1,044 soldiers to Europe to train with active Army elements in BCTP and CMTC exercises. In addition to three company exchanges with the United Kingdom and Germany that provided training and fami  iarization I with allied military  doctrine and tactics,  thirteen ARNG  officers, as part of the Individual Exchange Program, were assigned to British or German military  units during their two  weeks of annual  training. The  Minnesota Army  National  Guard,  which  had  established  a  formal  unit  exchange program with the Norwegian National Guard in FY  1996, sent a company to Norway in FY  1997 to train  in  winter warfare operations. In NORTIIE RN VIKING 97, 400ARNG soldiers from New York and Pennsylvania deployed to  Iceland  to participate in  an Atlantic Command joint exercise designed to test air defenses, ground operations, and force protection capabilities of the Iceland Defense Force and  U.S. forces in Iceland and the Azores.

In  the  Pacific  theater,  ARNG  personnel  deployed  to  South  Korea, Japan, Malaysia,  and Thailand in  support of JCS  (Joint Chiefs of Staff) exercises  FOAL  EAGLE,  FREQUBNT  STORM,  ULCHJ Focus  LENS,  KEEN  EoGE, NoRTHWIND, and ConR A Gow. As it does each year, ARNG deployed 2,300 soldiers to conduct CASCADE PEAK, a computer simulation exercise that was part of YAMA  SAKURA,  a JCS-directed  exercise. ARNG also sent Special Forces medics to the Central  Identification Laboratory in Hawaii to support the  identification of remains from  Southeast Asia.  As an example of the

support that ARNG provided  for  foreign military sales around the world, the Texas Army National Guard provided CH-47D helicopter training and ai rcraft support to the Republic of  Singapore.

ARNG  sent soldiers  to  U.S.  SOUTHCOM to  participate  in  the  JCS exercises Nutwos  HoRtZONTiiS J  997 (Belize), Nuevos  HoRt7.0N1TiS 1997 (Panama), and FuERZAS Dt:FHNSAS (Defense Forces). During these exercises, ARNG  personnel  built  roads  and  worked  on  nation  assistance  projects in  Panama,  Guyana,  Costa  Rica,  and  Belize. In addition,  seven  medical readiness-training  exercises  took  place  in  Guatemala,  Ecuador,  Costa Rica,  Guyana,  and  Belize,  with  210  ARNG  soldiers  providing  medical care, dental care, and preventive medicine for local  inhabitants. A total of 498  Special  Forces soldiers  from  ARNG  participated  in  Joint Combined Exchange  Training  in  Belize,  Bolivia,  Venezuela,  Ecuador,  I  londuras, Panama, and Surinam. ARNG personnel also conducted assessment visits, traveling contact team visits, and fami liarization tours to Belize, Ecuador, and Panama through the State Partnership Program, emphasi7.ing aviation support and search and rescue operations. The program will expand in  FY 1998, with four new nations. As occurs annually, 500 ARNG soldiers from Puerto Rico deployed to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Barbados in  the Snlall  Unit Program. Another 650 ARNG soldiers deployed during the fiscal  year to Panama to attend the Jungle Operations Training Center.

Within CONUS, in another annual cxercise,ARNG soldiers participated in  GOI..DEN  CARGO,  which  was  initiated  to  assist  in  the  consolidation  of missions under the Industrial Operations Command. Through DEEP LooK, ARNG units participated in joint training from their home stations through computer  data  links,  focusing  on interoperability  with other  military services  without incurring any  deployment costs.  ARNG  personnel also improved  intcroperability  by  training  with Alaskan-based  forces  in  JCS exercises CorE THUNDER and NORTIIERN Edge. Through medical  innovative readiness  training  projects,  ARNG  medical  personnel  provided  health care  to  72,000  civilians in economically,  socially,  or  geographically disadvantaged  communities  in  twenty-two  states  during  FY 1997.  The program will  be expanded to thirty or thirty-five states in  FY  1998.

## Mobilization

The Army Mobilization Operation Planning and Execution System› planning and  preparation,  alert,  home  station,  mobilization  station, and port of  embarkationsets the objectives for mobilizing reserve component units  in  five  phases.  Depending  on  the  size  of the  reserve  component unit,  arrival  at  the  port  of embarkation  for  travel  to  a  contingency  area or theater of  operations is expected  to take place  15 to 91  days following mobilization, as depicted in Table 28.

Table 28Mobilization Objectives for Reserve Component Units

*M is mobilization day.

Members of the Selected Reserve  may  be mobilized for  a  period  of 270 days under the presidential selected reserve call-up (PSRC), which  is authorized under Title I 0 of the United States Code. Most of the reserve component units  mobilized  under  PSRC  for  JoiNT  ENDEAVOR  and  JorNT GuARD  served  the  270  days  allowed  by  J aw,  although  reservists  filling medical positions in United States Army, Europe (USAREUR), to replace personnel deployed to Bosnia were activated for only 140 days. During FY 1997, backfilling of USAREUR positions ended as reserve medical  units were  mobilized  for  270 days  and sent directly  to  Bosnia to  replace  the rotating medical units.

The Individual Ready Reserve remained a significant element in the Total Army's ability to  respond to a contingency. Of  the 320,000 members ofthe Individual Ready Reserve in FY 1997, a total of  25,000 had served on active duty within the previous 24 months.  The Army identifies soldiers who  have been on active duty  in  the  last  1 2,  18,  or 24 months and  rei  ies upon  them  to  fill  individual  requirements  or  replace  casualti. es  in  time of war. With  such  recent active~duty experience,  these  soldiers  usually require  very  little  postmobilization  training  before  being  deployed  to  a theater of  operations.  To  improve flexibility and increase access to soldiers with critical  MOSs,  the  pending National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  1998 would allow the mobilization of  30,000 members of  the Individual  Ready Reserve  under the  PSRC.  Such a  measure would also eliminate  the  inefficiency  of activating several  units,  each containing an insufficient  number of soldiers  with  critical skills,  and  combining their personnel resources for a contingency.

Persons  designated  as  lMAs  are  assigned  to  positions  in  advance of mobilization and can be mobilized  under PSRC. Two  thousand  were mobi lized  for  JOINT  ENDEAVOR  and  JOlNT  GuARD. Of the II  ,362 lMAs

authorized  in  USAR  in  FY  1997, a  total  of 921  participated  in  annual training with  their  predetermined  active Army  unit.  TMAs  provide  the Army with  its only capability  to  provide predetermined individual staff reinforcements or the ability to expand in response to ClNC requirements. In addition to proposing  that  the IMA  pool be  expanded,  USAR developed a proposal in  FY  1997  to  use a  two-tiered  IMA program  to meet CINC and Army component requirements. IMA soldiers mobilized under PSRC will be members of  the Selected Reserve, while soldiers not required  until  after  partial  or fu ll  mobilization  wi ll  be  members  of the fndividual  Ready  Reserve. This  plan  will  provide an  increased  role for individuals, a  higher  level  of flexibility, and  increased  OPTEMPO  and PERSTEMPO savings. Through a combination of PSRC mobilizations, annual training, and inactive duty for training, reserve components were able to  offset 8  million  man-days  of active Army  PERSTEMPO  in  FY 1997, reducing operational costs. The Army also engaged in  FY  1997 in a plan  to  combine  IMA office personnel, USAR support hospitals, and installation  medical support  units  into  one organization  to  support an active Army installation hospital. Such an integrated organization would increase the installation's  ability to provide health care and would reduce medical costs.

During FY  1997, a total of 6,948  reserve component soldiers (2,354 ARNG; 4,536 USAR; and 58 IMAs) were mobilized  in support of JOINT ENDilAVOR  and  JOINT  GuARD.  The  majority  of units  deployed  to  Bosnia provided civil  affairs, PSYOP, public affairs, firefighting,  military history, rear  area operations,  military  police,  aviation,  and infantry  support. Additional reserve component personnel augmented or backfilled USAREUR staffs and  units  in  Germany,  contributing  postal,  movement control, public affairs, military intelligence, finance,  and personnel administration support. A small number of reserve component units were activated to support CONUS mobilization stations and to backfill deployed units.  Since the beginning of  JOINT ENDE AVOR  in  December 1995, a total of 15,074 soldiers (4,503 AP-NG;  10,164  USAR; and 407  !MAs) have been mobilized  from  465  reserve component units to support the operation  in Bosnia and Hungary.

ARNG soldiers also deployed  in  support ofTask  Force AoLE SENTRY as part of  the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force in Macedonia. An ARNG combat support/combat service support slice, consisting of  65 soldiers  from  Colorado,  Illinois, and  Missouri, deployed to  Macedonia  in August  1997 as  part  of the  1st Armored  Division's Task  Force  1 - 6. The deployed  soldiersmilitary  police,  aviation,  and  engineer  personnel› will  be  replaced  in  January  or  February  1998  by  a  new  element  of 52 soldiers.  An  additional  3,090  ARNG  soldiers  were  deployed  to  Europe in  support of the  USAREUR  Equipment Maintenance  Program  and  the

Combat Equipment Group-Europe,  while  170  stationed at  Camp  Darby, Italy, provided maintenance support for Army war reserve equipment.

Under its State Partnership Program, ARNG participated in EUCOM's Joint Contact Team Program, presenting a role  model  of a military force subject  to  civilian  authority  for Central  European  and  former  Soviet Union  countries. Through  the program, ARNG  personnel  taught military members of  partner countries how to provide support to civi  ian authorities I during civil  emergencies and  natural  disasters  and  offered  assistance  on recruiting, retention, reserve training, mobilization, building a professional noncommissioned  officer  corps,  and  engineering exercises.  During  FY 1997, ARNG sent traveling contact teams, seminar participants, and state adjutant generals and governors to visit partner countries in Central Europe and the  former Soviet Union, as well as  hosting  134 familiarization  tours within CONUS.  Approximately 390 ARNG soldiers deployed to participate in  1 98  events in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, the Republic of  Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. The cost of  the program was $17.3 million. ln addition to thirteen Military Liaison Teams, ARNG provided five personnel to serve as regional program managers at EUCOM  headquarters. The State Partnership  Program also hosted the National Interagency Counterdrug Institute Seminar on Military Support to Civil Authorities for twenty Central European and former Soviet Union partner nations.

A totalof2,100ARNG soldiers from military police units were deployed worldwide  in  FY 1997 for force  protection, installation security,  and  law enforcement activities, whi lc  nearly 4,500  conducted humanitarian  and civic assistance projects in various host nations, building or rehabilitating a total of21 schools, 7 clinics, 3 community centers, 4 wells, and 22 kilometers of farm-to-market roads. Another thousand ARNG soldiers deployed to U.S. Army, South, to provide organizational and direct support  maintenance at the  theater  and  equipment maintenance site.  During Operation PATRIOTS Mov~:, 6,589 soldiers moved the 35th Air Defense Artillery  Brigade from Fort Lewis to Fort Bliss, using ships, trains, and trucks.

## Reserve Component Support to Civil Authorities

Most  reserve  component  support  to  civil  authorities  relates  to  the counlcrdrug effort, which increased significantly during FY  1997 for both USAR and  ARNG.  USAR  units  and  personnel  constructed  roads  and fences along the Southwest border and provided linguists and intelligence analysts  to  U.S.  and  foreign  drug  law  enforcement agencies,  conducting 178  missions  with  l  ,785  soldiers.  ARNG  soldiers  assisted  in  marijuana detection and eradication, inspected container cargos at ports of  entry, and

conducted aerial  and  ground  reconnaissance.  In addition, they  provided transportation, engineer, linguist, intelligence, aviation, and drug demand reduction support. ARNG completed about 9,500 counterdrug operations during the year in all 54 states and territories, with 3,000 soldiers involved on a daily basis.

With  passage of the  Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  of 1996 (commonly  called  the  Nunn-Lugar-Domenici  legislation), USARacquired a new and significant mission. In addition to containing the majority of  the Army's chemical and medical units, USAR can contribute a multitude of  transportation, quartermaster, commu11ications, civil affairs,  and  engineer assets  in  response  to  a  terrorist  incident  involving weapons  of mass  destruction (WMD). To  improve  its  ability  to  provide military support to civilian authorities in such cases, USAR has appointed State  Emergency  Preparedness  Liaison  Officers,  Regional  Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers for Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) regions, and Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers to  serve with each U.S.  numbered army. USAR established a Weapons of Mass Destruction Domestic Preparedness Branch in Atlanta, Georgia, to oversee all  ofUSAR's  WMD initiatives.

USAR's primary  initiative  involves  the  use of its  DlVITs,  each  of which is aligned along FEMA boundaries and has a medical brigade and chemical battalion capable of  providing trained instructors. The Chemical and B iological Defense Command, responsible for overseeing the training initiative  under  the  Nunn-Logar-Domenici  legislation  to  train  the  first responders in WMD terrorist incidents, provides accreditation to instructors in  the DIVITs. A core group ofUSAR instructors is currently augmenting instructors  from the Chemical  and  Biological  Defense  Command  in providing  the  first  week  of training  to  first  responders.  Each  USAR WMD training team  includes soldiers with extensive nuclear,  biological, and  chemical  (NBC)  backgrounds  and  with  civilian  experience  in  law enforcement,  firefighting, hazardous  materials,  or  emergency  medical service. The teams are capable of  providing mobile team training, distance learning, or instruction through  local USARcenters.  Two USARefforts will decrease the current cost of  tra ining city officials and their first responders. Each DlVlT will  be restructured  to  include a WMD battalion capable of offering initial, sustainment, and  exercise training for first  responders.  In addition, five simulation brigades have been tasked to develop and execute simulation training for city officials and first responders.

Throughout FY  1997, ARNG units from forty-five  states performed 214 domestic support missions, which included law enforcement support, medical  evacuation,  search  and  rescue,  provision  of emergency  power and  communications, road and  debris clearance, security and  patrolling, :flooding relief support, provision of  emergency shelter and potable water,

and  general  avJatJOn support.  ARNG 's  most  significant  operations  in natural  disaster  relief during  the  year occurred  as  a  result of Hurricane Fran in North Carolina, Hurricane Hortense in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and flooding  in the  Midwest and the Ohio River Valley. ARNG members  also  participated  in  the  1997  Presidential  Inaugural,  serving as  security  and  ceremonial  personnel  and  providing  equipment.  In  the Benedum Airport Project, an  ARNG Innovative Readiness  Training Project in PY 1997, ARNG engineers assisted the West Virginia Airport  Authority. Engineer units  also  contributed  to  the  Navajo  Nation  Building  Project, reconstructing Blue Canyon Road between Sawmill and Fort Defiance in Arizona. During REEf'EX,  ARNG soldiers stripped decommissioned tactical vehicles and dropped them in preapproved locations off the coast of  New Jersey to establish  artificial reefs to prevent coastal erosion and to provide a home for marine life. ARNG members, beginning a five-year involvement, participated in the organization and planning of  a road construction project that will benefit the Netlakatla Indian community in Alaska.

## Equipment and Maintenance

Both USAR and ARNG made significant strides towards conserving resources. In keeping with  the Revolution in Business Affairs,  the  Guard Management  Control  Process  Administrators trained 1,01 7 program managers and administrators in FY  1997, a 54 percent increase over FY 1996.  At  the  beginning  of the  year,  ARNG  had  identified  21 areas  in which  improvements  needed  to  be  made  in  efficiency and  economy. By the end of  FY 1997, only 4 had been completed and 7 new areas identified, leaving  a  total  of 24  areas  requiring  improvement.  ln  one  program,  the Guard  Materiel Management Center  in  Lexington,  Kentucky,  conducted Internet searches of  surface and air Class IX parts that were available from Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices worldwide and redistributed them  to ARNG units, posting results on a web page. USAR reengineered its financial  management and business practices, resulting in a decrease of negative unliquidated obligations from $28 million in FY 1996 to $3 million in  FY  1997. ARNG further  improved  its  financial  situation  by  reducing its unliquidated obligations from $10.8 million to $5,000 during FY 1997. Only 8 percent of  all Army unmatched disbursements resulted from ARNG, which processed $6.2 billion in total net disbursements during the year.

Having  determined that the first-to-fight  units should  be the  first  to receive resources, the Army has begun to provide  a higher priority of  funding in both  the  active  and  reserve  components  for  combat service  support units required to deploy early. In the past, trucks, medical items, and other key  combat service  support  often  did  not  receive  procurement  funding because they did not have a high enough priority.  Even though the active

and reserve components were being integrated along force structure lines, DOD budgeting had  not been reformed to  reflect the changes. The Army consolidated all service requirements in  1996 into a single administrative process, which placed reserve requirements on an equal footing with active Army requirements.  Nevertheless,  shortfalls  in  essential equipment that existed in FY  1997 in the reserve components are  predicted to continue as  budgets decline.  USAR experienced an equipment-on-hand readiness rating of  C- 3 or higher in 85 percent of  its units.

The Army's current policy  on  equipping  its  force  relies  heavily  on redistribution of  equipment,  modifications,  smart  business  practices, and  procurement.  In  FY  1997,  the  reserve  components  received  the following equipment through redistribution or cascading: MlAl Abrams tanks,  Bradley  Infantry  Fighting Vehicles,  Mll3A3  Personnel  Carriers, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, CH-47D transport helicopters, UH- 60 helicopters,night  vision  devices,  field  kitchens,  transporter  bridges,  and tactical  wheeled  vehicles.  Much  of the equipment,  however,  is  old  and approaching  the  end  of its  life  cycle.  The  reserve  components  are  also scheduled  to receive  new  Patriot  missiles,  Avenger  missiles,  Global Positioning System equipment,  tactical  wheeled  vehicles,  the  Palletized Load System, heavy equipment transporters, NBC equipment, SINCGARS radios,  All-Source  Analysis  Systems,  M40  protective  masks,  Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units,  M916A2 Tractors,  120 mm.  mortars, and UH- 60 helicopters. Fielding of the  Paladin  field  artillery system to units  at echelons  above  division  will  begin  with  three  battalions  in  FY 1998.  Five  battalions  will  be fielded  in  FY  1999  and  one  in  FY 2000. Five additional battalions of Paladin will be fielded  to Ehanced Separate Brigades  in  FY 2000 and one in FY 2001.  In addition,  the  UC- 35  was fielded  to USAR in FY 1997the first jet aircraft to join the fixed-wing fleet.  By the  end of  FY  1998, USAR aviators will  be flying two UC- 35 j et aircraft. To  ensure  that its  soldiers can operate the  new  acquisitions, ARNG instituted an extensive New Equipment Training Program.

To  extend  the  service  life  of equipment and  improve  or modernize its  systems,  USAR  relies  on  depot  maintenance.  FY  1997  programs encompassed  converting I  ,800 generators to diesel; rebuilding  222 generators;  rebuilding  151  D7- F  bulldozers;  upgrading  and  rebuilding 89  rough  terrain  cargo  handlers;  converting  trailers;  refurbishing  and upgrading computers; modernizing trailers and tankers; remodeling 1,500 high-mobility,  multipurpose wheeled  vehicles;  remodeling 5-ton  trucks; and remodeling and upgrading watercraft and marine equipment. Most of these systems will  be rebuilt or remanufactured to original specifications or conditions under the Extended Service Program.

All  maintenance  on Army  equipment  conducted  above  the  direct support level is called sustainment maintenance. With implementation of

the Integrated Sustainment Maintenance program in May 1996, all Army organizations  and  activities  conducting  general  support  maintenance or  above  were  combined  into  the  National  Sustainment  Maintenance Management Office at Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. Integrated sustainment  maintenance  (ISM)  focuses  on  rebuilding  equipment  on production  lines  at central  locations  rather  than  repairing  components locally  or purchasing new  components. The national office coordinates regional sustainment maintenance, facilitates  the  transition  to  war,  and supports  contingency  operations. Regional  sustainment  maintenance management  offices  have  been  created  at  Fort Bragg,  North  Carolina, and  Fort  Hood, Texas,  and  in  USAREUR, with  others to  be  opened  in U.S. Army, Pacific, and Korea.

The major commands (MACOM), with an ISM control cell at the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Arlington, Virginia, provide oversight of  the  program  in  eight  local  sustainment  maintenance  management areas  (Texas,  Nebraska,  Utah,  Ohio,  Maine,  Pennsylvania,  Mississippi, and North Carolina). The MACOMs  established  local  sustainment maintenance management offices, with 22  fielded  by the end of FY  1997 and another 13 planned for FY  1998. Within each region, repair activities that  provide  quality  repairs  at  the  least  cost  have  been  identified  as centers of  excellence, which receive awards to repair specific components through  a  competitive  bid  process.  Of 11 7 such  activities,  19  belong  to FORSCOM,  18 to TRADOC, 77 to ARNG, and 3 to  USAR.  Planning for similar maintenance activities overseas will continue in  FY  1 998.

Through the Retrograde of  Equipment from  Europe program, excess Army equipment from  Europe  is redeployed, repaired, and  redistributed. ARNG operated five program repair sites in FY  1 997: Fort Riley, Kansas, for wheeled and  tracked vehicles; Camp Shelby, Mississippi, for wheeled and tracked vehicles; Piketon, Ohio, for engineer and  wheeled equipment; Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, for M3A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and wheeled vehicles; and Camp Withycomb, Oregon, for communications and  electronics  equipment. Seventy-five  percent  of the  3 15  persotmel working at the sites are ARNG personnel, while the rest are state or federal civilian employees.

In  an  effort  to  maintain  operational  readiness  of more  than  2,400 ARNG  aircraft,  500 aircraft  were  refurbished  during FY  1997,  and  220 of  the  oldest  aiJ· craft  were reti red. Improvements  to  ARNG  aviation maintenance  program  were  initiated  with  the  creation  of the  Aviation Classification  and  Repair Activity  Depot  21  project.  Regional  centers, rather than obtaining costly parts from the Army wholesale supply system, will conduct component part repairs on aircraft and return them to service with  a  lesser  expenditure  of funds. In  addition,  ARNG  reorganized  its support of expensive Stock  Funded Depot Level  Repairables for aviation

by  concentrating  them in  regions.  Under  another  initiative  the  Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) 2000 project studied what organization will  be  necessary  to  support new  aircraft being fielded  to ARNG units. After  determining  the  facilities,  support  equipment,  tools,  personnel structure, training, and mission that will be  necessary  to maintain readiness of  all ARNG aircraft, selected AASFs began testing the project's recommendations.  With  AASFs  linked  electronically  with  the  National Guard  Bureau,  ARNG  fielded  an  electronic  transmission  of real-time aircraft readiness data through the Aviation Logistics Module 1352 report, enabling more efficient use and management of  this critical resource.

In  September  1997  all  Army  components  participated  in  the  DOD Aviation Safety Stand Down, during which safety training was conducted and a commander's evaluation of unit safety was generated in  every unit. Despite dwindling resources in the flying hour program, ARNG continued to lead the rest of  DOD in aviation safety, with a Class A through C accident rate of only 2.76 percent.  In  addition, the number of Class A  through C ground accidents  decreased  by  5  percent during  the  fiscal  year.  Of the ground  accidents,  only  30  percent  involved  vehicles  (  19  percent Army and I 1 percent privately owned), while 65  percent were personal  injury accidents. With a disproportionate number offatal injuries occurring from vehicular  accidents,  however,  ARNG  launched  an  aggressive  national safety awareness campaign and unit training to reduce their occurrence.

In  one  initiative  to  enhance  aviation  readiness  and  safety  without incurring high costs,  ARNG developed an  Aviation  Reconfigurable Manned Simulator that can be programmed to resemble each helicopter in ARNG's inventory. The prototype was demonstrated in FY 1997 and will be used in the Division XXI  Aviation  Task Force during the  November 1997 advanced warfighting experiment. ARNG anticipates initiating a contract at the end ofFY 1998 for six collective training suites of  the simulator system.

Upgrading  software  and  hardware  requires  an  initial  investment  of funds that will eventually result in cost savings and efficiency. During FY 1997 ARNG purchased Windows NT, Microsoft Backoffice, and Microsoft Office 97 Professional as its standard network server and office automation software  and fielded the products to all fifty-four states and territories.  These programs enable ARNG systems to interact with the Reserve Component Automation  System and  the  Joint Technical Architecture. To  replace an OLltdated twelve-year-old automated system, ARNG purchased the Hewlett Packard  9000 K260 computer system. ARNG will  complete its  transfer of the  database  of records,  with maintenance required  by  congressional legislation,  to  the  new  system  by  the  middle of FY 1998.  At  that time, ARNG will begin to save $3.5 million in yearly maintenance costs. Newly responsible in FY  1997  for  the Army's Mobilization Movement Control (MOBCON) system, ARNG moved the Wang mainframe computer from

Fort  McPherson, Georgia, to  the 1\rmy National  Guard Readiness Center in  Arlington, Virginia, where it  is transferring MOBCON to Windows NT in  an operation that should be complete by February  1998.

One of the  methods  by  which  USAR has  reduced costs  is the  Shop Smart Program. Until recently, al I base operations support was required to be  provided  by  active Army  mi litary  installations,  requiring  USAR units to  travel  long distances  to  obtain  basic supplies and  services.  With  base closures and  the downsizing or the active force,  this  situation  worsened. In addition, all supplies purchased through the Defense Logistics Agency acquired a 23 percent surcharge. 1\ significant change permits USAR units to purchase items directly from local vendors, providing large savings when buying repair parts at fleet prices throughout the national commercial parts infrastructure,  in  addition  to  eliminating  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency surcharge.  Some  national  agreements  with  major manut~1cturcrs offer a "corporate purchase rate" to  USAR, decreasing its costs.

Both ARNG and  USAR operate and  must maintain a vast inventory of installations  and  facilities.  1\RNG  consists  of 3,735  units  in  2,700 communities  on  3,360  installations  in 54  states  and territories. In addition, ARNG supported the operation and maintenance of more than 18,000 training, aviation, and logistical facilities. USAR occupied  I  ,300 facilities,  consisting of 2,800  buildings and  structures with  an  average age of  33 years, and operated additional installations with another 2,600 buildings averaging 47 years old.  During FY 1997, $ 179.5 million  was awarded  from  various  years' appropriations  for  50  major  construction projects,  which  will  help  USAR  to  modernize,  maintain,  and  repair its  faci li ties  infrastructure.  The  FY  .1997  appropriation  of $78  million for major  construction  encompassed 16  projects  in Arkansas,  lowa, Kansas,  Louisiana, Massachusetts,  Missouri, Texas, and  Wisconsin.  Of the  appropriation,  $52  million  is  allotted  for  major  construction,  $20 million for planning and design, and $5.5 million  for unspecified  minor construction.  The  FY  1999  appropriation  of $71.3  million  for  USAR military  construction  will  fund  the  construction  of three  new  USAR centers in Michigan, Utah, and Virginia and an Aviation Support Facility in  Virginia;  revitalization  of facilities  in  Colorado,  Massachusetts,  and New York;  purchase of a leased  facility  in  Ohio; acquisition of land for a future  project; and  construction of an  airfield  crash  rescue station and improved machine gun range at  Fort  McCoy, Wisconsin.

Because  of a  congressional  increase  in  funds,  ARNG  was  able  to obligate  $203.5  million  for  real property  maintenance  (RPM)  in FY 1997, although this  was  $23  million  less  than  in  FY  1996.  RPM  funds were used to pay the costs for facility operations and projects; engineering services;  utilities;  and  minor construction,  maintenance,  repair  projects, and supplies necessary to extend the useful  life of  ARNG  facilities.  fn  FY

1988, ARNG's RPM fund  provided $3.41 per square foot to operate and maintain its facilities; this amount dwindled to $2.95 in FY 1997, or $2.30 in constant FY 1988 dollars.

USAR commands and controls six major installations, of which  two (Fort  McCoy  and  Fort  Dix)  are  power-projection  installations.  Relying on  USAR to  manage these power-projection  installations  relieves  active Army installations of simultaneously supporting the  mobilization of the USAR while deploying active Army units. FY 1999 RPM for USAR was funded  at only  38  percent of its $158.9 million  requirement,  creating a shortfall of  $58.1  million. This continued inadequacy in RPM funding has led  to deterioration ofUSAR facilities, forcing unit commanders to spend other mission dollars  on RPM.  Repairs to  critical  components, such  as structure, roofs, plumbing, and electrical and heating and air conditioning systems, have been continually deferred. Health, safety, property security, training, readiness, recruiting,  retention, and quality of life have all  been negatively affected.

ARNG 's  Environmental  Program  focuses on four major  areas: compliance,  restoration,  pollution  prevention,  and  conservation.  During FY 1997 ARNG  removed or upgraded 400 underground storage tanks  that  had not  met  Environmental  Protection  Agency  standards. In  addition,  it  reduced  the  number of violations at ARNG  facilities  25 percent by  upgrading vehicle wash-racks at 85  facilities,  conducting  14 air-quality  emissions  surveys,  constructing  58  hazardous  waste  storage buildings,  building 52 spill  contaimnent structures, installing 75  oil and water  separators,  and  completing  the  cleanup  of petroleum  spills  and contaminated indoor rifle ranges.  Jn  a new initiative, ARNG in FY  1997 created  at  each  state  headquarters  an  environmental  management  cell that  provided  environmental  awareness  training  and  rapid  response  to environmental  issues.  A  new  software  program,  Windows  Compliance Assessment and Sustainment Software, provided installation commanders with  a  tool  to  identify  compliance problems, develop a  correction  plan, estimate costs, analyze causes and trends, perform risk management, and track progress.

Pollution prevention and  restoration projects also received considerable attention.  ARNG  spent  $2  million  on  pollution  prevention  projects, exceeding DOD's  goal for reducing hazardous waste generation.

With  respect  to conservation in FY  1997,  ARNG  completed  2 environmental impact  statements; 21 environmental  assessments; 2 instruction manuals on managing training lands; 20 surveys on threatened and  endangered  species;  7  surveys  on  cultural  resources; 12  surveys on  biological  resources;  and  4  natural  resource  management  plans.  In addition, 26 natural resource management  plans were initiated. Through the Environmental Program, ARNG aggressively implemented the Integrated

Training  Area  Management  Program  at  forty-three  separate  locations, with  the  goal  of including  all  primary  training  sites  by  FY  1999.  The Geographical  Information  Services  (GIS)  system,  an  analytical  support package that assists in developing realistic training to meet environmental requirements, was in place in thirty-one states, with ten having been added in  FY  1997. ARNG was selected to  operate one of the Army's four GIS regional  support centers in FY J  998. Throughout FY  1997, ARNG spent $26.5 million conducting 22 preliminary assessments of  sites for possible contamination, 13 site inspections, J 0 remedial investigations to determine the  extent  of contamination,  and  16  remediation  projects  to  eliminate contamination.  These  activities, part of  the Installation Restoration Program, were also initiated at an additional  136 sites in FY  1997.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

In  keeping with Army Vision 2010, the Army continued its Revolution in  Military Logistics during FY  1997. To support a  highly  mobile force, Army logistics is being transformed from a system of  large stockpiles, little visibility of  goods while in  transit, and slow or unresponsive distribution to a system with small stockpiles, high visibility of  goods in transit, and an  improved  distribution  system.  The  Revolution  in  Military  Logistics encompasses  radical  changes  in three  areas: force projection,  force sustainment,  and  technology  application.  Increased  strategic  mobility, enhanced support to individual soldiers, and improved business practices arc essential for Army logisticians to be able to support missions across the full spectrum of  military operations. With industry as its partner, the Army has  focused  on attaining information supremacy, integrating systems, and redesigning its organizations to create a single, seamless logistics system. Logistics  initiatives  that will provide  real-time,  global  visibility  and management of  logistics resources and capabilities include joint total asset visibility, in-transit visibility, battlefield distribution, velocity management, and the integrated combat service support system.

Partnerships between the government, industry, and academic institutions  will  decrease  the high  costs and  lengthy procurement cycles for  many  military  items  through contract reform,  innovative  production practices, and new research. As the Army's  reliance on the defense industry grows, logistics planning and execution will  require the full  participation of the industry.  At the end  of FY  1997,  the  commercial  sector operated ten  Army  logistics  facilities,  maintained  two  inactive Army  plants,  and leased sections of  the Anniston Army Depot, Alabama. All of  these actions reduced the Army's overhead costs.

During FY 1997 the service announced the Army Wholesale Logistics Modernization Program, which envisions outsourcing the existing dated system to a private sector contractor that will gradually introduce modern information technology. Anticipated benefits  include reducing  wholesale logistics  inventories by  billions of  dollars,  increasing supply availability,

cutting logistics system response time significantly, and improving readiness. The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command has the lead on  the program.

To ensure that  logistics  initiatives  are  in  line with Army  Vision  2010 and  to  guide  the  logistics  process,  the  Army  Strategic  Logistics  Plan was  created.  Priorities  for  Army  resources and  requirements  have  been set  in  the  plan,  which  provides  objectives  for  the  near  term,  midterm, and  long  term.  To  incorporate  the  Revolution  in  Military  Logistics,  the Army Strategic Logistics Plan was rewritten during FY  1997 and will  be completely revised by the end  of  October 1997. The plan provides senior logisticians a framework for establishing the logistics infrastructure needed to accomplish the Revolution in Military Logistics as the Army proceeds from Force XXI initiatives to the Army After Next (AAN).

With the installation XXI concept, the  Army intends to develop effective and economical  installation  services  at igned to support  and maintain military forces at an appropriate readiness level.  Installation XXI  will be achieved through the successful implementation of Installation  Vision  20  0, I which establishes  policy  and  doctrinal  guidance  for  planning,  programming, and  operating Army  installations. Through Installation  Vision  2010, the Army plans to correct deficiencies in  installations and  their services that have occurred as a result of inadequate funding. Army  installations today experience high levels of  mobilization, training, deployment, sustainment, and redeployment of troops, creating a more insistent demand that aging and deteriorating infrastructures be significantly improved.

Because most continental  United States  (CONUS)  installations have been designated as power-projection or supporting platforms, installation management  is  one  element  in  the  Army  Strategic  Mobility  Program (ASMP). The ASMP's Strategic Mobility Infrastructure Program provides funds  to  improve  the  infrastructure at power-projection  installations. To ensure  that  military  forces  and  their equipment  can  be  deployed  within established  guidelines,  rail  systems,  airfields,  ports,  storage  facilities, depots,  and  warehouses  must  be  modernized,  expanded,  and  improved. In  addition,  the ASMP  calls  for  an  expansion  in  Army  equipment  pre› positioned afloat on ships, an increase in rail cars and containers, automation of the  deployment  process,  modernization  of watercraft,  and  improved deployment training. Under the Strategic Mobility Infrastructure Program, projects costing $56  million  in  Military  Construction, Army,  funds were initiated at Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and the Port of  Concord, California, in  FY  1997.

Additionally,  of five  construction projects  awarded in FY  1997, the  Army  was  upgrading  and  extending  the  Charleston Naval  Weapons Station  Pre-position  Facility  and  Wharf:  South  Carolina,  to  support  its pre-positioned  equipment  afloat;  and  upgrading ammunition facilities  at

West Coast ports. The U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers (USACE), using $2 million from Operations and Maintenance, AJ·my (OMA), funds, improved facilities  at  the  Hawthorne Army  Depot,  Nevada;  the  Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky; Fort Eustis, Virginia; and the Crane Army Ammunition Activity, Indiana.

The installation status report (TSR) provides an installation commander with a more  accurate  depiction  of  the condition  and maintenance requirements  of  facilities.  Before  the  lSR,  a  commander relied  on  the vastly understated backlog of  maintenance and repair as the measure of  an installation's condition and justification for future funding. Nevertheless, installations did  not receive  sufficient funds  to  fill  even  their minimally stated requirements, resulting in severe deterioration over the years. Using the  ISR  in  1996,  the Army  began  estimating  the  total  funds  needed  to eliminate  long-standing deficiencies and to  upgrade facilities to  modern standards. Using cost algorithms to determine how much money would be needed to bring Army facilities to acceptable levels, the ISR demonstrated that previous requirements had been severely underestimated. In FY 1997 ISR data analysis indicated that the cost to bring all Army facilities, except for family housing, to a C1  condition would be $25.7 billion. In contrast, the last reported estimate under the previous system was only $3 billion.

The creation of  the assistant chief  of  staff  for installation management (ACSIM)  in 1993 provided  a  single proponent  for  base  operations (BASOPS)  of 269  Army  installations  throughout  the  world.  ACSIM conducts oversight of $100 billion of real property and  12 million acres of land. The cost of BASOPS, $10 billion annually,  is  16 percent of the Army' s total budget and one-third of  its discretionary funds. Most  BASOPS activities  occur  in  the  civilian  worldbuilding  and  road  maintenance, obtaining and distributing supplies and material, and managing equipment maintenanceand the Army has determined which should remain under Army operation and which should be contracted to civilian firms. Despite its  importance,  however,  only  81  percent  of all  BASOPS  requirements were funded in FY 1997, further contributing to the difficulty in improving installation infrastructure.

An  important element of power projection  is the ability to transport goods.  During  DESERT  STORM,  commercial  rail  cars  for  moving  Army equipment and ammunition to ports of embarkation  were  inadequate  in number and response time. The Defense Freight Railway T terchange Fleet n (DFRlF), which provides flatcars to  transport heavy DOD equipment and tankers to move bulk petroleum, oil, and lubricant products, pre-positioned part of its  fleet  at the  Forces  Command  (FORSCOM),  the Training  and Doctrine Command, and the Industrial Operations Command ammunition depots  and  plants  to  solve  the  problem.  In  1993  the  AJmy  established the ASMP Rail  Program, in which the acquisition of 1,090 rail cars was

directed to supplement the DFRTF pre-positioned cars.  By the end of FY 1997, the Army had purchased and modified 590 used rai I cars for use at Force Support Package  I ammunition depots and plants. The ASMP Rail Program  also  funded  railroad track  maintenance,  new  tracks,  hardstand construction, and the purchase of  container-handling equipment.

Total  asset  visibility  is  one  logistics  initiative  that  provides  better stewardship of  Army assets and improved command and control. It enables the Army to continually track the !low of equipment and  supplies so that the  right  item  arrives  at  the  right  location  at  the right  time. Total asset visibility is currently being used in Bosnia and Europe, providing real-time information  on  equipment inventory  in depots,  contractor  facilities,  and units, as well as in transit between locations. Using total asset visibility, the Army is able to redistribute assets instantaneously, divert assets that are in transit, and avoid  buying and repairing unnecessary  items.

In  another initiative, the Army ceased funding the Department of the Army  Movements Management System- Redesign (DAMMS-R)  in June 1997 other  than to resolve year  2000 problems.  Transportation Coordinator' s Automated  Information  for  Movements  System  II  (TCAIMSII),  which will  transmit intertransit visibility to  the Global Transportation  Network, was designated as the successor to DAMMS- R. The Movement Tracking System  (MTS), which  currently transmits  transportation  movement data of  Army cargo directly to the Global  Transportation Network, is scheduled to interface with  TCAIMSTI  in FY 2000.  The MTS consists of  commercial satellite tracking technology acquired under an Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Logistics  (DODCSLOG)  initiative and  installed  in  selected United States Army, Europe (USAREUR), transportation units.

Under velocity management, the Army strives to guarantee timclines for delivery of  supplies  and equipment  to units, thereby reducing administrative  requirements,  decreasing  stockage  costs,  and  improving delivery times. Success is measured by the order-ship time, or the number of  days from  when a customer submits a requisition until the item arrives at  the  appropriate supply  support  activity. The  Army  did  not,  however, meet  any  of its  velocity  management  goals  in  FY  1997.  Although  the goal was  to  achieve  an  order-ship  time  of 5  to  8 days  for  items within CONUS, the actual order-ship  times  ranged  from 14.4 to  27.5  days. For sup  pi ics  and  equipment  transported overseas  by  air,  tho order-ship  time goal of I  5 days  was exceeded, with  actual  order-ship times from  17.9 to 23  days.  Nevertheless,  order-ship  times  have  gradually  improved  each year, with the greatest reduction occurring among items shipped overseas. A Velocity  Management  Group,  made  up  of senior Army  logisticians, worked extensively with Army installations and Defense Logistics Agency to synchronize cycle times, provide dedicated transportation support, and eliminate wasted time.

In another effort at streamlining logistics operations, the Task Force on Equipment Reduction and Redistribution created the Automatic Disposal List, which was in its third year of  publication in FY 1997.  The list identifies equipment that can be turned in for easy and quick disposal by modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) and table of  distribution of allowances (TDA) units without gaining prior approval from the National Inventory  Control Point,  as  was  previously  required.  Equipment  on  the Automatic Disposal List may be relinquished in an "as is" condition as long as its disposal will not create a shortage in  the unit. Units must dispose of their equipment through their supply support activity and, if an MTOE or TDA equipment shortage  will  be  created, must obtain permission from the nearest colonel in their chain of command. The Automatic Disposal List includes  weapons  systems,  systems  requiring  demilitarization,  and systems in precious metal recovery programs.

The Logistics Civil Augmentation  Program (LOGCAP) was devised to augment organic and traditional logistical support provided to warfighting commander  in  chiefs  (CINC),  foreign  governments,  and  international organizations through long-term contractual support that could be activated in  peacetime,  contingency  situations,  or  war.  Readily  available  civilian contractors  would  provide  needed  combat  support  and  combat  service support, offer a rapid contracting capability, and assist in constructing and operating  bases and  logistics camps for deployed  troops  during  the  first l80 days of  a contingency. Other support would include weapons systems maintenance,  materiel management,  transportation, and  port operations. In  the  contingency  planning  documents,  the  contractor  would  specify requirements, resources, costs, timelines, and quality-control measures.

The first comprehensive LOGCAP support contract, administered by USACE, was awarded  to  Brown &amp; Root Services  Corporation  in  1992 and ended on  2 August  1997.  Brown &amp; Root supported six contingency operations  (Somalia,  Rwanda,  Saudi  Arabia/Kuwait,  Haiti,  Italy,  and Bosnia) at  a cost  of$823.6 million. Its support  to Operation JOINT GuARD was extended under the sole-source Balkans Sustainment Contract managed by USAREUR and US  ACE. On 1 October 1996, theAnny Materiel Command (AMC) became responsible for administering the next LOGCAP contract, which  was awarded to DynCorp (Aerospace), Inc., on 30 January 1997. This AMC support contract focuses  on peacetime contingency planning that  will provide  logistical,  engineering,  and  construction  support  as needed by CINCs. The doctrine for LOGCAP planning, acquisition, and utilization has been incorporated into Army publications and programs of instruction. During FY 1997  the  LOGCAP regulation, Army Regulation 700- 137, was under revision.

To  maintain a  daily  capability to  respond  to  crises as  part of crisis response  cells  or  crisis  action  teams,  ODCSLOG  operates  a  Logistics

Operations  Center  within  the  Army  Operations  Center.  The  Logistics Operations Center was staflcd with  lour personnel in  FY  1997: the officer in  charge (a  colonel),  two  briefing officers (lieutenant colonel or major), and  an  administrative  officer (General  Schedule [GS)- 1 2).  During crises the  cell  was  augmented  with  other  personnel  from  ODCSLOG,  AMC, the Office of the  Surgeon  General,  and  the  Military Traffic Management Command. In addition to providing logistics support  to the Army Operations Center,  the  Logistics  Operations  Center tracks  projects, operations,  and tasks for the deputy chief of  staff for logistics.

In  response to  changes  in  the  post- Cold War NATO (North Atlantic Treaty  Organization)  environment,  the  NATO  Land Forces  Logistics Working Group established NATO's operational  logistics support doctrine in  the  draft Allied  Joint  Logistics  Publication-4, Allied Joint  Logistics Doctrine. The working group also decided that Standardization Agreement 2406,  Allied  Logistics  Publication- 9, Land Forces  Logistics  Doctrine, required  revis. ion to reflect  the  doctrine  in  the  new  draft  publication. Originally ratified in  1993, the revision of Land rorces Logistics Doctrine in FY 1997  changes  logistics  support  in multinational operations  to a  collective  rather  than  a  national responsibility.  The  revision  will  be presented to the working group in April  1 998 and, after a national review by working group members, will be ratified and implemented.

## Maintenance

During 1997 only five maintenance depots and eight ammunition plants remained  in  the Army depot system.  Developing and  producing advanced weapons  systems  and  military  equipment  had l argely  devolved to the commercial defense industry.  Except for depot facilities al Watervliet, New York, and Rock Island, lllinois, the Army depot  system had been transformed into  providing  only  rebuild  and  maintenance  of major-end  items.  Depot maintenance has become the Army's  strategic maintenance sustainment base, capable of  filling equipment shortages, modernizing the force, and ensuring equipment  readiness  for  25 percent  of  new  equipment  procurements. Nevertheless, the depot requirement in FY 1997 for $93 1  million was funded at 77 percent, leaving $2 14 mi Ilion of  maintenance requirements unfunded. Although the defense industry has become interested in  conducting rebuild and overhaul  work,  legislation  limits the percentage of depot maintenance conducted in the private sector to 40 percent. Congress in  1996 defeated the Department of  Defense (DOD) proposal to lift this restriction, but at the end of  FY  1997 was considering DOD's request to amend the legislation to allow the defense industly to perform 50 percent of  depot maintenance.

The  Army  is  currently  in  the  process  of consolidating  core  depot maintenance capabilities at organic depots  to  improve  efficiency and  to

complete the non-core  depot maintenance workload.  The  Base  Realignment and  Closure Commission (BRAC) in  1995 recommended, and Congress approved,  switching  the tactical  missile  guidance system  mission from Letterkenny  Army Depot to  Tobyhanna Army Depot, both in Pennsylvania, or  to  the  private  sector.  Moreover,  BRAC  stated  that  all  maintenance missions not pertaining to the Bradley Fighting Vehicle should be moved from Red River Army Depot, Texas, to other depot maintenance facilities, or the private sector. As statutory restrictions hampered implementation in 1996, the Army decided against privatizing the tactical missile guidance system  mission.  Red  River would  retain  the  Bradley  and  the  Multiple Launch Rocket System, while theM  l  3 Armored Personnel Carrier and J the M9 Armored Combat Engineer Vehicle would be moved to Anniston Army Depot and the AH- 64 Apache Armament Subsystem to the Corpus Christi Army  Depot, Texas,  by  FY  1999.  During FY  1997,  the  Army worked  to  move  the  towed/self-propelled combat vehicle  mission  from Letterkenny Army Depot to Anniston Army Depot by FY 2000.

The  readiness  status  of sixteen  major  weapons  systems  provides a  baseline  for  the  Army  to  assess  its  ability  to  sustain  intense  combat operations for  a  lengthy  period.  The  percentage  of time  in  which  each weapons system is fully mission capable is an  indicator of readiness and readiness trends. For ai rcraft, the goal  is 75 percent fully mission capable, except for  the  UH- 60,  for  which  the  goal  is  80  percent.  For all  other equipment, the goal is 90 percent. During FY 1997 all systems exceeded their  goals,  resulting  in  a  vast  improvement from  FY  1996,  when  five systems did not meet their goals. Moreover, the fully mission-capable rate of every system either improved or remained the same; none decreased. Far more significant, however, was the tremendous increase in  readiness of several systems. The MlA2 Abrams tank increased  its fully  mission› capable rate from 71  percent to 95 percent; the U  H- 60 helicopter from 69 to  81  percent, the AH- 64 helicopter from 64 to  85  percent, the OH- 58D from 75 to 87 percent, and the CH-47D helicopter from 70 to 77 percent. The fully  mission-capable rate for each of the sixteen systems is shown in Table 29.

Another key indicator of  unit readiness is the unit equipment on hand. The Army's goal  is  to  attain  an  S- 3  rating  for  its  equipment  on  hand, but, at  the  beginning of FY  1997,  537  units had a  rating below S- 3.  By identifying excess equipment in one unit,  the Army can redistribute  the equipment to  meet a shortfall in another unit,  allowing an improvement in  overall readiness at minimal cost. The Army established goals  for  FY 1997 of  bringing 56 units to  the S- 3  readiness level and redistributing $1 billion worth of  equipment. Throughout the fiscal year, however, the Army redistributed $2 billion of  equipment to  the reserve components, resulting in 314 units reaching or exceeding the S- 3 readiness level.

## Sustainment

Following Operation DG S ERT STORM, the 1992 DOD  Mobility Requirements Study established a framework for force projection operations, and  DOD dedicated funds  to  improve the sealift, airlift, pre› positioned  equipment,  and  installation  infrastructure.  Under the  ASMP, the Army must be able to deploy 1 light brigade within 4 days; 3 divisions (I  light, I air assault, or 1 airborne division delivered by air and 2 armored divisions delivered by sea) within 30 days; and 2 more divisions plus corps and  theater  support  elements  within  75  days.  In  the  1995  Bottom-Up Review Update, Army pre-positioned equipment was deemed a necessity to meet early warfighting requirements, provide a U.S. presence overseas, and facilitate force projection. The Global Pre-positioning Strategy meets these  timelines  by  stationing  seven  sets  of unit  equipment  for  heavy brigades  in  the  U.S. Central  Command,  U.S. Pacific  Command,  and

U.S.  European Command areas  of responsibility. The Army  is  currently completing its  redistribution of existing pre-positioned equipment from Europe  to  Qatar  and  Korea,  as  well  as  continuing  to  support  forces deployed to  Bosnia with  pre-positioned equipment. All of these sets are stored  in  climate-controlled  warehouses,  with  some  equipment  being modernized and  digitized  to  meet Force XXI timelines. The Army War Reserve  Support  Command,  a  subordinate  element  of AMC,  manages the Army  Pre-positioned  Stocks  (APS)  program.  In  recent reviews,  the General Accounting Office (GAO) has criticized the Army for maintaining excess equipment in the pre-positioned sets and for its level of  equipment readiness. The GAO  is  currently  conducting another study  on all  DOD pre-positioned equipment. Table 30 shows the equipment and locations for each numerically designated APS.

Operational  projects  are  tailored  sets  of equipment  and  supplies configured for  specific  operations, such as  field  hospitals,  port opening operations,  airdrop resupply, base  camps, mortuary  affairs, pipeline operations,  bridging,  and  hot  and  cold  weather  clothing.  War  reserve sustainment  stocks  enable  initial  and  reinforcing  units  to  operate  in  a theater for  30  to  45  days.  Because  of unfunded  requirements,  however, APS- 5 sites have critical shortfalls of repair parts necessary to maintain operations  in  the fi rst few  days  of  a  contingency. To  expedite time upon arrival at anAPS site, units are issued automated battlebooks on CD- ROM

that describe the assets on hand,  provide a schematic of the ship or land storage facility, and explain procedures for drawing equipment.

The APS- 3 equipment is  being transferred to the new large medium› speed roll-on/roll-off ships,  which,  in addition  to  humidity  control,  have greater capacity and higher speed than the ships currently being used. This will  result  in  fewer  ships,  decreased  force  closure  times,  and  enhanced equipment readiness. As of  the end ofFY 1997, the Army had completed a maintenance cycle of  APS- 3 equipment on  a container  ship, an ammunition ship, and a heavy lift pre-position ship.

In April  1996, while developing its acqtdsition strategy for container ships,  the  Military  Sealift  Command  requested  that the  Army quantify its  requirements  for  containers  of munitions  pre-positioned  afloat.  The Army currently uses three lighter aboard ships (LASH), stationed at Diego Garcia  in  the Indian  Ocean, to pre-position combat loads of sustainment ammunition afloat for  three corps. The  ammunition  is  stored  on  pallets and placed on seventy barges (each measuring 60  x 26  x  I  0 )  on each LASH. Unloading is accomplished by splashing the barges overboard into the  sea, pushing the  barges to  shore with shipboard tugs,  and separating the pallets. Container ships offer a faster sailing time (24 knots compared with  16 for the LASI-I), faster off-loading time (24 hours compared with 2 weeks for the LASH), direct delivery to the user with minimum handling and  pilferage, better  protection  from  the  weather,  partial  or  selective unloading of munitions,  and  a  quick  resupply  capability. Two  container ships can hold the Army's  pre-positioned ammunition, saving $10 million per year  in  leasing  costs.  In addition,  replacing  palletized  ammunition with  containerized ammunition will save $6 million  per year.  The Army approved  the plan  in FY  1997  to  pre-position ammunition  on container ships and will execute the transfer from the LASH vessels in FY 1999.

Funded  under  ASMP  as  the  Force  Projection  Container  Initiative and  designed  to  revolutionize  how  the  Army  will  load,  transport,  and distribute  munitions and supplies,  the  third  generation  of the  Palletized Load System flatrack (removable cargo bed) is being developed. In March 1996  the  Army  began  evaluating prototypes  of the  container  roll-in/out platform (CROP) that can be inserted and transported inside a commercial container. By June the Army decided to  use all FY 1997 flatrack funding ($65.5 million) to purchase CROP ftatracks. The CROP iiatrack consists of a  16.5-ton capacity  wheeled  vehicle  prime  mover with self-load and -unload  capability,  a 16.5-ton  capacity  trailer,  and  a  flatrack.  Within minutes,  the  flatrack  can  be picked  up  and  loaded  or  unloaded  from  a container, allowing for rapid movement, relocation, and storage. Contracts were awarded in July  1997 for a  total  of 15,788 CROP flatracks for pre› positioning at ammunition  depots  and  plants,  for  use  with  APS- 3,  and for training purposes. In  September  1997  the Army began  to  develop  a

CROP model for loading Multiple-Launch Rocket System (MLRS) rocket pods  and  155-mm.  projectiles,  which  will  reduce  unloading times  to  5 minutes for any type of  load, saving 40 to 55  minutes. After validation and testing, the Army will  begin to use CROP flatracks  in  unloading APS- 3 munitions stocks when container ships replace LASH ships in  FY 1999. A loaded CROP flatrack  inside a container will  provide additional security and safety over previous flatrack designs.

Cognizant that  it  must  improve  quality of life  for  its soldiers  as  an important element of sustainment, the Army during FY 1997 awarded  19 projects to improve family housing and made additional awards to renovate or construct 10,607 barracks spaces. Of  the 3,400 units of  family  housing programmed  for  revitalization  or  replacement,  the  Army  revitalized  or replaced  1,746  units  but is  still  not on  track  to  meet  its  35-year-cycle requirements. Funding shortages continued to impair the Army's  ability to meet its quality-of-life objectives.

The Army did  obtain  increased  funding  to  construct,  upgrade,  and modernize barracks  in  the Whole Barracks Renewal  Program to provide accommodations for single soldiers comparable to those  for married soldiers and to what was ava. ilable  in  the  civilian  community.  By 2012 the Army plans to provide barracks that provide one room per soldier, a  bathroom shared by two soldiers, walk-in closets, new furnishings, additional parking, landscaping, and the separation of  living space from administrative offices. In  the  Barracks Upgrade Program,  the  same amenities will  be  produced, although the living spaces will be slightly smaller. As ofFY 1997, a total of 23  projects have been awarded to contractors; $149 million  was obligated for barracks upgrade during the year. All  barracks will be upgraded by 2008 in CONUS, 2010 in Europe, and 20 12 in Korea.

Major  improvements  are  also  continuing  in the  Soldier  System, the family  of integrated  systems  for  the  individual  soldier consisting of everything that is worn, carried, or consumed  in a  tactical environment. Developments  in  individual  equipment;  weapons;  clothing;  subsistence items; and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence  system  are enhancing  a  soldier's  survivability, lethality, sustainment,  and  ability  to  communicate.  The  Army  has  developed  a cohesive plan for coordinating the development of  Soldier System items in the near term, midterm, and long term. Through the Soldier Enhancement Program (SEP), which capitalizes on items available commercially, such as  small arms,  night vision  devices,  individual  soldier radios,  clothing, and  individual  equipment,  solutions  can  be fielded  eighteen  to  twenty› four months after a concept materializes. Enhancements to  clothing and individual equipment (CIE) often require research, development, test, and evaluation  (ROTE) that lasts  more than  thirty-six  months.  About twenty new SEP/CIE items are under development each  year,  and  in  FY  1997

these  included  lightweight equipment, ballistic and  laser eye  protection, modular body  armor,  a  modular load  system,  improved protection with reduced weight, and improved chemical protective clothing.

About  100  to  125  projects  for  the  Soldier  System  are  in  various stages  of RDTE each year,  requiring  significant  investments  in science and technology.  Many of these projects fall under the Warrior programs: Land Warrior, Mounted Warrior, and Air Warrior. Land Warrior is the first generation  integrated  fighting  system  for  dismounted  combat  soldiers, improving survivability and capabilities for night operations. Each soldier will  have an integrated computer/radio; enhanced protective clothing and individual  equipment;  integrated  headgear with helmet-mounted display and image intensifier; and a modular weapon system with a thermal weapon sight, infrared laser aiming light, laser rangefinder, digital compass, video camera,  and  close-combat optic. The Land Warrior system  will  include an  embedded Global  Positioning  System (GPS)  and  an  advanced  load› carrying capability. With the ability to conummicate on the battlefield and to  report information  in  real time through digital  and video media, each soldier will contribute to and possess enhanced situational awareness. With an early operational experiment completed in early FY  1997, · fielding of Land Warrior is planned for FY  2000. Mounted Warrior is a developmental program that will increase the capability of a crew and fighting platform to  identify, locate, and destroy targets under all environmental conditions; improve survivability; and permit operations to be tailored to meet specific missions. Maximizing developments made in other programs, particularly Land Warrior, Air Warrior will develop new  and  improved  aviation  life support equipment for  rotary-wing aviators. A contract was awarded  for Air Warrior in May 1997.

In another initiative  that will improve sustainment and quality of life for  soldiers,  the Army  has  developed the Army Field  Feeding System› Future. At the company level (enhanced), the new system adds an M- 59 range to the kitchen for cooking in forward areas. TheM- 59 does not use gasoline and, therefore,  improves safety. With  this new system, the Army has given its forward units the capability to prepare and distribute a cooked meal every day rather than ~very third day. ·

## Security Assistance

United States  national security and  military strategies are supported through the security assistance program, which promotes the development or  maintenance  of a  military  capability  sufficient  for  other  nations  to defend  themselves  from  aggressors,  thereby  decreasing  the  likelihood of U.S.  military  involvement on their  behalf.  In  addition  to  improving regional and world stability, the security assistance program improves the

U.S.  economy by supporting the defense industrial base. The U.S. Army Security  Assistance Command conducts security assistance through foreign military sales in other countries and with international organizations.

Throughout the fiscal year, progress occurred on a variety of  foreign military  sales  programs.  The  Army  delivered  AN/TPQ- 37  Firefinder artillery  locating  radars  to  Korea  and  began  preparing the first  6  of 29 MLRS launchers for delivery in August 1998. Coproduction of  555 M tAl tanks  continued in  Egypt and should  be  completed  in  1998. The Army fielded 315  Ml  A2 Abrams tanks to  Saudi Arabia and 245  to  Kuwait.  In addition, 8 Patriot firing units were delivered to Saudi Arabi.a in FY 1997, with another 14 to be delivered in FY 1998. Delivery of  Patriot firing units to Kuwait,  which  began in  FY 1996, continued  throughout the year and will end in FY 1998.

At the end of  FY  1997, the most significant Army security assistance programs that were awaiting approval  by the State Department included CH-47D helicopters to Greece ($376 million) and Egypt ($149 million); MLRS rocket pods to Israel  ($30 million); AN/TPQ- 36(V)9 Firefinder mortar  locating  radars to  Turkey ($26 million); and  the potential coproduction in  Egypt of the M88A2 Recovery Vehicle ($250 million). Additionally,  Congress  was  reviewing  a  number  of programs  at  the end  of the  fiscal  year:  OH- 58D  helicopters  to Taiwan  ($172  million); AH- 64D  helicopters  to  Kuwait ($800  million);  and Stinger missiles  to Korea  ($45  million).  Other  programs  under  consideration  by  foreign countries included Patriot infrastructm· e  to  Japan ($7  million);  Bradley system support to Saudi Arabia ($532 million); Hawk missile training and materiel to Greece ($131.7 million); Dual Mounted Stinger to Taiwan ($21 million); Stinger training and  support to Korea  ($186  million); M60A3 tanks to Thailand ($100 million); and 90-mm. turret weapons system to Saudi Arabia ($1.1  million).

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961  provides the President with the ability  to  support  foreign  policy  programs  without  seeking  additional legislative  authority  or  budgetary  appropriations.  Through a  drawdown authority,  the  president can  direct  that U.S.  government equipment and services be transferred to other nations to assist in emergencies, military contingencies,  peacekeeping,  counterdrug  missions,  and  humanitarian operations. Although there is  a limit on the dollar amount of equipment and services that may be transferred in a given fiscal year, Congress does not reimburse the military services for the equipment they are directed to transfer.  In  the Army,  funds  for  execution  of the  presidential drawdown authority are  taken  from  the  OMA account; in FY 1997 the Army spent $34.9 million for drawdown activities. The largest transfers were made to Jordan ($9.5 million), Bosnia ($10.1 million), and Mexico ($8.7 million). Equipment and services provided  to  Jordan  and Bosnia  were  part of a

long-term expansion of  military capabilities in those countries, while those delivered  to  Mexico  were  in  support of counterdrug efforts. Drawdown programs have negatively affected the Army's  OMA funds and remained a serious concern throughout FY 1997.

Developing nations are not the only ones to receive security assistance from  the  United  States.  The  Army  participates  in  material-technical cooperation  with  industrialized  nations  to  improve  the  compatibility  of their military forces and to foster cooperation with respect to armaments. The Office of the  Deputy Undersecretary  of the Army for International Affairs (ODUSA [IA]) works with other nations to eliminate duplication, share risk, and reduce costs of  developing weapons systems by cooperating and sharing technology. At the end ofFY 1997, the Army had 100 bilateral and multilateral international cooperative  research  and  development agreements and 280 data and professional exchange agreements in place with thirty-one countries.

ODUSA  (IA)  also  serves  as  the  point  of  contact  for  the  Army with  members  of the  Washington  Foreign  Military Attache  Corps  and accredited  168  foreign  military  attaches  from  86  countries  during  FY 1997.  In addition  to  providing  diverse  support services  to  the  attaches, ODUSA (lA) hosted visits from high-ranking foreign military and civilian personnel  throughout  the  year.  The  organization  represents  the  Army on  international  affairs  issues  involving other government agencies  and multinational organizations. During FY  1997 ODUSA (JA) was involved in, among others, the following programs:  Treaty Implementation Planning (Panama), International Commemorations, Vietnamese Commando Compensation, Harvard University Executive Seminar for General Officers from  Russia  and  the  Ukraine,  Global  Humanitarian Demining,  and  the 1999 Washington NATO Summit.

## Research, Development, and  Acquisition

In the near term, from FY 1998 to FY  2003, the Army will concentrate its  efforts  on ensuring that combat capabilities exceed those  of potential enemies; funding research and developmentto  support  theAAN; retiring old systems that are expensive to maintain and inserting technology into others to extend their useful lives; and achieving information dominance by 2010. During the  midterm period,  from  FY 2004 through FY  2010,  the Army will  continue to emphasize information dominance, insert technology, and replace old equipment. The Army expects in the long term, from FY 2011 to  FY  2020,  to  ilwest  in science and  technology  to  maintain  battlefield dominance. Despite the fact that increased funding for modernization will be needed to achieve full-spectrum dominance, the Army was not forced to cancel any major weapons systems in  FY 1997. To support higher priority

modernization efforts, the Army has lengthened the development period or I  im  itcd  the  procurement of  other weapons systems.

Each  of the  eleven  programs  approved  for  the  Warfighting  Rapid Acquisition Program (WRAP) in FY 1997 supports the Army's  digitization and modernization plans, providing new technology to soldiers as quickly as possible. Funds of  $5.6 mi Ilion are being used in FY 1997 to develop a laser range designator for the Striker Mobile Scout, a scout vehicle based on  the  high-mobility  multipurpose  wheeled  vehicle  (HMMWV),  with automated  targeting  and  day/night  observation  capabilities.  Twenty-five prototypes of  the digitized Mortar Fire Control System, which will  permit integration with other artillery fire control data systems on the battlefield, were being developed with $5 million in FY  1997 funds. A total oftwenty prototypes  of the  Gun  Laying  Positioning  System,  which  will  decrease the  time for positioning field  arti  II cry  guns,  were  under development for $3.5  million  in  FY  1997  monies.  Another  $5  million  of WRAP  funds arc  purchasing  fifteen  prototypes  of the  Lightweight  Laser  Designator Rangclinder, a portable, day/night, all-weather laser designator and  target locator. A virtual battlefield measuring 300 kilometers in width and depth, the Combat Synthetic Training Assessment Range is  being developed  for $1.2 million to provide tactical combat training for brigade commanders.

Of the  remaining  projects,  FY  1997  WRAP  provided  $3.4  million to  accelerate  by  twenty-one  months  the  fielding  of the  Army  Airborne Command and Control System, which  will  provide enhanced situational awareness for commanders from  brigade through corps through improved communications and mobility. A total  of  $5.84 million is helping to build nineteen prototypes  of the Avenger  Slew-to-Cue system, which  detects, targets,  and  engages  enemy  aircraft automatically  with  Stinger missiles. Two divisions will  receive 432  prototypes of the Palletizcd Load  System Enhanced, which provides the capability to pick up and transport 20-foot containers  without a flatrack,  owing  to  $3  million  in  FY  WRAP  funds. Applique,  a  digital battle  command  information  system  that  provides situational  awareness  information  in  near  real  time  to  tactical  leaders, received $4.3 million for  integration  into MlA2 and M2A3 brigades. The Tacticallnternct, which was developed for use during the Task Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment (AWE)  and  is the  primary data  link  in Force XXI, was funded with $8 million in FY 1997 for further development of  advanced digital transmission, particularly with respect to the Enhanced Position  Location Reporting System and the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). The final FY 1997 WRAP project, Radio Frequency Technology, wi II  provide the ability for the Army to track material through the distribution system.

A number of  new systems continued under development in FY  1997, particularly in  the arenas of  air defense, missiles and artillery, intelligence

assets, support vehicles, and command-and-control systems. The Theater High-Altitude  Area  Defense  (THAAD)  system,  which  will  form  the upper tier of theater air defense  while Patriot and other systems provide the  lower tier,  flew  seven flight  tests at White Sands Missile Range from April  1995 through March 1997 and conducted successful demonstrations during RoviNG SANDS in April 1997 and the Task Force XXI A  WE. The first unit is scheduled to be equipped with THAAD in FY 2006. A contract for $80 million  was awarded in October 1996 for the multinational Medium Extended  Air  Defense  System,  which  will  neutralize  tactical  ballistic missiles  and  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  with  ranges  of less  than  I  ,000 kilometers. The  first  U.S.  unit  will  be  equipped  with  the  system  in  FY 2007, while it will appear in Germany and Italy in FY 2005.

With  respect  to  missiles  and  artillery  systems,  the  Crusader  field artillery system remained the Army's top priority ground combat system under development in  FY  1997, as 824 separate subsystems were  being procured  and  fielded.  Numerous  initiatives  in  acquisition  reform  have saved the Army $4.5 billion in development costs in the Crusader program. In comparison with the system it replaces, Crusader will require a smaller crew and  provide greater range,  rate  of fire,  accuracy,  survivability,  and mobility.  Crusader wi ll  begin  production in FY  2003  and  be  fielded  in FY 2005.  In  May  1997  the Army Systems Acquisition Review  Council approved full-rate production (FRP) and a three-year procurement contract for the Javelin antitank missile system, a portable weapon  providing digital fire-and-forget  technology  for  early-entry  forces,  dismounted  infantry, combat engineers, and scouts that will replace the Dragon missile system. Low-rate  initial  production  (LRIP)  began  in  FY  1996.  A  seven-missile flight test  of  the  Line-of-Sight  Antitank  system,  which  incorporates forward-looking  infrared radar (FUR), an  improved  fiJe  control system, a  laser  communications  link,  and  improved  target and  missile  tracking, occurred at White Sands in  January  1997.  Developed for  the  HMMWV chassis, the system will be funded in the FY 1998 budget as an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) program.

Intelligence  assets  have  become  more  critical  as  the  Army  moves towards information dominance. The RAH- 66 Comanche helicopter, which completed its first flight with retracted landing gear in February 1997, will be  the Army's only armed reconnaissance system that can operate in  any weather,  day  or night,  in  high  altitudes  or  high  humidity;  that  is  highly survivable and  mobile; and that has an integrated targeting capability. The second prototype is  currently under development and is scheduled for its first flight in September 1998. The Advanced Quick:fix, a heliborne system that will  provide  brigade and  armored cavalry regiments with  an organic electronic warfare capability, entered LRIP in FY 1996. With three models in production at the end ofFY 1997, the Advanced Quickfix will  be tested

. in  FY 1998, at which time a decision on FRP will be rnade. In  May 1996 a contract was awarded for a two-year ACTD of  the Joint  Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Outrider, which will provide brigade commanders with the ability to conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition more than  100  kilometers  behind  the forward  line  of own  troops  (FLOT). Six outrider  systems,  each consisting  of four  air vehicles,  a  ground  control system,  modular  mission  payloads,  a  ground  data  terminal,  launch  and recovery equipment, and other ground support  equipment, will be  produced. Eight successful operational flights were conducted in FY 1997.

No  matter how technologically advanced the Army becomes,  it  must continue  to  have  a  fleet  of modern  support  vehicles.  The  Grizzly  M 1 Breacher, which entered the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD)  phase  in  December  1996 and  is  based  on  the Ml  tank chassis, will provide a capability for breaching simple and complex obstacles for maneuver forces on the move. The EMD phase ended in FY  1997 for the Bradley Fire Support Team (BFIST) Vehicle Thunderstrike, an integrated fire  support system on a Bradley chassis that will replace the M981 on an M113 chassis. LRlP is scheduled in FY  1998 for the M7 BFIST located on the Bradley A20DS (Operation D ESERT  STORM) version and FRP in FY 1999, whereas the M7  Al BFIST located on the Bradley - A3 is scheduled to begin  the EMD phase in FY 1998, LRIP in FY 2002, and FRP in FY 2003. In September 1996 the Army approved LRIP for 46 command-and› control vehicles to be delivered from FY 1997 through FY 2000 to replace the M577 and Ml 068. Five preproduction vehicles received quality.  testing of critical  subcomponents  during  the  fiscal year.  The Wolverine  (heavy assault  bridge),  mounted on an  Ml  chassis, received  approval  in  March 1997 to enter LRIP and will provide theAnny with the capability to support an Ml force over gaps up to twenty-four meters in width. The fielding of 10,843 medium tactical vehicles that began in FY 1996 continued during FY 1997, providing the Army with new 2.5- and 5-ton trucks on a common chassis. Production contracts for the 5-ton van and tanker models will  be awarded in FY 1998.

Theneedtoobtaininformationdominancehasincreasedtbereguirement for improved command-and-control systems. The Standardized Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) with five variants (tent, rigid-wall shelter, M 1068 tracked vehicle, 5-ton expandable van, and HMMWV)  remained under various stages of development and production. Housing the Army Tactical  Command  and  Control  System  maneuver  control,  the  forward area air defense command-and-control system, the advanced field artillery tactical  data  system,  and  the  combat service  support  control  system  in all variants, SICPS was fielded  in FY  1997  in  the  5-ton expandable van version. The Global Command and Control System, which provides a fused picture of  the battlefield to corps and joint task force commanders, became

operational on 30 August 1996. The automated system receives, correlates, and displays the tactical situation with  weather, force  position, and battle plan overlays, facilitating combat planning. A contract was awarded in FY 1997 for the Global Broadcast Service, a joint defense acquisition program that  will  augment other military satellite  communications  by  providing continuous, high-speed, one-way multimedia  information, including imagery,  maps, weather data,  logistics information, and  air taskings. The Shortstop Electronic Protection System, designed to provide surveillance against indirect fire munitions, was tested under live fire at Yuma Proving Ground  in  summer 1997. A decision on fielding  the system to  Korea  to meet an  urgent requirement will be made after studying the test data. The Close Combat Tactical Trainer, a system of  combat vehicle simulators that employs  interactive  technology  to  present a  simulated  battlefield  to  the crew, conducted a limited user test at Fort Hood during FY 1997.

Programs to upgrade Army systems also occurred throughout the fiscal year,  especially for combat vehicles,  missiles,  aircraft,  and  information› gathering  equipment.  A  system  enhancement program  is  continuing  to improve the M1A2 Abrams tank and eliminate the inventory of  older Mls by providing a digital computer capability, a gunner's  primary sight, FLIR upgrades,  and  a  thermal  management system. The  Bradley- A3  version entered into LRIP for 35 vehicles in FY 1997, with an option to purchase an additional  18 or more in FY  1998; an  FRP contract for 76 vehicles is expected in FY 1999. A major upgrade of914 Ml09A2/A3  155-mm. self› propelled howitzers to  the Paladin MJ09A6 continued  in  FY 1997. With an  onboard  ballistic  computer,  a  position/navigation  system,  automatic gun positioning,  and  digital commtmications  with  SINCGARS,  Paladin will  be  able  to receive  a fiJe  mission  on the  move,  stop, occupy a  firing position, compute firing data, unlock and point its cannon, deliver fire day or night, and move within 60 seconds.

The  Army  continued withnumerous  changes for its  missile  systems.  One of  the most important upgrades continued to be a system of  improvements to the engagement control station, radar, communications, and missile of the Patriot system, leading to the · Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC- 3). Conducted during FYs 1992-2006 at a cost of$1.8 billion for development and $4.2 billion for production, PAC- 3 is currently in production for radar enhancements; improved classification, discrimination, and identification of  targets; and upgraded communications equipment at the battalion level. The development of the new missile and  improvements in detection and surveillance are currently in  the EMD phase, with  production scheduled to  begin  in  FY  1998.  A  total  of $28.5  million  was  provided for PAC- 3 procurement  and  $45.1 million  for  RDTE  in  FY  1997.  The  second year of a  three-year demonstration and  validation  phase for  the  Stinger Block II, which will  eliminate clutter that reduces  the Stinger's ability to

acquire  targets,  occurred  in FY 1997,  financed  with $10.9  million.  The Longbow Hellfire system, theAnny's  first fire-and-forget precision missile for  attack helicopters,  began LRIP in July  1997. The Army will  procure l  ,056 Longbow  Hellfire  systems,  whose  missiles  are  guided  by· radio frequency and can operate in any environmental condition, as the primary armament for the AH- 64D Longbow Apache and the RAH- 66 Comanche helicopters. The Tube Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire Guided (TOW) missile system is being replaced by the Follow-on to TOW missile system, which  will  include  an  improved  target  acquisition  system  and  a  fire› and-forget capability  at greater ranges  than  the TOW.  During FY  1997 potential contractors conducted hardware performance demonstrations in preparation for the EMD phase beginning in FY  1998.

Modernization  of Army  aircraft  was  also  accomplished  through upgrades in FY 1997. For thirteen years the Army has been replacing OH58A/Cs and AH- 1 Cobra  helicopters  in  air cavalry squadrons and  light contingency forces with OH- 58D Kiowa Warriors. The Army's objective is  to  acquire 411  OH- 58Ds; dtu·ing FY  1997,  a  total  of 185  were  being upgraded  into  the  Kiowa Warrior configuration, which  includes  a  mast› mounted  sight,  a  thermal  imaging  system,  low-light-level  television,  a laser rangefinder/designator, and an embedded GPS navigation system. In an ef · fort to  convert all  1,150 of the  current CH-47D Chinook helicopter engines to a more powerful configuration that can lift an additional 3,900 pounds of  payload, the Army in February 1997 authorized the EMD phase of the  CH- 47D  Chinook  Engine Upgrade  Program and  a  LRIP  of 115 engine conversion kits  and aircraft modification  hardware.  Deliveries of the new CH- 47D- 714A engine will begin  in late FY 1998.

Enhancements to information-gathering equipment  continued to gather momentum. A contract for FRP of  the AN/TPQ- 36(V)8 Firefinder mortar› locating radar, which is currently in the production stage,  was awarded in August 1996. A program to  upgrade the antenna transmitter group of the AN/TPQ- 37 artillery locating  radar, which entered a milestone decision phase towards  the end of the fiscal  year,  is  likely  to  be  under contract in late FY 1998. Under LRIP that began in March 1997, second-generation FLIR technology  is  being inserted  into  new  and  existing platforms and will contribute towards fulfilling the Army's objective to "own the night." The program will  initially equip five  platforms with  the upgraded FLIR technology:  the  MlA2 gunner's primary  sight,  the  MlA2 commander's independent  thermal  viewer,  the  M2A3  improved  Bradley  acquisition subsystem,  the  M2A3  commander's independent viewer,  and  the  long› range advanced scout surveillance system. Another system to use second› generation FLIR technology  is  the  improved Target Acquisition System for TOW, increasing its target acquisition and engagement ranges. With an LRTP contract awarded on 30 September 1996, the first unit equipped with

the system will be fielded  in early  FY  I  998. The Warfighter Information Network, the Army's  communications, automation, and information system for the twenty-first century, will connect fighters  in foxholes  to CONUS power-projection bases using digital networks, cellular telephones, military satellites, unmanned aerial  vehicles, and other technologies. A prototype divisional  set of equipment is currently  under development and  will  be available for Division XXI AWEs in FY 1998.

Even  with  limited  funds, the  Army  persevered  with  a  variety  of developmental programs, the mostimportantresiding in the areas of  missiles and  information  gathering.  The  Joint  Precision  Strike  Demonstration program  is developing an  all-weather, day/night,  precision strike  missile capability  to  attack  any  target,  especially  from  extended  ranges,  and  is currently evaluating advanced precision strike technologies. The objective of the  MLRS  guided rocket advanced technology demonstration  (ATD) is  to  acquire  a  low-cost  guidance and  control system  for  the  extended› range  MLRS  free-flight rocket.  Concepts  from  the  guided MLRS ATD have been included in associated ACTDs, and the EMD phase will  begin in FY 1998. A test bed for Rapid Terrain Visualization, an ACTD program that  will provide  three-dimensional  computer-generated  scenes  of the battlefield, was established at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  During its first year,  the  program  was  used  in  six  exercises.  On  14  October  J  996,  the United States and the United Kingdom formally agreed to develop jointly the Future Scout and Cavalry System during a 3-'h-year  ATD. The U.S. Army will acquire  1,100 of the new vehicles, beginning in FY 2005, to replace the M3  Bradley, considered to  be  too  large  for  scout operations, and the HMMWV, which is  too vulnerable; neither vehicle bas adequate sensors for recom1aissance. The Joint Countermine ACTD, which focuses on achieving seamless amphibious operations among all military services, was led by the Army in FY 1997, with the primary focus on shallow water, beach, reconnaissance, and breaching operations. The Army incorporated its close-in, man-portable mine detector  ATD, which integrates infrared and ground penetrating radar, and the off-route smart-mine clearance ATD.

Army research laboratories play an important role in the ROTE process. In FY 1997 researchers from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory  (CRREL)  worked  at  the  South  Pole  to  demonstrate  the feasibility of  excavating a subsurface snow tunnel for the future U.S. South Pole station. CRREL also provided increased remote sensing capabilities to USACE  districts, improving water resources management and emergency flood support operations. The Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) participated in the Division XXI AWE with its Digital Topographic Support System  Multispectral Imagery Processor  in  both a  5-ton  and  a HMMWV version, demonstrating how topographic support can  enJ1ance the view of the battlefield.  In addition, TEC personnel assisted  the Army

Space Program Office in developing the Tactical Exploitation System, the next-generation  multi-intelligence  system  and  worked  with  the  National Reconnaissance Office on Eagle Vision II, a system of satellites that will receive,  process, and disseminate imagery products. The first  civil works digital  project  notebook,  which  provides  project  information  on  4,000 Army civil works projects, was created by TEC and available to users on desktop computers.

The Waterways  Experiment Station (WES) provided  $50 million of support to the Navy, Air Force, and other DOD agencies, including military hydrology and engineering support to forces deployed to Bosnia. A major WES  success in FY  1997, development  of a probe  to  detect  subsurface radioactive  contaminants, produced $800,000  in  savings for one  site and is  projected to save millions of  dollars in the future. A further $30 million in rehabilitation costs  were  avoided when a new procedure developed by WES determined that six water intake towers were structurally sound and did not need repair.  WES  performed more than  $100 million of research support  for  207  customers  and  negotiated  20  Cooperative  Research  and Development Agreements during the year.  In  addition, WES  initiated an outreach program for  100 minority students to  interest them in  a science or engineering career. To  enhance  its  abilities, WES  acquired  nearly  $30 million in new facilities for high performance computing, initiated operation of the  w.orld 's  most  powerful  centrifuge,  and  began  construction  of two major facilities for hazardous waste and analytical chemistry research.

## Support Services

## Morale,  Welfare, and Recreation

One of  the most critical programs in ensuring a good quality of  life for soldiers, civilians, and their families  is  Morale, Welfare,  and  Recreation (MWR), through which social, recreational, and fitness  opportunities are provided. The U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center (CFSC), a  field  operating  agency  of the  Office  of the  Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, oversees MWR programs under the auspices of the  MWR Board of Directors. The board,  composed of the  commanders of  Forces  Command  (FORSCOM),  Training  and  Doctrine  Command (TRADOC), Eighth U.S. Army, Army Materiel  Command, United States Army, Europe (USAREUR), and United States Army, Pacific (USARPAC), as  well as the sergeant major of  the Army, monitors the financial  status of MWR and approves major nonappropriated fund (NAF) construction. FY 1997 proved to be the most financially successful year for MWR in recent years, exceeding budget predictions with a net income before depreciation of$75.8 million, versus $65.1 million in FY 1996. In addition, the stringent financial  requirements  placed  by  the  board  for  FY  1999  were  met  two years early by installations and major commands.

New  guidance  was  issued  in  FY  1997  that  changed  some  ways  in which  MWR operated.  In  July  1997  commanders  received  authority  to use  appropriated  funds  (APF)  for  MWR programs,  which  are  normally conducted through NAF.  CFSC worked with the Department of the Army (DA) and Department of Defense (DOD) to develop guidance that would meetlegalandaccountabilityrequirements;DAguidanceforimplementation is likely to take place in FY 1998. The MWR Board of  Directors approved the receipt of  earnings from tobacco sales in commissaries as a new source of  income for Army MWR funds. TheDA also approved an MWR initiative to  sell commercial advertising on the Internet as an additional method for generating income to  support programs for soldiers. The Army stipulated that all equipment, staff, computer servers, and other support must be paid for  by  NAF;  websites  with  advertising  must  not  appear official; and  no paid advertising may appear on websites funded with APF.

Approval  for  entering  into  public-private  ventures  was  given  in  FY 1997,  allowing  installations  the  opportunity  to  obtain  partners  in  the private sector to  supplement MWR facilities and services without capital investments  from  NAF.  In  exchange  for  access  to  MWR's market  and  a long-term  land  lease,  the  private-sector partner agrees  to  finance,  build, operate, or maintain an MWR facility or program. MWR has established partnerships with municipalities and private businesses to construct twenty› four facilitiescar washes, guesthouses, golf courses, outdoor recreation facilities, family entertainment centers, and movie theatersthat will save the Army $150 million while improving support to soldiers.

In  another type  of business  venture,  CFSC  negotiated  the  sale  of two golf courses  at  Fort  Ord,  California,  to  the  city  of Seaside,  California. Special legislation permitted the Army to sell the property as a result of  the realignment of Fort Ord under base realignment and closure (BRAC). This was  the  first  occasion  in  which  an  MWR activity  was  sold  to  the  private sector at fair market value. The revenues received from the sale were paid to the Presidio of  Monterey, California, for support oflocal MWR programs.

To  meet the  needs  of Force XXI,  an  MWR strategic action plan  set out  the  initiatives  that  program  managers  must  pursue  to  meet  Army performance  improvement  criteria  (APIC)  and  satisfy  customers.  APIC provide  a  mechanism  through  which  installations  and  organizations  can assess their strengths and weaknesses with respect to customer satisfaction. All Army  installations  must conduct  their first  annual  APIC  assessment during FY  1998. Adapted from  the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award  criteria, APIC  have  been  integrated  into  the  Army  Communities of Excellence  program,  which  assesses  excellence  in  Army  installations based on continuous improvement in customer service and satisfaction.

As  another  measure  of the  quality  of MWR  offerings,  the  Army conducted a survey in FY 1997 that depicted the rate at which beneficiaries used  the  MWR programs and  services. The Army  hopes  to  increase the usage rates to the goals shown in Table 31.

In one of its restructurings, the Army in May  1996 created the CFSC Hospitality Directorate as an umbrella organization for all lodging functions in the  service.  In  August  1997,  another  reorganization  established  the separate Army Lodging Directorate. The new organization  is  responsible for overseeing  25,000  rooms  at 101 locations, including  temporary lodging, guesthouses,  and  recreational  lodging on Army  installations.  In addition,  the  Lodging  Directorate  manages  the  Army  Lodging  Success Program  through  the  Army  Central  Reservation  Center.  At  the  Armed Forces Recreation  Centers in Bavaria,  Germany,  the deployment  of soldiers  to  Bosnia  and  Hungary  decreased  patronage,  while  a  series  of special  reduced-rate  vacation  packages to  reunite deployed  soldiers with family  members contributed to  the  net loss  of $1.2  million. During  1997

the  Dragon  Hill  Lodge,  Seoul,  Korea,  received  the  Silver Award  from the  Educational  Institute  of the  American Hotel  and  Motel Association for  its  achievements  in  measuring  customer service,  meeting  customer service performance standards, and providing certification and education opportunities  for  hotel  staff. The  success  of the  Dragon  Hill  Lodge  is indicated  by  its  98.9  percent occupancy  rate  and  a  net  income  of $6. 1 million in FY 1997.

The Army Family Action  Plan  (AFAP)a  grassroots  program that involves  active  duty,  reserve,  and  retired  soldiers,  along  with  civilians and  family  membersis  one  of the  Army's most effective  methods  to achieve change. By participating in AFAP-sponsored conferences,  these individuals can raise issues and recommend solutions that will affect their own quality of  life, providing commanders with insight into the areas that need improvement. Most AFAP issues are resolved at local levels, creating improvements  for  Army-wide  communities  on  a  continuing  basis. The remaining issues are forwarded  for resolution to DA, where they result in changes to legislation and improvements in policy, programs, and services. During fourteen years of  existence, the AFAP process has resulted in fifty pieces of  legislation providing quality-of-life benefits to all of  the services. Delegates to the March 1997 biennial AFAP Planning Conference voted a tax-deferred military savings plan as their top issue.

Army  Family  Team  Building  (AFTB)  is  a  program  coordinated  by CFSC to enhance the preparedness of  soldiers and  their family members. Through  three  training  tracksactive-duty  soldiers,  civilian  personnel, and family  members  in  both the active and reserve componentsAFTB ensures that everyone associated  with the active component can receive inf ormation that will  faci litate  an  adjustment  to Army  life, mobilization

and deployment, and personal and  professional development. The soldier track  is  conducted  on  five  levels (pre-entry, entry, junior  leader,  leader, and  senior  leader) at TRADOC schools,  with  a  revision  of programs  of instruction  having  occurred  by  July  1997.  The  Directorate  of Civilian Personnel conducts  a  correspondence  course  for  selected  civilians  who may  deploy  or their  supervisors.  CFSC  coordinates  the  fami ly  member track,  taught  by  family  member  volunteers  who  arc  trained  as  Master Trainers at Levels I, II, and Ill, which correspond to the various degrees of exposure attendees have had to the Army. AFTB training is attended on a voluntary basis and cannot be required. At the headquarters level, the U.S. Army CFSC implemented the AFTB Senior Spouse Leadership Seminar at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the Army War College. A total of  655 volunteers were  trained  in  the  seminar and  the  Master Trainer Course. At  the  local level,  about  21,400  family  members participated  in  Levels I, Il  and  III. Levels 1  and ll were translated  into Spanish, German, and Korean during the year,  with Level III scheduled for translation the following year.

In  response to  lessons learned  from Operation DGSERT  STORM,  CFSC instituted  the Operation  READY  program  to  prepare soldiers and  families for deployment, homecoming, and reunion. CFSC provided familiarization training  on  Operation RGADY procedures  in FY 1997  to 300  Army Community Service (ACS) staff members, Family Support Group (FSG) members, and  rear detachment commanders and  is also preparing a FSG leader's guide.

ACS contains five core competencies, or readiness cells, as  outlined in its  strategic  action  plan: mobi lization/deployment  readiness,  family advocacy/exceptional  fam ily member  programs,  relocation readiness, financial  readiness,  and  employment  readiness. During a deployment  or emergency,  ACS  expands  its services  to  become  the  Family Assistance Center  (FAC),  which  is  responsible  for  providing  assistance,  guidance, information, and referral to units, soldiers, civilians, and family members. Trained  professionals  from  key  community  agenciesthe Dependent Eligibility Emollrnent  Reporting System, Finance, the Staff  Judge Advocate,  the Red Cross, Social Work Services, and others as needed› arc  available  within  or  to  the  FAC.  A specially  designated  I  lomccoming and  Reunion  Team  assists  installations  in  preparing  for  the  return  of deployed soldiers and their integration back into family life.  In addition to training the FSG  to  refer family members to  necessary outreach services and  information, the ACS  in  FY 1 997 conducted the first ACS  Directors' Training Exercise Without Troops, focusing on  resolving  problems  that may arise during deployment.

MWR also  supported  soldiers  during  deployment and  mobilization, with  the first  group  of MWR civilian  specialists assigned  to  Bosnia and Hungary  for  120  days  in 1996.  At  the  end  of FY  1997,  a  total  of 69

volunteer MWR specialists were present in  theater,  supporting soldiers serving  in  Operation JOINT  GuARD. To  boost  morale,  provide  a  creative outlet, and develop artwork representative of  soldiers, MWR  sponsored the Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR/JOINT  GuARD cartoon contest between August 1996 and  March  1997. The first place winners, chosen from  100 entries in two categories (novice and accomplished) and four divisions (black and white single fi·ame,  black and  white strip,  color single frame,  and  color strip), received $500.

The  concerns  of an  Army  force  with  63 percent  married  service members, most of  whom have children, and 4 percent single parent service members necessitate offering affordable, high-quality Child Development Services (CDS) and Youth  Services.  Since passage of the  1989 Military Child Care Act, the Army has focused on improving quality, availability, and affordability of  child care services. Nevertheless, in FY 1997 the Army could meet only 64 percent of its  members' requirements for child care. This is  expected  to  increase  to  65  percent in FY  1998,  which  will  meet the DOD goal. To meet the demand, the Army encouraged the use of  off› post child care programs and authorized care for special-needs children in Family Child Care homes. At the beginning ofFY 1998, the NAF subsidy per child  care  space will  be  reduced  from  $200 to  $100,  and APF  will provide $100 per child care space; when the NAF subsidy is  phased out entirely  in  FY 2000,  the subsidy  will  be  supported  completely  by  APF. Patron fees will continue to pay the remainder of  the costs.

In  response  to  a  presidential  directive  in April 1997  for  military services to share information on their child care programs with the private sector, the Army provided training, resource materials, a speaker's bureau, and  fifty-five  documents  for  potential  distribution.  Recognizing  that  an increasing part of  the nation's youth is at a higher risk for teen pregnancy, substance abuse, violence, academic underachievement, and health disorders,  the Army  is  transforming its Youth  Services  to  provide  more than the traditional sports and recreational activities. On 1 September 1997 the DA established a requirement for installation commanders to  publish a  home-alone policy  identifying  the  circumstances  under  which  a  child younger than twelve years old can be left at home without supervision. The policy must include times in which children are not in school, such as school vacations, and should include input from CDS and Youth Services staff, the family advocacy office, housing personnel, and the provost marshal.

In June 1997 the First  Annual Supporting  the  Military Child Conference was held at Fort Hood, jointly sponsored by Fort Hood and the Killeen Independent School District, Texas, and attended  by one hundred participants. Conferees hoped to develop a system to support students of mi  i  tary families who transfer to a new school district; an alliance of  school I districts; mutual support between school districts and military installations;

and  procedures  for  sharing  information  between  school  districts  with military students. Participants found  that a lack of  standardization results in an ineff1cient  transfer  of academic  records  and  students;  delays  in interpreting  student  transcripts  and  frequent  loss  of credit;  inability  to distinguish between different types of  schools; inadequate communication systems  between  the  school, the  military,  and  parents; and  inconsistent education as a result of widely divergent curricula. Conference participants agreed to establish a system linking legislation, policies, and  resources; a clearinghouse for issues and  information; an action plan; and an executive steering committee.

In  Army entertainment, the service obtained exclusive  rights to stage the  international  premiere  of A  Tale  of  Cinderella, which  took  place on 4 April  1997 in Vicenza,  Italy. The New York  producer, composers,  and lyricist flew  in  for the opening night, which was attended by  high-ranking mi litary  personnel,  Italian  dignitaries,  and media  representatives.  The Army, with  1,700 performances of 200 plays and  musicals worldwide, is the largest theater producer in  the world.

Creating efficiencies in  the service's  sports program, the Army World Class Athlete  Program  was  formed  into a  military  detachment stationed at Fort Carson,  Colorado,  where soldiers  could  use  nearby  lop  training facilities for boxing,  wrestling,  Tae  Kwon  Do,  and  other  sports. In addition,  the  move  provided the opportunity to  train  and  compete at the U.S.  Olympics training complex  in  Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The Army Athletes of the Y ear for  FY  1997  were Specialist Niambi Dennis and Staff Sergeant James Todd Graves. Dennis was the first soldier in  two decades to win the national track and field title. She was also named the Armed Forces Female Athlete of  the Year, sharing the title with a Navy athlete.  Graves, a member of the U.S.  Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU), won nati. onal titles in skeet, trap, and double trap and has competed twice in  the  Olympics. This  was  the  second  consecutive  year  that  an  AMU soldier was named the Army Athlete of  the Year. Staff  Sergeant Cassandra H.  Howard,  a  basketball  player, was  inducted  into  the Amateur Athletic Union; this was the first time that a soldier had received this high honor.

## Health and Medical

Of the  five  interdependent  Army  Medical  Department  (AMEDD) imperativesreadiness,  organization,  managed  care,  quality/efficiency, and technologymedical readiness is of  the utmost importance. To ensure the abi lity to keep soldiers healthy and fit,AMEDD soughtto maintain a full spectrum of  services for deployment, provide routine medical  and dental care,  procure and  train  the right  mix  of health care providers, assess and acquire technology, and obtain sufficient resources. With  an  increasingly

severe  shortfall  in  health  care  providers,  especially  of physicians  and dentists in reserve component  units, correcting medical readiness deficiencies  was AMEDD's top priority  in  FY 1997. The task was made more difficult, however, when the medical recruiting mission was moved to the US. Army Recruiting Command. To alleviate the shortage, AMEDD continued to introduce initiatives to integrate the reserve components into the total AMEDD force.

Although  AMEDD  has  conducted  a  radical  reengineering  over  the last  four  years,  creating  a  streamlined  organization  by  "rightsizing" organizations with an efficient combination of  skills,  future  refinements and  adjustments  are  expected.  In  addition  to  creating  seven  regional medical  commands that helped  to  integrate smoothly  all  medical  units, AMEDD is now reevaluating the number and locations of the commands and planning to realign them with Army corps. Training infrastructure not linked to medical readiness will be reduced. In another initiative, AMEDD is  considering  the  possibility  of combining  the  Office  of the  Surgeon General and  the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Command  in  San Antonio, Texas. The two organizations are complementary, and the single-staff study will determine the most efficient way to reduce duplication without eliminating functions.

Like all other  Army organizations, AMEDD is building its organization to meet the requirements of  a smaller, faster, and more flexible force under the  tenets  of Force XXI.  At the AMEDD  center and  school,  a  medical reengineering  initiative  is  aligning  medical  assets  with  the  new  Army structure  and  warfighting  doctr.ine. In addition,  AMEDD  is  developing capability-based  contingency  teams  to provide  specialized  skills for handling  chemical-biological  incidents,  burns,  stress  management,  and preventive  medicine.  Immediately  upon  notification  of a  contingency operation,  designated  teams  will  be  sent  to  the  area  of operations  and begin  providing medical care while awaiting the arrival  of larger teams. Having recognized  that coalition warfare  will occur more frequently  in the  future,  AMEDD  has  initiated  efforts  to  cooperate  with  the  military medical organizations  of other riations  to  facilitate  an understanding of each other's capabilities and deficiencies.

To  keep pace with the  modernization concepts of Army XXI  and to compensate for  shrinking resources, AMEDD  continued  in FY 1997 to focus on researching and  integrating technology, as it has done for the last decade.  Advanced  communications  technology  has  proven  particularly vital in providing health promotion information to  soldiers wherever they are stationed and is expected to  improve the dissemination of nutritional information and motivational messages so that soldiers can attain healthier lifestyles. One of  the most important new applications of  technology on  the battlefield will  be the UH- 60Q medevac (medical evacuation) helicopter,

which will  increase  AMEDD's ability  to  remove  casualties quickly  and provide medical care en  route to  military treatment facilities (MTF). The prototype for a small personnel-status monitor has been developed and will assist medical personnel  in  identifying,  locating,  and  removing  from  the battlefield  personnel  who exhibit signs of  physical distress before serious illness or  injury occurs.

Preventive medicine has proven to be a true force multiplier, minimizing the  number of deaths  and  injuries  not  attributed  to  battlefield  loss.  The Center  for Health  Promotion  and Preventive Medicine  at  Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland,  has been directly responsible for the low rate of illness and injury among the soldiers deployed to Bosnia by  providing information  that  helped  keep  troops  well.  Although  these  individuals served  in  harsh  conditions,  where environmental  pollution was  prevalent and a medical  infrastructure was virtually nonexistent,  fewer complained of sickness  than  did  soldiers  in  the continental  United  States  (CONUS). The Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine has now turned its attention  towards educating soldiers in  CONUS to switch  to  healthier lifestyles.

The usc of illegal drugs in  the Army remained a concern, particularly since the rate of  specimens testing positive increased from 0.99 percent in FY 1996 to I. 14 percent in FY  1997. The rate in the active Army rose from 0.61  percent to  0.77 percent;  in  the Army National Guard  (ARNG) from 2.93 percent to 3.04 percent; and in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) from 2.52  percent to  2.59  percent. The  rate  in  the civilian  workforce  declined from  2.5 1 percent  to  2.35  percent.  Nevertheless,  the Army  drug-testing program remained an active and aggressive means to deter illegal drug use and  to  provide a legal  defense for removing drug abusers from  the force. The number of  specimens tested and the number and percentage proved to be positive for each Army component during FY  1997 (Table 32).

Table 32Anny Drug Testing Program, Fiscal Year  1997

|                    | Active Army   | Army National Guard   | U.S. Army Reserve   | Civilian   | Total     |

| SpecimensTested    | 1,024,585     | 155,881               | 53,829              | 9,186      | 1,243,481 |
| Positive Specimens | 7,874         | 4,739                 | 1,394               | 216        | 14,223    |

To reduce high-risk behavior, the Army has instituted a Risk Reduction Program, which was originated by For! Campbell's  Army Drug and A coho! I Prevention  Control  Program  office  in 1993  to  reduce  an unusual ly  high level  of incidents. At the end  of FY 1997,  the  Risk  Reduction  Program, implemented  at  twenty-two  FORSCOM,  TRADOC,  USARPAC,  and

U.S.Army,  South,  installations,  reached  52  percent of all  Army soldiers. Consolidating  all  readily  available  data  on  sundry  incidentsdriving while  intoxicated/driving  under the  influence, crimes against  persons  or property,  child  or spousal  abuse,  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  financial problems, and others-an incident rate is computed for each battalion on a quarterly basis. Division and installation commanders receive information on  an  installation  level,  while  brigade  commanders  receive  information on each subordinate battalion.  Battalions with the highest risk profiles are designated to  receive interventions  for  the next two quarters,  which  may include prevention education, leader training, and counseling of  troops by leaders. Using the Risk Reduction Program, high-risk behaviors have been reduced. At the same time, economics in personnel have accrued as human services  staff can  focus  on  targeted  battalions  and  unit  leaders can  rely more heavily on  installation staff members.

The  installation  Prevention  Team  Training  course,  implemented  in 1996, was another effort to  reduce high-risk behavior on  an  installation› wide  basis.  Developed  by  the  U.S. Army  Center  for  Substance  Abuse Programs,  this  three-day  course  provides  instruction  to  teams  of key installation personnel authorized to commit installation resources for substance  abuse  prevention. Each  team  developed  an integrated fnstallation  Prevention Plan and  briefed  it to  the  installation commander upon  its return. By the end of  FY  1 997, a total of  400 military and civilian personnel  from  43  installations  had  been  trained  in  14  iterations  of the course.  These  personnel  represented  installation  functions  such as  drug and  alcohol  prevention  control, safety, Equal  Employment  Opportunity, Provost Marshal, ACS,  Civilian Personnel Office, Chaplaincy, preventive medicine, social work services, family advocacy, and the Judge Advocate General.  In  1997 a five-day course was developed for ARNG.

The  military  has  followed  the  civilian  sector  in  using  the  HMO (health management  organization) concept. The  Army has worked extensively with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to tailorTRICARE, the HMO system that will replace CHAM PUS (Civilian  Health  and  Medical  Program  of the  Uniformed  Services),  for different  segments of the Army  population.  All  active duty  soldiers will be enrolled at no  cost in TRICARE Prime, which ensures medical care at the nearest MTF. Retirees and fam ily members may sign up  forTRT CARE Prime  for  $230  per  individual  and  $460  per family.  With  the  least cost, TRICARE Prime provides the  least choice of provider. Under TRfCARE Extra,  beneficiaries  receive discounts  when  using the  preferred  provider network;  under TRICARE Standard,  they pay the highest costs but have free  choice  of any  authorized  provider.  Neither  TRICARE  Extra  nor TRICARE Standard includes an enrollment fee. With contracts for the last three  regions  awarded  in  September  1997,  all  twelve TRICARE  regions

will  be  operational  in  May  1998.  A  demonstration  of  TRICARE Prime Remote,  providing TRJCARE Prime to persons serving at locations  far from an MTF, is taking place in one of  the regions.

TRICARE has a mail  order pharmacy option, but on 5 August 1997 DOD announced the award of  a contract to Merck-Medco Managed Care, fne.,  to  implement a  National Mail Order Pharmacy (NMOP)  program. Although this was a best-value procurement in which teclmical merit was more important than price, DOD expects to save money by maximizing the use of"Best Federal" pricing of  up to fifty percent below wholesale prices. This pricing is not available to the TRICARE contractors. Services under the  contract are  to  begin  on 6  October  1997. Eventually,  all TRICARE beneficiaries will be able to use NMOP, but it is currently limited to active duty  members;  CHAMPUS  beneficiaries  in  Alaska  or  Puerto  Rico  or with  military  overseas  addresses;  some TRICARE  Prime  beneficiaries; and some  Medicare-eligible  beneficiaries.  Active  duty  soldiers  will  pay nothing, but their family  members will  pay $4 per filled prescription; aU other beneficiaries will pay $8.

Army retirees have long been concerned about the loss ofCI-JAMPUS, and nowTRICARE, eligibility when they turn 65 years old and are forced to  use  Medicare.  The  Budget Reconciliation  Act  of  1997  authorized  a demonstration  of Medicare subvention  beginning  1 February  1998.  The Army is currently working in concert with other DOD entities to support a  test  program  that  can  later  be  implemented,  with  a  memorandum  of agreement due to Congress on 1  November 1997. The test will be conducted at six  locations  and,  if successful,  will  be extended  to  all CHAMPUS› eligible or TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries, providing them medical care comparable to what they received before turning 65  years of  age.

## Army Chaplaincy

The Chaplain Corps was deeply involved in Army XXI modernization and  the Army After Next  initiatives during FY J 997,  particularly  with integrating  new  technology. Having  relocated  from  Fort  Monmouth, New Jersey, as a result of the base closure process in FY 1996, the Army Chaplain  Center  and  School  at  Fort  Jackson,  South  Carolina,  moved into  its  new  state-of-the-art Chaplain  School complex, with completely modern  computers and  coJmnunications,  in  April  and  May  1997.  The complex  was  formally  dedicated  on  23  July  1997  and  named  Watters Hall in memory of  Charles J. Watters, a Roman Catholic priest and Army chaplain  who  was  posthumously  awarded  the  Medal  of Honor for  his actions in the Vietnam War.

One of  the primary issues for the chaplaincy during FY 1997 concerned the  integration  of reserve  component  chaplains  with  the  active  Army.

Reserve component chaplains have  been  sent to Bosnia to support JOINT GUARD and  are  working  beside active Army  chaplains. Lessons  learned about  the  training  needs  of both  reserve  component  and  active  Army chaplains for mobilization and  deployment are being integrated into new training strategies at the Chaplain Center and School.

## Army Pay

The  most significant  change  in  f'Y  1997  with  respect  to  Army  pay was the integration of  pay and personnel functions. Finance and personnel functions were automated thirty years ago with separate systems, although both  used  many of the same data elements. In today's era of constrained resources, such duplication  is  too  expensive  to  maintain.  Moreover, the high operati ng tempo experienced by Army units today necessitates a more accurate and timely system. As a result, the Army decided to combine pay and  personnel. The new system, which will  be :fielded in FY 1998 and will support deployed units as well  as  those at home,  is expected  to  eliminate many  mobilization  problems,  serve  all  Army  components,  reduce  debt and  fraud, provide better controls, improve customer service, and increase database reconciliation and accuracy.

## Army Housing

Improving  housing  for  married  and  single  soldiers  remained the Army's most  important objective  in  its effort to  provide  a  better  quality of  ife.  Two  separate  avenues arc being  used  to  ensure that soldiers have I adequate  living  accommodations.  Under  replacement,  existing  housing units  arc  demolished  and  new  units  are  constructed  to  replace  them. Through revitalization, existing units arc renovated to current standards. In both  approaches,  energy  conservation,  infrastructure,  and  neighborhood improvements  are  included.  The  Army  projected  a  need  to  replace  or revitalize  3,400  Army  family  housing  (AFH)  units  during  FY  1997  but was only  able to  upgrade  1,746, falling far  short of its  requirement. The AFU Construction Program executed in FY  1997 is given in Table 33.

As a result of insufficient funding  to cover the cost of bringing AFH units  to  current standards  or constructing an  additional l0,322  housing units,  the  Army  began  an  effort  to  privatize  all  AFH  replacement  and revitalization by the end ofFY  2003 under the authority of  the 1996 Military Housing  Privatization  Initiative  Act. This  legislation  allows  the  military services to  contract with the private sector to operate, maintain,  improve, and  construct  military  housing.  Analysis  had  shown  that  privatization could  fix  the deficiencies in AFH in five to ten years, while the Army had no hope of  ever doing so on its own. The Army established

a  Capital Venture  fnitiativc  (CVJ)  team  in  FY  1 997  and  obtained  DOD approval  to  develop  Fort Carson  as a  CVr project, with a contract to  be awarded in  FY  1998. Over a five-year period, the contractor will build 840 new houses and  revitalize  1 ,824, owning and operating the inventory and collecting rent from the occupants in an amount not to exceed their housing allowance.  The  CVI  team  started on  a  new  project at Fort  Hood, Texas, and developed  fifteen additional projects during FY  1997. If approved by DOD, these new projects will affect 52,97 1  AFH  units, 63  percent of the Army's fami ly housing.

The  1996 Military Housing Privatization Initiative Act applied only to AFH in CONUS.  In overseas areas, A  FH is currently on a cycle in  which replacement or revitalization will not occur for 130 years. If  the Overseas I  lousing Authority receives approval to privatize such activities, the Army

believes  AFH can  be  placed  on a  cycle  of 30 to  40 years,  a  significant improvement.  In  January  1997,  the  chief of staff of the  Army  and  the secretary  of the  Army  approved  a  proposal  to  transfer  all  foreign-area housing to  the Overseas Housing Authority by FY 2003.  DOD approval is  expected in early FY  1998, and the proposal will then be submitted for congressional enactment in FY 1999 legislation.

ln  the  effort  to  improve Army  housing, the Army's highest priority among facilities remained the Army 13arracks Program. At the end of  FY 1997, a  total of  $2  billion  was  invested  in  the design  or construction  of 82 barracks projects at 23  CONUS and 21 overseas installations that will provide new or renovated accommodations for 22,000 soldiers. Contracts were awarded in  FY  1997 to  replace or revitalize  I  0,607 barracks spaces, meeting the Army's goal  of 10,600  spaces  as  outlined  in  the  Barracks Modernization Plan. The FY  1997  construction  program  included  $270 million for  barracks  modernization of 5,000 spaces that will  be ready for occupancy in  FY  1998. Many of the Army's barracks built between 1975 and  1985 can be  renovated  under the Barracks  Upgrade  Program,  using Operations and Maintenance, Army,  funds,  rather than replaced under the Whole Barracks Renewal Program, requiring military construction funds. APF  and  host-nation  funds  are  being  used  overseas  to  bring  existing barracks to current standards.  For the first  time since the  late  1980s, two new  barracks are  being  built  in  Germany.  In  all  cases,  DA  is  providing $40 million a year to purchase new furnishings for all renovated or newly constructed barracks faci I  ities.

## Army Safety Program

Safety has become  an increasing concern as Army  personnel resources  hae  declined.  During FY  1997  the  DA' s  Casualty  Operations Center received  reports  of 502 deaths among Army personnel.  Of  these, 297  deaths  were  among  soldiers  in  the  active  and  reserve  components, 35 among civilians, 88 among retirees or separatees (who had  left active duty  in  the previous  120 days), and 82 among persons on the Temporary/ Permanent Disability  Retired  List.  Among  the components,  226  deaths occurred  in  the active Army,  34 in  USAR, and 37 in ARNG. This was a significant  decrease  from  FY  1996,  when  380  soldiers and  40  civilians died.  In  addition, 95 soldiers were reported as seriously or very seriously injured  or ill  in  FY 1997.  Of the soldiers who died  in  FY  1997, illness accounted for 77 deaths, homicide for 19, suicide for 50, accidents for 146, and undetermined causes for 5. Training-related accidents caused 60 of  the accidental  deaths:  vehicle accidents,  I I;  parachute accidents,  4;  aircraft accidents,  14;  physical  training accidents,  15;  heart attacks, 8; and  other types of  accidents, 8.

The  Army  must  sometimes  conduct  Line  of  Duty  Tnvestigations (LODI)  to  determine whether an  injury or death  was  within  the  bounds of an  individual's  military  service.  Timely  processing is essential  to ensure that survivors of  the deceased receive appropriate bene· fits from the Department of  Veterans Affairs. ln addition, for soldiers  being separated under the Physical Disability System, the Army attempts  to avoid paying unnecessary  medical  bills,  pay,  or  allowances.  ln  FY  1997  the  Army received  301 LODI  cases  due  to  death  and  closed  300;  received  1,366 cases for Physical Evaluation Boards and closed 787; received 429 cases due to disease or injury and closed 530; and received and closed 9 cases for the Army Board for Correction of Military Records.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Services

Although gross income for the Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES) increased from  $6.9  billion  in  FY  1996 to $7.2  billion  in  FY 1997, earnings from retail, food, service, mail order, and concession sales declined  from  $348  million to  $337  million.  From this  profit, a  total  of $232 million was distributed to the military services for MWR and other programs.  The  Army,  which  had  received  $132.9  million  in  FY  1996, collected $ 139.1  million, despite the reduced profits.

AAFES continued to support U.S.  personnel serving  in  contingency operations around the  world.  In  Haiti, one retail store  remains present to support the U.S. Support Group-Haiti and the American Embassy until the mission in  that country is complete. With the opening of  a new retail store at AI  Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, and a new retail store with food service and gift shops at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, AAFES was operating nine retail stores and three smaller activities in those two countries at the end of the fiscal year. In  Bosnia, AAFES operated seventeen retail stores, including  two  new  ones  in  Sarajevo.  ln support of the  3,000 Army,  Air Force,  and  Marine  Corps  troops  deployed  to  Egypt  for  45  days  during BRIGIIT  STAR,  AAFES  worked  with  Third  U.S.  Army  to  establish  and operate  facilities  at  four  separate  locations.  AAFES  was  also  present supporting  USAR and ARNG soldiers  in  El Salvador and  Honduras  as they performed humanitarian missions.

Expanding  on  the  need  to  provide low-cost  quality  cycwear,  eye exams, and contact lens exams and fittings  in  Europe, AAFES proceeded with its development of  vision centers that would provide customers with glasses at one-half to  two-thirds  the  price they  were  previously  paying. The  first vision  center was  constructed at Coleman  Barracks, Germany, and opened in July  1997, staffed with  licensed optometrists and opticians. Servicing 45,000 customers, the  laboratory can provide same-day service for most standard orders and safe  polycarbonate lenses for children at the

same price  as  plastic  lenses.  l  n  September  1997  the  optometry  service at Yogelweh converted from  a contract arrangement to an AAFES vision center, with the optical shop to follow suit in summer 1 998. A third vision center  will open  in  December  1997  at  Mainz-Kastel  and  a  fourth  in Wlirzberg in  1999.

## Command Information

During the fiscal year, the Office of  the ChiefofPublicAffairs sponsored thirty media representatives on nine trips to Bosnia and Hungary to ignite regional  media  interest and  educate Americans  on  the Army's mission. The media representatives were linked with soldiers from their hometowns who were currently deployed to Bosnia or Hungary. As a result, more than one  hundred stories  later appeared  in  fifteen  media markets.  In  support of soldiers  deployed  or stationed  overseas,  the Hometown News  Service created traveling teams that collected more than seven thousand individual greetings from  service  members  on  videotape and disseminated  them  as television spots in the United States in  the Holiday Greetings Program.

The official  magazine of the U.S.  Army, Soldiers, changed its format in  1997.  Under a new printing contract, the magazine's size was reduced from  56  to  48  pages,  and  one-third  of the  black-and-white  pages  were eliminated. The  new format allows for full  color to  be  used  on  the cover and on  1 6 pages, while the remaining 32 pages will be printed in two colors (black plus an additional color). The January  1997 issue was pub  I  ished as The Soldiers Almanac, with 56 pages of  ful l  color. With digital photography increasing in  quality and with contract photo laboratories becoming more affordable, Soldiers closed  its  darkroom.  Soldiers  Online,  the  £nternet site for  the magazine, was a source of information for 2.5 million visitors during FY 1997.

The  Army  provided  personnel,  equipment,  advice,  or  locations  for various films and television shows. Air Force One, Conlacl, Batman, Wild America, Saving Private Ryan, Thin  Red Line, and Asteroid all  drew on such support.

## Army Tuition Assistance Progratn

As  a means  to  support readiness,  recruitment, retention,  and  quality of  I i!c, the Army  Continuing Education  System  offers educational opportunities  for  soldiers,  civilians,  and  family  members.  In  FY  1997, the  program  was  delivered  by 117  Army  education  centers  and 151 Army  learning centers,  including locations in  Honduras, Southwest Asia, Bosnia, and  Macedonia. The Army Tuition Assistance policy  in FY  1997 reimbursed  every  eligible soldier  for  75  percent  of the  tuition  cost  for

fifteen  semester hours. The Tuition Assistance funding limit for noncredit courses increased from  $750 to $1,200 per fiscal  year.  An  increase  in  the number of soldiers enrolled  in  Tuition Assistance  increased  in  FY  1997 to  2 1 5,000  from  200,000  in  FY 1996,  which  had  itself decreased  from 236,000  in  FY  I  995  owing  to  the  . large  number of USAREUR  soldiers deployed to JOINT ENDEAVOR.

In other educational changes, Public Law 104- 276, enacted 6 October 1996,  provided  soldiers  the  opportunity  to  switch  from the  Veterans Educational  Assistance  Program  to  the  Montgomery  G.J.  Bill,  which provides  a  larger amount of financial  assistance.  Half  of the  twenty-one thousand soldiers eligible for the conversion did so; the opportunity expires on 8 October 1997. The Army also raised the maximum amount of  student loans that can be  reimbursed  under the Army  Loan  Repayment  Program from $55,000 to $65,000. Army Emergency Relief  reversed a long-standing policy, permitting a pilot test of providing education assistance to spouses in  USAREUR for the academic term that began in fall  1997.

## Total Army Quality

Since  its  adoption  as  the  Army's management  philosophy  in  1992, Total  Army  Quality  has evolved  into a  leadership  tool  for  change. APIC enhance Total Army Quality by providing a means for planning, assessing, and training; raising performance expectations; and establishing common performance  criteria.  For  the  third  year  in  a  row,  the  Army  won  the Presidential  Award  for  Quality,  the  federal  government  equivalent  to the  Malcolm  Baldridge National Quality  Award.  In  1997  the U.S.  Army Infantry Center and Fort Benning received the award.

## Special Functions

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

In  addition  to  its  usual  activities,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of Engineers (USACE),  like  many  Army  organizations,  deployed  assets  overseas  to support contingency  operations  and  other activities.  ln Bosnia,  USACE personnel helped  to  meet requirements  for  needed  facilities, real estate, and logistics. They worked with United States Army, Europe (USAREUR) (Forward), and the 1st  Armored Division to integrate the corps'  engineering and construction contracting expertise into Operation JOINT GuARD.  In the U.S.  Central Command area of responsibility, USACE provided  program management,  design,  and  construction  expertise  for  Operation  DESERT Focus, relocating U.S. forces from congested urban areas to facilities where they could be more easily  protected.ln other  efforts, USACE is constructing an air base in Egypt and building barracks, training faci lities, ammunition bunkers, and runways in Latin America, as well as renovating hospitals in various  countries.  In  the  United  States,  USACE  recently  completed  the new  Brooke Army Medical Center  in  San  Antonio,  an  eight-story,  $288 million hospital completed within budget and ahead of  schedule.

To  improve  its  workflow  and  maintain  a geographic  balance,  in  FY 1997 USACE streamlined  its  divisions  and  realigned  some  subordinate offices.  In  one  initiative,  USACE  established  a  reinvention  center  for district  installation support at  its  Fort  Worth,  Texas,  district  office.  The USACE director  of military  programs  structured  his  stair along  major command (MACOM)  lines, establishing an  advocate for each MACOM within his headquarters at the assistant director level. In another initiative, a USACE representative was assigned to each major installation, located with  the  director  of public  works,  to  rei nforce  the  partnership  between the two activities. USACE began conducting video teleconferences in  FY 1997 with selected directors of pub ic  works to ensure thal the fu ll  range I of support that installations  require can  be  provided.  Having established that life-cycle management principles are now an  integral part of USACE operations, US ACE will support an installation's  facility or environmental project from beginning to end.

Like  other Army  organizations,  USACE  has  developed  a  strategic vision and plan to  enable  it to  serve  the Army  and  the nation efficiently and effectively as the transition occurs from Force XXI to the Army After Next. The commander, USACE, and other senior leaders will frequently assess  the  progress  made  towards  achieving  concrete  milestones  in  the command  action  plan.  To  rectify  the  past situation  in  which  USACE engineering, infrastructure, and real estate capabilities have been overlooked or underutilized during mobilization, USACE has established three initiatives. It is worldng more closely with the Training and Doctrine Command and  the  U.S.  Army Engineer Center and  School to  recognize US  ACE's battlefield role in joint and Army doctrine, to refine mobilization capabilities and procedures, and to  use technology  to  improve teamwork and customer service. In the technology initiative, USACE is restructming itself into  a  virtual organization that  can respond  to  customers  without regard to their location and whatever their needs. In future years, USACE will be  conducting  massive  changes  in its organizations,  processes, corporate culture, and technology to achieve this virtual capability.

With  respect to  technology,  the  Directorate of Information  Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers formed  a year 2000  (Y2K)  Project  Team  in  1996  to  focus  on  computers,  networks, software,  and  telecommunjcations.  In  spring  1997  several  MACOMs began independently to  develop and issue guidance for  their subordinate commands  and installations with respect to their non-information technology  infrastructure.  MACOMs  pushed  Headquarters,  Department of the  Army  (HQDA),  to  address Y2K  non-IT  issues,  particularly  the responsibiJ ities of a  MACOM  with  organizations  located  at  another MACOM's  installation, the creation of  a central repository of  infrastructure compliance  information,  and  the  designation  of one  I- IQDA  agency  as a  point of contact  for  infrastructure  issues.  The  information  technology infrastructure  was  defined  as computers,  networks,  and telecommunications, with the non-information technology infrastructure defined as installation systems such as heating and air conditioning, traffic lights, and fire alarms. Computers used primarily for word processing and e-mail were designated as information technology systems, while those that ran sewage plants or environmental controls were classified as non-information technology.  In September 1997 the Office of  the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) agreed to host a meeting with the MACOMs to discuss Y2K and installation non-information technology infrastructure.

During  FY 1997 a major  effort  occurred  at Force Command (FORSCOM)  installations to manage costs through activity-based costing, a new performance-based approach implemented by OACSIM to determine the costs of installation  base  operations services. Establishing the program required the training of  installation personnel, the development

of  an automated database of installation service costs, and participation in a  Managerial  Costing  Steering  Committee. The XVIII Airborne  Corps, designated  to implement  the  prototype  of  activity-based  costing  for FORSCOM,  reengineered  its  installation  organizational  structure  into core business areas. FORSCOM fielded activity-based costing to all XVIII Airborne  Corps  installations  in  FY  1997  and  began  fielding  models  to III  Corps  units  in  summer  1997.  A  comprehensive  managerial  costing training package was developed by the assistant secretary of  the Army for financial management and comptroller and will be available on CD- ROM and the Internet.

In another effort to reduce costs, the Army has been steadily working since 1985 to decrease its energy consumption by 30 percent by 2005. By using the latest technologies and energy-efficient  equipment, implementing utility  partnership  programs and  other cooperative projects with private firms,  reducing electrical power consumption, and increasing the amount of natural gas  consumption with respect to  other fuel  sources, the Army expects to attain its goal. By FY 1997, the Army had decreased its energy consumption since 1985  by 20.9 percent; a 2 percent reduction occurred between  FY  1996  and  FY  1997.  The  Army  used  the  savings  accrued through reduced energy consumption to pay for higher fuel  costs.

In addition to concern about energy consumption, the Army, as one of the largest property owners in the United States, must also keep abreast of fluctuations in real estate prices. In FY  1997 USACE provided extensive real  estate  appraisal support  for  the  Army,  particularly  with  respect  to U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) centers, the Community and Family Support Center, USAREUR, and the potential acquisition of the Kahuku Training Range, Hawaii. In addition, real estate appraisal support was provided  to numerous USACE civil works projects, especially ecosystem restoration efforts in southern  Florida. USACE also conducted  real estate appraisal support for other federal agencies, such as the Defense Logistics Agency and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The Army also  requires  services similar to  those  provided  by  real estate  agents. USACE  provided  assistance  in  relocating  US.  Army Southern Command headquarters from Panama to Miami by executing an interim lease for 150,000 square feet of  office space costing $1.7 million in annual rent. For force protection of  the headquarters, USACE obtained congressional approval  to  lease adjacent land. To  support the  relocation of personnel,  USACE  initiated  lease  actions  for  60  unaccompanied personnel housing units, 62 family housing units, and 8 key and essential housing units in  Miami. In other military acquisitions, USACE began the process of  leasing 100,000 square feet in Southbridge, Massachusetts, for training, administration,  lodging, and  dining operations. The new lease will  provide a facility for the Department of  Defense (DOD) Executive

Management  Training  Center  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  the Defense Financing and Accounting Service and the Defense Leadership and Management Program.

When  military  and  federal  civilian  homeowners  are  unable  to  sell their homes owing to the adverse effect on the market of  a base closure or realignment, the Homeowners Assistance Program provides some financial assistance,  sometimes  through  the outright  purchase  of  homes.  The secretary of  the Army is the DOD Executive Agent  for the program, which is administered by USACE for all military services and defense agencies. To determine market impacts and appraise homes of  qualified applicants, USACE provided extensive real estate appraisal support. USACE acquired 540  homes  and  provided  financial  assistance to 840  other homeowners near 20 military  installations in continental  United States (CONUS) and Europe. The purchased homes were resold for $83.1  million, which will be used to fund future benefits under the program. In FY l  997 implementation of  the program was approved for Oahu, Hawaii; McClellan Air Force Base, California; Seneca Al"my  Depot, New York;  China Lake Naval Weapons Test Station, California; Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Pennsylvania; and San Diego Naval Facilities, California.

The USACE Contingency Real  Estate Support Team,  composed  of realty  specialists,  appraisers,  and  attorneys  who  volunteer to serve from various corps division and district offices, provided real estate and facility acquisition support to  obtain lodging, administrative,  hardstand,  covered storage, and maintenance space during exercises and contingencies. Team personnel prepared the  real  estate  parts of contingency operations  plans and  participated  in  MACOM,  Unified  Command,  and  Joint  Chiefs  of Staff  exercises and conferences in FY 1997. Additionally, team personnel continued their deployment in Bosnia, supporting Army units participating in JoiNT GuARD. Four members were deployed on  I  20-day tours to Bosnia, living  with  Army  personnel  and  acquiring  real  estate  and  facilities  for units serving in  Bosnia. The team worked for the real estate office of the USAREUR deputy chief of  staff  for engineering.

Under the Civil Works Program, USACE develops, manages, protects, and  enhances water and  related  land  resources, in cooperation with federal,  state,  and  local  agencies,  to  reduce flood  damage,  restore the environment, and improve commercial navigation.  USACE provides planning,  engineering,  environmental,  recreational,  research,  and  real estate services to  federal  and  civilian  agencies  in  peacetime and  during emergencies. To carry out one of  the Civil Works Program's  primary roles, that of protecting U.S. waters,  USACE regulates the discharge of dredge and fill material.

In  FY 1997  USACE  operated  and  maintained 12,000 miles  of commercial  navigation  channels  and  275 navigation  lock  chambers;

maintained 299 deep-draft and  627  shallow-draft harbors;  and  operated 383 major lakes and reservoirs, 75  hydroelectric power plants (24 percent of the  nation's hydroelectric  plants),  and  4,330  recreation  areas  at 456 USACE local protection projects. Visits to  the recreation  areas generated $10  billion  in  income and  provided  600,000 jobs.  During  FY  1997,  an additional 491 Civil Works projects were under construction.

The FY  1997 Civil Works Program appropriation was $4.107 billion, including an additional $585 million passed in supplemental appropriations in June 1997 for emergency operations. Funds were distributed as follows: $1.082 billion for  general construction; $1.866 billion  for  general operations and  maintenance; $330 million for the  Mississippi  River and  tributaries; $154 million  for general  investigations;  $101  million  for  the  regulatory program; $425 million for :flood control and coastal emergencies; and $149 million for other projects. USACE also received $198.9 million, primarily through cost-sharing agreements, in nonfederal cash contributions.

Congress had directed USACE to reduce its division offtces from  13 to not Jess than 6 or more than 8, and this was accomplished in April 1997. The Ohio River and North Central Divisions were combined to create the new Great Lakes and Ohio River Division; the Lower Mississippi Valley Division was  renamed the Mississippi Valley Division; the St. Paul and Rock Island Districts were  transferred  from  the North Central Division to  the Mississippi Valley Division; the New England Division became a district under the North Atlantic Division; the North Pacific and Missouri River  Divisions  were  combined  to  form  the  Northwestern  Division; the Alaska  District  transferred  to  the  Pacific  Ocean  Division;  and  the Albuquerque  District  was  transferred  to  the  South  Pacific  Division. USACE will continue to restructure the divisions in the future to achieve savings.

Normally,  only  three  or  fewer  major  river  basins  experience  major storms  in  one  year,  resulting  in  an  average  of $4.3  billion in  damages. During FY 1997 severe storms hit eight major river basins that affect half of the United States.  US ACE participated in major emergency operations involving :flooding in northern California and western Nevada; flooding of the Ohio and Mississippi River Basins; :flooding in the state ofWashington; :flooding  in  North  Dakota,  South  Dakota,  and  Minnesota;  a  tornado  in Arkansas; high water at Devils Lake, South Dakota; :flooding of the James River in South Dakota; and high water and :flooding of the Great Lakes. Because ofUSACE water projects&gt;  :flood damages in FY 1997 were limited to  $8.9  billion,  while  $45.2  billion  in  damages  were  estimated to  have been prevented. The efforts of  USACE helped  to  hold down  the  number of  flood-related fatalities  to  ninety-eighta  10 percent increase over the annual average of  eighty-nine for the preceding ten-year periodin a year with an unusually high incidence of  :flooding.

Through  the  Flood  Plain  Management  Services  Program,  USACE helps states, Native American tribes, and local governments to develop and execute plans to reduce flood damages. During FY 1997 USACE provided 42,000  responses  to  requests  for  assistance.  USACE  also  performed 82  studies  of water  resources  for  34 states and  10  studies  for  9 Native American  tribes,  providing  technical  assistance  and  planning  guidance for wetlands identification, environmental restoration, water supply, water quality,  and  flood  damage  reduction. A  total  of $3 15,700  was  spent on studies pertaining to the beneficial  uses of  dredged  material,  while $1 0.3 million  was  spent on  project modifications  to  improve  the  environment. Of the  latter,  4  projects  were  completed,  9  projects  were  approved  for construction, and 23 new studies were initiated.

In its capacity of  protecting U.S. waters, USACE regulates construction and  other  work  in  navigable  waterways  and  controls  the  discharge  of dredged  or fill  material  under  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act Amendments  of 1972.  In  December  1996,  USACE  implemented  new nationwide permits  to  improve  protection of wetlands,  with Nationwide Permit 26 (accounting for  15  percent of all permits) limiting the amount of  fill  in  water to  three acres of  material instead of the ten acres that had previously been allowed. In FY  1997 USACE regulatory offices approved 5,062 standard permits and 2,985  letter permits, and denied 200 permits. USACE approved  38,006 activities  under  regional  general  permits  and 39,943 activities under nationwide permits.

The  Mississippi  River  Basin  drainage  area  affects  41 percent  of CONUS.  Although  USACE  operates  a  large  number  of  reservoirs, levees,  floodways,  and  flow  diversion  structures  in  the  basin for  flood control  and  navigation,  advanced  tools  were  recognized  as essential  to improve operation  and  management during extreme  natural conditions. Tn  FY  1997 USACE completed development of a computer simulation model for the entire Mississippi River Basin, from  St. Paul, Minnesota, to  the  Gulf of Mexico,  that  can  predict flood  flows  and  provide  real› time  information  on  how  to  minimize  damage.  The  model  is  divided into six areas or reaches, each of which can be run independently by the responsible division or district office or integrated into an entire picture. Forecasting river stages in real time, the model can also help evaluate the effects of  alternate levees or construction and levee breaches during flood stages. The Floodplain Management Assessment Study used the model to evaluate levee alternatives during flood stages. Two districts have applied to use the model for real-time flood  forecasts, and USACE is developing new applications of  the model for the Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Services Center.

The Water Resource Development  Act of  1996 established the National Dam Safety Program and  required  the  Federal Emergency  Management

Agency to · submit an implementation  plan to Congress within 270 days. As  one  of the  major owners  of dams  among federal  agencies, USACE served on the team preparing the plan, basing its input on its Civil Works Dam Safety Program. The plan established an  Interagency Committee on Dam Safety, to  which the USACE Dam Safety Officer became the DOD representative.

## Environmental Protection

The Army recognizes  that environmental stewardship  is  an  integral part of its  military  mission  and  works  to  integrate environmental values into Army missions, as well as to  implement cost-effective measures that protect  the environment  while still enabling military operations, installation management, and the fielding and acquisition of  material. Environmental stewardship is accomplished through compliance, conservation, pollution prevention, and restoration. Compliance ensures that all applicable federal and  state  regulations  have  been  met;  conservation  fosters  the  deliberate management of  natural and cultural resources; pollution prevention reduces future compliance costs; and  restoration  removes existing contamination to protect people and the environment.

One of the  Army's objectives  has  been to  reduce  its  environmental program  costs  by  25  percent  from  FY  1996  to  FY  2003  through  an increased emphasis on pollution prevention, which would reduce the costs of compliance.  During FY  1997,  however,  compliance costs  were $591 million, as compared with $589 million in FY 1996, demonstrating little change. After FY 2003, the Army expects to achieve a sustained annual reduction  of $200  million  in  enviromnental  costs.  As  one  indication of compliance,  the Army received  217  new  enforcement actions  in  FY 1997,  continuing  the  decrease  from  previous  years.  In  FY  1996  the Axmy  received 221  new enforcement actions;  in  FY  1995,  320;  and  in FY 1994, 360. These reductions are attributed to the improved awareness of environmental  responsibilities  among  Army  installations  and  their compliance  with  statutory  regulations,  as  well  as  the  establishment  of Regional Environmental Offices.

One of the  most important compliance issues concerns underground storage tanks. As required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of  1976, the Army has been working to eliminate by 22 December 1998 the number of underground storage tanks not in compliance with  regulatory standards. From a high of 5,436 tanks not in compliance in FY 1994, the Army has reduced the number to 1,440 in FY 1997. During the fiscal year, the Army developed several initiatives to assess  the  underground storage tank  program  status  and  focus  resources  to  ensure compliance  no  later than 30 September 1  998.

A  new  area  in  which the military must  meet  compliance  was established during FY 1997. After years of  coordination with the military services and DOD, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the Military Munitions Rule in February 1997. The rule identifies when military munitions are  considered hazardous waste and establishes procedures  for  their  safe  storage  and  transportation.  A  joint  service Munitions Rule Implementation Council developed an interim policy for DOD implementation of the new rule, which became effective in August 1997. The interim policy was coordinated with state regulators to identify state concerns and gain state adoption of  the final rule.

The  Army  continued  to exert  efforts towards  conservation  and pollution prevention. One of the Army's strategies for conservation is to develop and implement integrated natural  resources  management plans at all  appropriate installations  by FY 2000. These plans will  provide for the sustained use of  Army property to conduct the mission, to  achieve an appropriate quality of life, and to  provide for recreational opportunities. At  the  end  of FY  1997,  40  of  189  installations  possessed  approved plans.  In another strategy,  the Army  required its  installations to develop and  implement  integrated  cultural  resources  management plans  by  FY 2001  for  the protection  of historic and  archaeological  assets.  Approved plans  were  in  place  at the  end  of FY  1997  at  51  of 176  installations. A  third  strategy  required  the  completion  of pollution  prevention plans at  Army  installations  and  MACOMs.  By the  end  of FY  1997,  141  of 164  installations  and  11  of 13  MACOMs  bad  an  initial  draft  of their plan  completed.  An  additional  strategy  called  for  the  development  of relative  risk evaluations for contaminated sites to  determine the  cost of and to establish the priority for restoration. About 50 contaminated sites remained without such risk assessments in FY 1997 but are expected to be completed in FY 1998.

In another conservation initiative, the Department  of  Defense Appropriations Act for  1997 required each service to  review  its historic quarters,  provide a  plan for  removing all but the most  significant from the inventory, and describe statutory obstacles that would  prevent implementation of  the plan. In December 1997 the assistant chief  of  staff for installation  management  approved  implementation  of the  Historic Quarters Cost Reduction  Strategy, which  would reduce historic  property management  costs  through  a  Regulatory  Affairs  Plan,  a  Maintenance and  Repair  Cost  Control  Plan,  and  an  Inventory  Reduction  Plan.  The Regulatory Affairs Plan will streamline and internalize Army compliance with the National Historical Preservation Act.  Under the Maintenance and Repair Cost Control Plan, the true costs of  historic building management will  be determined to maximize the use of  funds. The Inventory Reduction Plan proposes to retain historic buildings that support installation activities

while removing those that lack strong historic significance, are unusable, or arc not economically viable.

Important  initiatives  have  also  been  developed  to  assist  the  Army in pollution  prevention.  The  hazardous  material  management  program (I !MMP) is a commander's program  that uses the best business practices throughout the  life cycle of hazardous materials on an  installation, from procurement to disposal, to reduce risks to personnel and the environment and  to  ensure  compliance  with  federal,  state,  and  local  laws.  Through HMMP,  installations  will  reduce their purchases of hazardous  materials, improve  tracking  of  hazardous  materials,  monitor  the shelf  life  of hazardous materials more effectively, and eliminate unnecessary hazardous material  disposal  costs. All  Army  installations are required  to  implement an  llMMP  by  FY  2003;  by  the end  of FY  1997,48 of 160  installations had implemented  some  type  of an  liMMP  The  Hazardous  Substance Management System (HSMS), a software and hardware system that was implemented  in  FY  1996,  is  a  DOD  automated  system  that  manages, tracks,  and  reports hazardous  material,  enabling an  installation  to  retain effective control of its  hazardous  materials. At the end  of FY  1997, ten installations were using HSMS for at least one tenant organization, and an additional seventeen installations were implementing the system.

Following  a  decision  in I  996  to  decentralize  the  functions  of the Defense  Environmental Restoration  Account  to  the  individual  military services, the Army accepted complete responsibility for and implemented its installation restoration  program.  The  Army  Environmental Center delegated  management  of execution  of  the  environmental  restoration program  to  MACOMs  in 1 997.  During  the  first  year  of decentralized operations, MACOMs  exceeded expectations in executing planned activities, reducing high relative risk sites, and developing closer relations  with  regulatory agencies.  On  the National  Priorities List of  the Environmental Restoration program, the Army at the beginning ofFY 1997 had 35  installations designated, of  which 23  belonged to the active Army and  I  2 were installations being closed or realigned under base realignment and  closure  actions.  Nine  sites,  at  which all  construction  is expected  to be  completed  by  FY 2000,  were  proposed  in  FY  1997  for  the National Priorities  List.  These  installations  arc  Schofield  Barracks,  !Jawaii;  Fort Dix, New Jersey; Sacramento Army  Depot, California; Aberdeen Proving Ground (Michaelsville Landfill), Maryland; Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant,  Texas;  Tooele  Army  Depot,  Utah;  Louisiana  Army  Ammunition Plant; and  Fort Lewis and Umatilla Army Depot, Washington.

The secretary of defense  selected  numerous Army  installations and personnel  as  recipients  of the  I  997  Environmental  Security  Awards  to be presented in April  1998. Fort Sill, Oklahoma, won  the  Environmental Quality Award  for a nonindustrial  installation; Maj.  Donald F. Archibald

of the  133d  Preventive Medicine Detachment in Heidelberg,  Germany, received  the  individual  award.  The  Pollution  Prevention  Award  for  a nonindustrial installation was awarded  to Fort Carson and Pinon Canyon Maneuver  Site,  Colorado.  Jaycee  W.  Turnquist  of Fort  Hood  won  the individual award  for  recycling,  while  the  Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant, California, won the Environmental Cleanup Award in the installation category.  For the Natural ResouJces Conservation Award given to  a large installation, Fort Stewart/Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, was the winner. Fort Hood received the Cultural Resources Management Award  given to an  installation,  and Alan J.  Wormser of the Texas  Army National Guard received  the  individual  award.  Other Army installations  and individuals received honorable mentions in the categories in which they were not the winners of  the DOD award.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The DOD has established goals for the value of  prime contracts that military services must award to small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses. Since the creation of the DOD Small Business Program nine years  ago,  the  percentage  and  value  of procurement contracts  awarded to small businesses  has  substantially  increased,  despite  the  fact  that government contracting has decreased in nearly every area. In FY 1997, 28.8  percent of all  Army  procurement contracts  were awarded to  small businesses, accounting for $7.6 billion. Of  the small business contracts, 9.6 percent of  them, worth $2.56 billion, were awarded to small disadvantaged businesses.  In  addition, the  Small Business  Subcontracting  Program achieved success during FY  1997. Of the total $2.5 billion subcontracted by  prime contractors, $1 .7 billion was awarded to  small businesses, $260 million to  small disadvantaged  businesses, and $2 11  million  to  women› owned small businesses.

Contributing  to  the  success  of the  Small  Business  Subcontracting Program  is the DOD  Pilot  Mentor-Protege  Program.  The  program encourages prime contractors to serve as mentors to develop the technical and business capabilities of  small disadvantaged business owners and other eligible candidates so that they can succeed as DOD contractors. Mentors, who  receive  reimbursement  of costs  or  credit  towards  subcontracting goals,  develop  and  implement a  developmental  assistance plan  to  help the  protege compete for DOD prime and subcontract awards. The Army has approved thirty-tlu-ee mentor-protege  agreements, with mentors representing environmental, manufacturing, telecommunications, and health care industries.

Under the DOD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program, the Army has created the 8(a) GraduatePilotMentor-Protege Program. Firms that have graduated

from the Small Business Administration's  8(a) program, designed to assist small disadvantaged businesses, and other successful small disadvantaged businesses are recruited to mentor emerging 8(a) firms. Although mentors under  the  DOD  program  normally  must  have  an  active  subcontracting plan, this requi~:ement has been waived to permit up to ten 8(a) graduates to  serve as mentors. Five mentor-protege agreements have been approved under this new Army initiative.

Within  DOD,  the  Army  provides  the  most  technical  and  financial assistance  to  historically  black  colleges  and  universities  (HBCU)  and minority institutions (MI). The Army has established a goal of providing HBCU/Mis with 5 percent  of  the total funds it  awards to institutions ofhigher learning. In FY 1997, for the eighth consecutive year, the Army surpassed its goal by awarding 9.2 percent, or $38.4 million, to HBCU/Mls. Although this  was  a  slight decrease of 0.2  percent of all  funds  the Army awarded to institutions of higher learning in  FY  1996, the total  amount disbursed to  HBCU/Mls increased  significantly,  by  $10.4  million.  The amount of funding ranged from $30,000 to more than $2 million for 38 HBCUs and 12  Mls. The Army Medical Research and  Material Command allocated more than 6 percent of its FY  1997 breast/prostate cancer research funds to  HBCUs and Mls. Multiyear funding has continued to support centers of excellence  at Contra  Costa College,  California; Tuskegee  University, Alabama; and Grambling University, Louisiana. Each center of  excellence has  specialized  in  an area of scientific ~:esearch of interest to  the Army. Contra Costa supports math, science, and engineering programs; Tuskegee, advanced materials; and Grambling, advanced simulation.

## Legal Affairs

Following allegations of  sexual misconduct against drill  instructors at Aberdeen Proving Ground and noncommissioned officers at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Secretary of  the Army Togo D. West Jr.  on 22 November 1996 announced the formation of  a nine-member Senior Review Panel on Sexual  Harassment  to  conduct a  comprehensive  review  of the  service's policies on sexual harassment and current processes. Secretary West also directed  the  Army  Inspector  General  to  investigate  and  assess  current sexual  harassment  policies  and  procedures  at  all  basic  and  advanced individual training  installations and throughout the Army's training base. Already intense news media coverage of  these events increased in February 1997 when  Sgt.  Maj.  Brenda Hoster filed  charges of sexual misconduct and harassment against Sergeant Major of the Army Gene C. McKinney, a  member  of the  Senior  Review  Panel.  McKinney  was  subsequently suspended  from  his duties  and  had  a  preliminary  hearing  to  determine whether he should be court-martialed  The Office ofThe Judge Advocate

General  (OTJAG)  provided support for  the  panel's work,  responded  to congressional  inquiries, coordina~d corrective  actions,  and prepared materials for related chain teaching.

Of the  major  courts-martial  in  FY  1997,  one  series  involved  the allegations  of sexual misconduct  at  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground.  From November 1996 to the end ofFY 1997, an investigation of47 drill sergeants and  cadre  members  was  conducted  to  determine  their  involvement  in sexual misconduct with basic trainees  before  1 January  1997. Five drill sergeants and a company commander were tried and convicted by court› martial,  with sentences ranging  from  a  two-grade  reduction  in  rank  to 25  years confinement and a  dishonorable discharge.  Some charges were not  substantiated  by  the  investigation;  but for  those  substantiated,  the individuals  received  nonjudicial  punishment,  an  adverse  evaluation,  a letter of  reprimand, counseling, a bar to reenlistment, or a discharge.

Another major court-martial, conducted by the 3d Infantry Division, found  Spc.  Michael New guilty  of disobeying an order to  wear a United Nations  badge,  patch, and  beret. New had claimed  the order was  illegal because  it violated the  13th  Amendment to  the  Constitution.  He further claimed that the order to deploy to Macedonia to support a UN operation was unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia and  the  District  of Columbia  Circuit  Court  refused  to  stop  the  court› martial, and New was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge.

The total  number of courts-martial declined  for  the  sixth consecutive year, and the number of  nonjudicial punishments increased for the first time in  ten  years.  Although  the  rate  of courts-martial per every  1,000 soldiers declined  in FY 1997  from  FY  1996, the  rate  of nonjudicial  punishments per  1,000  increased  from  74.18  in  FY  1996  to  82.21 in  FY  1997.  The continued decline in courts-martial since FY  I  992 and the sudden increase in nonjudicial punishments that occurred in FY 1997 are given in Table 34.

The Army acted as the Executive Agent for the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice, which conducted a required  annual  revicwofthcManual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and proposed and evaluated amendments to the Uniform Code of  Military Justice and the MCM. Ten proposed changes to the  MCM  were published in  the Federal Register in  May  1 997,  with  the most significant ones creating a limited  psychotherapist-patient privilege, increasing  the  penalty  for  hate  crimes,  and  recognizing  the  offense  of reckless endangerment. By July  1997 the committee had  reviewed public comments submitted on the proposed changes.

The Army and the other services staff ed a proposed executive order that would  provide Article 32 investigating officers the authority to  investigate uncharged crimes discovered during an investigation. The order would also remove  the  limit on punishment that  a federal  court could  impose  on  a civilian  witness  who  refused  to  appear or testify  before  a court-martial. In  other changes, the order would  reduce  the  delay  in  punishment taking effect, terminate pay for soldiers serving certain sentences in confinement, authorize the transfer of  pay to dependents of  a confined soldier for up to six months, and make flight from  apprehension a criminal offense. Moreover, the order would  change carnal  knowledge to a gender-neutral offense and allow certain prior acts of  sexual misconduct to be admitted into evidence.

In 1995  the  secretary  of defense  directed  the  service  secretaries  to conduct functional exchanges with  the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA),  particularly  with respect  to military  jurisprudence.  Although discussions were  conducted,  visits were  initially postponed. On  26 February  1997, General  Dennis .1. Reimer  met with  his counterpart, Lt. Gen.  Kui  Fulin, and  agreed  to  initiate  such contacts.  Although  the PLA proposed in Aprill997 that a Military Justice Delegation be sent to China during August  1997, the visit  was scheduled for  14-21  September  1997. Judge Advocate General  Maj.  Gen.  Walter  B.  Huffman  led  a delegation of four judge advocate specialists in military justice and international and operational  law  on  the  first  legal  counterpart  visit  to  China  to  develop the  framework  for  future  bilateral  exchanges. The  Chinese  lawyers were particularly  interested  in  acquisition  and  contract  law,  international and operational law, and the Law ofWar. A reciprocal visit by Chinese military lawyers to the United States is scheduled for May 1998.

The  Standards  of Conduct  Office  performed  its  dual mission  of providing policy guidance for the Army's ethics  program and oversight of the  Army's professional  responsibility  program.  In  October  1996 the  Standards  of Conduct  Branch  conducted  the  third  annual  Ethics Counselor Workshop  at  The  Judge  Advocate  General's School, Army, in Charlottesville,  Virginia,  providing  training  to  190  ethics  attorneys from  all  military services. In  addition, the branch processed 386  written actions and 2,759 oral  inquiries that addressed the misuse of  government

resources  and  position,  gifts, conflicts of  interest, travel  gratuities, gifts  of travel  from  nonfederal  sources,  relations  with  and  support  to private  organizations,  job-hunting,  and  post-govenunent  employment restrictions.  Attorneys  in  the  branch also  reviewed  657  public  and 456 confidential financial  disclosure reports to  identify and  prevent conflicts of interest between official duties and private financial  interests. As part of its  oversight  of  attorney  conduct,  the  Professional  Responsibility Branch processed 23  professional misconduct inquiries  involving Army lawyers.  Seventeen  of the  cases  were  unfounded.  Of the  six  cases  in which professional misconduct was found,  three involved only minor or technical violations of attorneys' ethical rules. Approximately one-third of the  inquiries concerned the conduct of trial or defense counsel, while one involved allegations against a military judge.

The Contract Appeals  Division  represents  the Army  in  all  appeals before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) and in all  bid protests,  except those pertaining to the Army  Materiel Command or USACE,  brought before  the  General Accounting Office  (GAO). The number of  appeals declined from 392 in FY 1996 to 255  in FY 1997, and the bid protests numbered 195 in FY 1996, compared with 206 in FY 1997. The division also supervised and supported the Army Bonds Team, which reviewed and approved 4,429 payment and performance bonds on Army contracts. The Army Bonds Team, created in 1935, will be eliminated on I October 1997, at which time bonds will be forwarded to  the field without review; the division  is,  however, requesting a change to the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to require loc. allegal review.

In January 1997 the Court of  Federal Claims obtained jurisdiction over post-award protests, and Cubic Applications, Inc., filed the first lawsuit that same month protesting to  GAO and seeking  it'\iunctiv e  relief against the Army's $25.9 million award  to Logicon RDA  for warfighting simulation services at various USAREUR battle simulation centers. Both the protest and the  request for injunctive  relief were denied.  In  the Appeal of  Lora! Aerospace Co1p., in  which Lora!  sought $40  million,  the ASBCA  held that the claim for alleged deficiencies in the  technical data package was denied because of a contractual requirement for the contractor to review and correct any deficiencies.  Loral appealed the decision to  the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The ASBCA has not yet reached a decision in  the Appeal  of  McDonnell  Douglas  Electronics  Corp., in  which  the contractor requested $41 million dming a March  1997 trial  in connection with a  classified  contract. The Court of Appeals for  the  Federal  Circuit affirmed in FY 1996 the ASBCA ruling that refused to award McDonnell Douglas $15 million in another appeal on a classified contract.

The Defense Appellate Division provides appellate defense counsel to accused persons in the criminal appeals process, providing representation

before the  U.S.  Army  Court of Appeals  (754 soldiers  in  FY  1997),  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (330 soldiers  in  FY 1997), and the U.S. Supreme Court. In United States v. Loving, division counsel represented  Sgt.  James  Murphy in  a  capital case  before  the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for  the  Armed  Forces.  Murphy  had  been tried  in  Frankfurt, Germany, in  1987 and convicted of the premeditated murder of  his wife, her son, and his son. The case was argued in May 1997, and a decision has not yet been made.

OTJAG's  Environmental Law Division  represents the Army in lawsuits involving  the environment. In Chemical Weapons Working Group,  et a/., v. United  States,  et  a/., several  public  interest  groups  sought  to  close operations at the Tooele Chemical Demilitarization Facility in  Utah. The plaintiffs had filed  motions in October 1996 for an expedited appeal and a stay pending the appeal; the U.S.  Court of  Appeals for the  lOth  Circuit granted  the  motion for an expedited  appeal  but denied  the motion for a stay and, subsequently, in  April 1997 denied the appeal. The plaintiffs filed consolidated motions in January 1997 in the U.S. District Court for a stay pending appeal and a second preliminary injunction, both of which were denied in March  1997.  ln June 1997 trial was set for  17- 28 August 1998, and in July plaintiffs filed a second compl. aint.

In May 1997 EPA Region lX assessed monetary penalties against Fort Shafter, Hawaii,  for violations of underground storage tank regulations in its first such assessment against a DOD facility. DOD maintained that EPA could not issue field citations to federal agencies. The Environmental Law Division  advised  Fort Shafter to pay the  penalty  under protest while  the dispute is pending resolution by the Department of  Justice. In another issue, in  July 1997 the state of  Alaska charged two Army officers formerly assigned to  the 2d Battalion,  1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Lewis, with environmental  criminal  charges  for  diesel  fuel  spills  that  had  occurred during February  1996. Although a cotnmand  investigation found that the officers had conducted field training according to standard procedure, they were advised to request representation from the Department of  Justice.

The Litigation Division continued to defend against a wide range of lawsuits challenging Army decisions, programs, and activities. By the end ofFY 1997, under Au Dong Quy,  eta!., v. United States, 281 Vietnamese nationals  began  receiving payment on their claims to  recover  lost wages from clandestine operations they  conducted during the Vietnam War.  In a  continuing  lawsuit,  C.  S. McCrossan  Construction Co. Inc. v. Cook, et al., the plaintiff claimed  that  the  Small  Business Administration 8(a) program violated his equal protection rights. In  June  1997, an order was issued  declining  to  dismiss  the  suit.  As  a  result  of Stenson v. Tose, in which the Department of  Justice denied representation to a contract doctor accused  by  the  plaintiff of conducting  a  degrading  and  improper exam

at a military entrance processing station (MEPS), physicians at 14 of the 63  MEPS refused to conduct preinduction physical exams. To rectify the situation in which these doctors were viewed as independent contractors, the FY  1998 National Defense Authorization Act defined them as federal employees entitled to  medical  malpractice  immunity.  Under Whitely,  et al. v. United States, an award of $1.2 million was made to  the estate of  a British Army member who died  in  a  traffic  accident in Georgia while in a  van  driven  by  an  active  duty U.S. Army soldier,  although  the  decision has been appealed. In Vallier,  et al. v. Jet Propulsion Lab, et al., plaintifTs alleged that toxic substances released by Laboratory facilities over the past fifty years caused injuries. The Army  has assumed the lead in  litigating a third-party complaint filed by the laboratory against the United States, for whom the laboratory operated exclusively.

A number of military personnel litigation cases also continued or began during  FY  1997.  One  of the  most celebrated  cases  was Cammer  meyer v. Perry, in  which  Col.  Margaret Cammermeyer,  who was  involuntarily separated  from  the Army  National  Guard  (ARNG)  on  the  basis  of her admission that she was a  lesbian, claimed that the  homosexual  exclusion policy of  the military, in place before 1994, deprived her of  equal protection and violated her rights to privacy and free speech. On the basis of  a ruling that the homosexual exclusion policy was unconstitutional, Cammermeyer was  reinstated  in  ARNG;  the  government filed  an  appeal  in  September 1995.  The  Army  believed  that Meinhold v. Department  of Defense, a s imilar case involving a Navy officer,  would  vacate the decision that the homosexual  exclusion  was  unconstitutional.  Cammermeyer  voluntarily retired  in  March  1996, however,  and  a  court  held  in  October  1996  that the  question of constitutionality  was  moot since  the Army  had  already eliminated the homosexual exclusion policy.

Able v. United States,  et al. was filed, challenging the constitutionality of the new homosexual policy,  known as "don't  ask, don't tell, and don't pursue," on behalf  of  six plaintiff.&lt;&gt;, three of  whom were members ofUSAR orARNG. Following a ruling in  March 1995 by a district  court  that the policy was unconstitutional with respect to the First and Fifth Amendments, the government appealed the ruling. The court  reversed and vacated the decision with respect to the First  Amendment in July 1996 and remanded the case to the district court to consider the constitutionality of  the prohibition against engaging in homosexual acts. On 2 July  1997 the  district court ruled that the  policy  violated  equal  protection. The government's appeal remained pending at the end ofFY 1997. Under Holmes v. Cal(fornia Army National Guard, a  former  lieutenant claimed  in February  1995  that his  discharge under the new homosexual policy was unconstitutional. The district court held in  March  1996 that the policy violated equal protection and the First Amendment and directed reinstatement of  Holmes. In September 1997 the

government's  appeal was resolved in a decision that upheld the validity of the new policy.

In Holley v. United States, lst Lt. John Holley, a probationary officer, claimed that his discharge for incidents of  misconduct was invalid without a  hearing. The  U.S.  Court  of Federal  Claims  agreed  and  ordered  him reinctated.  The  government appealed  the  decision,  concerned  about  the impact on aU  eli. minations without  hearings of probationary officers and enlisted  soldiers  with  Jess  tha n  six  years.  On 19  September  1997,  the U.S.  Court of  Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Holley had been properly discharged. In August  I  996, Schi!&gt;m,  et.  al. v. The  United States of  America was filed  to  require the military to provide free medical care to retirees at military medical facilities. The case remained pending at the end of  FY  1997. In Christian,  et. al. v. United States, the plaintiff filed  a class action lawsuit on behalf  of  all Army competitive category lieutenant colonels who were selected for early retirement by the FY 1992 Selective Early Retirement Board, maintaining that the procedure was invalid. Oral argument on the case will begin  in October 1997.

The  major  issue  in  FY  1997  in  civilian  personnel  litigation  was sexual harassment.  In Murphy  et  at. v. West, female  employees  of the Army  Research  Laboratory  in Adelphi,  Maryland,  fi led  a  class  action lawsuit  alleging  numerous  instances  of sexual  harassment  by  a  senior› level  manager and  gender  discrimination  in  employment opportunities. The  lawsuit  was  dismissed  because  of the  plaintiffs' failure  to  exhaust administrative solutions.  Another class action lawsuit, Soto et at. v. West, alleged  sexual  harassment  and  discrimination  by  thirteen  p laintiffs  on behalf of 1,000 women who had  worked  at Fort Bliss, Texas. The Army defeated  the  class  action  lawsuit,  and  the  court dism issed  the  personal claims of twelve  plaintiffs. The thirteenth  plaintiff's claim  was  pending decision at the end of  the fiscal year.

The Army Procurement Fraud Division resolved 414 cases during FY 1997, with  1,060 cases remaining open at the  end of the fiscal  year,  and recovered $27.7 million, vvhich was significantly less than in previous years. The trend of fewer  indictments ~mel convictions was  due to  an increased emphasis  by  the  Department of Justice on health  care fraud  rather than procurement fraud.  In  the  most  important case of FY  1997,  fifty  firms and  individuals  were  found  to  be  participants  in  a  nationwide  surety fraud  scheme in  which  worthless  bid,  performance, and payment bonds were offered  as surety  in  numerous USACE and other federal contracts. Millions of dollars  in  losses and excess procurement costs were avoided, and all of the fi rms and  individuals involved  in the scheme were debarred from working with the Army.

The Army Claims Service compensates  parties  injured  by  all  DOD civilian activities, all  DOD operations in  26 foreign countries, and Army

activities  and  operations.  Knowing  that  they  will  be  compensated  for damages,  other  nations  are  more  willing  to  allow  U.S.  deployment  of forces on their soil. In  FY  1997 the Army Claims Service and field offices settled  over  66,777  claims  for  a total  of  $81.5  million, of which  60,294 were claims for property damage valued at $42.3 million  and  6,483 were personal  injury claims valued at $39.2 million. The Army Claims Service generated about $3 1.5 million by recovering $17.8 million from  property carriers  and  $ 13.7  million  from third  parties  responsible  for  medical injuries or property damage to soldiers. The Claims Service will soon begin compensating European countries for 50 years of  environmental pollution by U.S.  forces at 630 closed military sites, at a cost of  $800 million to  be paid between FYs 2000 and 2005.

In  FY  1997  the  Office  of the  Chief of Legislative  Liaison  (OCLL) engaged  in  a  variety  of activities  involving  Congress.  OCLL  arranged numerous  trips  to  Army  installations for  congressional  staff members  to talk  with  soldiers,  commanders,  and  family  members  on  readiness  and quality  of life.  In  particular,  OCLL  coordinated  extensively  to  ensure that  congressional  members  and  their  staffs  would  attend  the  advanced warfighting experiment at  Fort Irwin,  California,  in  March  1 997.  OCLL also remained closely involved with congressional members and their staffs in responding to issues resulting from the Quadrennial Defense Review. The sexual harassment issues that began to arise in November 1996 required an intensive effort by OCLL to provide information to congressional members and the public. In addition, OCLL provided liaison support to the secretary of the  Army's Senior Review  Panel on  Sexual  Harassment.  OCLL  also worked  closely  with  Congress,  particularly  the  Senate  Veterans'  Affairs Committee, on  issues pertaining to  Gulf War illness. Continued operation of  the School of  the Americas at Fort Benning became a controversial issue, but  OCLL  input  helped  to  ensure  that  congressional  funding  continued. OCU:s  Field  Operating  Agency,  the  Congressional  Inquiry  Division, responded to 31,041  letters and more than I  00,000 telephonic requests from congressional members on behalf  of  their constituents concerning military records, awards, financial  matters,  personnel issues, and assignments. The division also notified Congress of789 contracts worth more than $5 million each that had  been awarded by the Army.

## Inspector General Activities

The  miSSIOn  of The  Inspector  General  (TIG)  and  the  U.S.  Army Inspector  General  Agency  is  to inquire  into the state  of  discipline, efficiency, economy, morale, training, and readiness throughout the Army. During  FY  I  997  the Assistance  Division  of TIG 's office  handled  2,383 Inspector General action  requests (I  GAR),  of which  I  ,276  were requests

for  assistance  and  1,107  were  allegations. The  IGARs  were  submitted by  military  members  (39  percent),  unlmown  sources  (35  percent),  and civilians (26 percent). The largest percentage of the IGARs (31  percent) was concerned with personal conduct, such as sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and nonsupport of family. Nineteen percent of  the I  GARs involved command or management of  organizations, which included caring for soldiers and family members, storage and shipment of property, and exercising  command  influence. Military  personnel management issues such as recruiting,  reassignments, evaluation reports, promotions, separations, and awards and decorations composed 14  percent of the requests. Eight percent of  the I  GARs were concerned with civilian personnel management, including  management and employee  relations,  recruitment,  placement, promotions, and awards. Health care issues, which encompassed in- and out-patient  care,  medical  records,  veterans' health  care,  and  medical evaluation boards, composed 4 percent of the I  GARs. Another 4 percent involved acquisition  issues,  including policies  and  procedures,  contract administration, contract surveillance, and competition. Of  the total I  GARs, 100 were DOD whistleblower cases. The White House referred 64 requests to the Inspector General,  130 to Congress, and 85 to senior Army or DOD leaders. There were also 538 DOD Hotline requests. The Investigations Division in TIG's  office received 648 allegations against general officers, senior executive  service civilian employees, and  other officials  in high› visibility  positions.  Of the  thirty-seven  formal  investigations  completed, approximately 8 percent were substantiated, with abuse of  authority as the most frequent allegation.

## Conclusion

## The Army s• Principal  Achievements and Problems

The  international security  environment presented  numerous  diverse threats  to  the  United  States  during  FY  1997.  A  number  of countries possessed the means and desire to threaten U.S. vital interests, and many persisted in  improving their offensive capabilities. Some nations pursued the development or acquisition of  nuclear, biological, or  chemical weapons. In  various  parts  of the  world,  destabilization  became  a  clear  threat  as governments  failed, nations lost  stability, or  internal  conflicts  arose. United States interests and individual citizens were particularly threatened by transnational problems, such as terrorism, the illegal drug trade, illegal arms  trafficking,  international  organized crime,  uncontrolled  migrations of displaced  persons,  and  environmental  damage. With  recent advances in  technology,  some of these  threats  have  increased  in importance. The greatest potential threat to the United States and global security, however, remained  the  possession  or  potential  possession  of weapons  of mass destruction (WMD)  by  terrorists,  international crime organizations,  and hostile governments or their representatives.

The  United States was coming to  terms  with the  new international security environment in FY 1997. Thousands of U.S. soldiers rotated  in and out ofBosnia on primarily six-month tours, serving in  an area in which peacekeeping skills,  rather than  warfighting skills associated  with  high intensity  conflict,  were  of paramount importance. Their responsibilities included monitoring and controlling warring factions, providing security, coordinating  international  relief  and  reconstitution,  aiding  displaced persons to return to their country, and restoring or  establishing government institutions. The Army had  been reluctant in  the early  1990s to  conduct numerous  peacekeeping  or humanitarian  operations  but  had  gradually come  to  accept  that  the  threat had  changed.  Instead  of the  behemoth, superpower Soviet Union,  a  disparate group of smaller states scattered throughout  the  world  in  various  hot  spots  became  the  primary  focus. Army  leaders and soldiers  began to  recognize that not only  could  they contribute  to  world  security  through  such  operations,  they  could  also

hone  individual  and  unit  skills  in  live  operations.  Joint  and  combined operations  have  become commonplace as U.S.  soldiers serve  in  Bosnia as  part of the  Multinational Division (North). During the Cold War, only those soldiers  who were stationed  in Germany participated  in  RGrOR GER (Return of Forces to Germany). Those who were stationed in  the Pacific region  had a consistent opportunity to work with military personnel from other nations.

At  the  end  of the  fiscal year,  32,000  Total  Army  soldiers  were deployed  to  70  countries.  Between  9,000  and  11,000  troops  supported Operation JOINT  GuARD  at any  one time  in  Bosnia, Croatia, or Hungary during FY J 997. The Army also participated in the United Nations (UN) Preventive  Deployment  peacekeeping  mission  in  the  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Task  Force ABLE  SENTRY,  an  infantry, cavalry, or  armor  battalion  task  force,  conducted  border  patrols  in  six-month rotations. Total Army soldiers  participated  in other UN  missions around the  world,  most  notably  the  Military  Observer  Mission  Ecuador  and Peru, under the auspices of  Joint Task Force (JTF) SArB  BoRDER;  the UN Military  Observation  Group  in  Monrovia,  Liberia;  the  UN  Mission  in Guatemala; the UN Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem; and the UN Mission for the Referendum in the Western Sahara. In addition, U.S. soldiers served  with  the  non-UN  Multinational  Force  and  Observers  in the Sinai. Through Operation SusTAIN Lmmnv, military police companies rotated  into Panama to serve for six months protecting U.S.  installations. Army personnel participated in  numerous other peacekeeping operations in  Honduras, El Salvador, and Brazil. Through various operations in the U.S.  Central Command region, such as DESERT Focus, YIGILANTTIIUNDER, NoRTHERN WATCII, and SouTHERN  WATCH,  Army  soldiers  assisted  in protecting U.S. forces and preventing Iraqi retaliatory strikes. Government instability  required  the  Army's assistance  in  conducting  noncombatant evacuation operations from Sierra Leone, the Congo, and Albania. Soldiers also helped evacuate 6,000 Kurdish displaced persons from  Guam to the United States in JTF PACIFIC HAVEN.  During any given week, an average of 4,690 Special Operations Forces personnel were deployed to 69 countries in  support of  303 missions.

Within the United States, Army soldiers supported drug law enforcement agencies (OLEA) in the counterdrug program and supported counterterrorism efforts. More than 4,000 troops were assigned on a daily basis  to  assist  civilian  DLEAs as  well  as  major  commands,  and  Army aircraft  flew  46,000  hours  on  behalf of the  counterdrug  program.  The Army primarily provided intelligence, linguist, aviation, or Special Forces personnel, in addition to specialized equipment. All Army reconnaissance, surveillance, and monitoring support was suspended in July 1997, however, when  a U.S.  marine shot a civilian  in  a counterclrug operation.  In  a new

initiative to combat terrorist incidents involving WMD, the Army created a Domestic Preparedness Section and provided personnel to evaluate the programs and train the first response teams of  major cities throughout the United States.

The most significant training program during the fiscal year was the advanced  warfighting  experiment  (AWE)  at Fort  Irwin,  California,  in March 1997. The selection of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) as the  experimental  force  (EXFOR)  allowed  for  the  fielding  of thousands of pieces of new equipment and systems to the unit at Fort Hood, Texas, before  the experiment. Months  of training,  practice, and field  exercises culminated in the month-long experiment at the National Training Center at  Fort Irwin,  where  the Army  collected  voluminous  amounts  of data that it is currently analyzing. New technologies took center stage in the experiment, particularly those of computer, intelligence, simulation, and information  systems,  creating  the  first  complete,  real-time  situational awareness of  the battlefield that will help to eliminate friendly fire and the fog of  war in  the future. Through the AWE,  the Army has also expedited new product development and  acquisition.  It identified eleven  weapons systems  that  Congress  then  agreed  to  fund for  immediate  fielding, bypassing the  traditionally  long process for  incorporating  new  systems into  the inventory. By using the EXFOR and examining its performance in  the  experiment, the Army  will  be able  to  restructure  its  divisions  for the  twenty-first century. The Army  has  been  conducting Division XXl, another AWE,  since March  1997 to finalize the architecture for  the first digitized division.

Despite its successes, the Army encountered a  number of problems during the year. Sexual harassment  and misconduct  were primary concerns. National publicity focused on the allegations against the Sergeant Major oftheArmy; tlw drill instructors at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; and numerous other drill instructors and soldiers in various other locations. Although  the  Army  recognized  that  a  problem  existed  and  took  steps to  eradicate  behavior and  attitudes  that  it  deemed  unacceptable,  these public  charges  and  their  subsequent  investigations  rocked  the  Army's belief that its soldiers adhered  to traditional Army values.  By instituting Character Development XXI, the Army hoped to  instill in new recruits the  basic  values  of honor,  courage,  respect,  integrity,  loyalty,  duty,  and selfless service,  particularly respect towards  others.  Moreover,  although the  number of sexual harassment complaints in FY  1997  declined,  the number  that  was  substantiated  increased,  perhaps  indicating  that  the Army's longstanding previous behavior of  discounting sexual harassment claims  had  been  transformed  into accepting their  possible validity and then conducting appropriate investigations.

## Army Posture

Retaining technological  superiority in the future  Army remains imperative.  The  Army  has  been forced to  rely on recapitalization  of equipment  to  bring  aging  equipment  to  modern  standards  and,  in  FY 1997, set a goal  or recapitalizing 75  percent  of all  equipment  by  2012. Although recent budgets have not permitted sufficient modernization, the Army  budget will  begin  to  provide increased funds  for modernization  in FY 1999 for the 'Orst time since  1 985. With an  eye towards the future, the Army plans to concentrate  its efforts on sustaining a combat capabilities overmatch in the ncar term, funding research and development through FY 2003  to support the Army After Next.  Old systems that  are expensive to maintain will be reti red, and technology will be inserted into other systems to  extend  their  useful lives.  During  the  midterm  years,  from  FY  2004 through FY 20 I  0, the Army will continue these programs and concentrate on  information  dominance,  which it expects  to achieve  by  2010.  In  the long term, from FY 2011  to FY 2020, the Army will invest in  new science and technology research and  products to maintain battlefield dominance.

One of  the Army's key priorities will always be its military readiness. Surprisingly,  despite  the  emphasis  on Operation  JorNT GuARD, other operations,  and  the AWE,  the  fully-mission-capable  rate  of the  Army' s sixteen major-weapons systems dramatically improved Ji·om FY 2096. ln that year,  the M  I  A2 Abrams tank, the 11cavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck transporter, the AH- 64 helicopter, the CH-47D helicopter, and  the Ul I - 60 helicopter had  not met the Army's readiness goals. Moreover, the M I  A2,  the AH- 64,  and  the  UH- 60  had  been  significantly  below  their fully-mission-capable readiness goals.  By the end of FY 2097, each of  the sixteen major-weapons systems had met or exceeded its  readiness goal.

The  Army  participated  in  or  conducted  numerous  exercises  that tested equipment,  personnel,  doctrine, organization, and operational skills, both within  the United States and overseas. Through its partnership exercises, the Army provided a valuable contribution towards maintaining or attaining international security. Most nations around the world have  as  their  major  military  force  an  army;  and  army-to-army  contacts have  become  increasingly  important  as  a  means  to  develop  goodwil l, fr iendship, and  binding ties  between other nations and  the  United  States. Moreover, both  large-scale  and  smaller,  unit exercises  have  enabled the U.S. Army and  foreign armies to learn  how to work together in  peacetime in  the eventuality  that a crisis or contingency demands such  a combined venture in the future.  While conducting such training, Army soldiers have also  contributed  towards  nation  building  in  lesser  developed  countries, conducting medical or engineer missions that vastly improve the health or lives of  the  local  popu lace.

Although  the  Army  has  nearly reached  its personnel levels as recommended  by  the  1993  Bottom-Up Review (BUR), the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) completed in  1997  resulted  in  another series of personnel cuts that began in FY 1997 and will continue through FY 2006, eliminating 93,700  service members  and  civilians from  the Army.  This will  result in an  additional  decrease of  7  percent over the  next ten  years in  an Army that has already been decimated by personnel reductions and is  at its smallest size since the end of World  War II. The proliferation of peacekeeping and  humanitarian operations that Army soldiers have  been asked  to  conduct has  affected  negatively  their quality  of life,  requiring the  average  soldier  to  be  away  from  his  home  station  and  his  family for  extended  periods each year. The Army  is  attempting to  decrease the personnel tempo for active duty soldiers, who sometimes serve on repeat tours  around the  globe,  by incorporating U.S.  Army Reserve and Army National Guard personnel into operations whenever possible.

Quality of life  has gained in  importance with each  year that the size of the Army  has  decreased. To  retain quality soldiers,  the Army  knows that it must provide a semblance of  the life that soldiers and their families could  obtain  in  the  civilian  world.  Under  the  Whole  Barracks  Renewal Program and the Barracks Upgrade Program, increased funding did permit for the construction, upgrade, and modernization of  barracks that provided accommodations  for  many  single  soldiers  of a  quality  equal  to  that  of married soldiers. By 2012, the Army intends to  have replaced completely all of its  barracks spaces so  that each soldier has a private room, a stark contrast  to  conditions  before  the  beginning  of  the  Whole  Barracks Renewal  Program  in  1992,  when  three  or  four  enlisted  soldiers  were crammed  into small, dingy rooms with dilapidated furniture  and  forced to  use  community  showers  and  toilets.  Additionally,  the  state of family housing also improved as the Army turned to privatization to revitalize and replace units for married service members and their fam ilies. Despite the Army's best efforts, however, most accommodations available for service members range from extremely old to ancient.
