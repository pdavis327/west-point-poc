## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1999

## 1 Introduction

The Army was emerging from a decade of reorganization and doctrinal change as it entered the 1990s. By the late 1970s, the All-Volunteer Army was displaying persistent problems, causing Army Chief of Staff General Edward C. Meyer to call it a 'hollow force' in his May 1980 testimony before  the  House Armed  Services  Committee. Army  leaders  faced  the grim reality  that  half  of  all  new  enlisted  personnel  either  scored  in  the lowest acceptable category of the Armed Forces Qualification Test or had failed to complete high school, and were entering a force characterized by poor morale and severely limited resources. From that low point, Army leaders resurrected the force during the 1980s as the restructured Army of Excellence, honing the AirLand Battle doctrine of maneuver warfare espoused in the 1982 Field Manual (FM) 100-5, Operations , and procuring a substantial array of new hardware to replace aging equipment. Rigorous attention  to  recruiting,  training,  and  retaining  high-quality  personnel, combined  with  significantly  increased  defense  spending,  enabled  the Army to become a far more formidable force. By the end of the 1980s, the Army was clearly capable of meeting the threat posed by the Soviet Union's conventional forces and fulfilling the other requirements of the National Military Strategy.In the decade between fiscal year (FY) 1989 and FY 1999, the maturation and fiscal adaptation of the reform policies of the 1980s continued and were tried by fire as a new international order emerged following the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and collapse of the Soviet Union. The sudden end of the Cold War and the appearance of new regional and global threats during the 1990s presented the Army with substantial challenges, even as the success of recent reforms offered a  model  for  the  adaptations  required  to  meet  them.  While  diplomats, politicians, and economists explored the ramifications of the developing post-Cold War international order, the United States  Army began preparing to enter the twenty-first century. By the decade' s end in FY 1999, the Army had designed two new force structures, Force XXI and Army After Next (AAN), as successors to the Army of Excellence architecture, and it had initiated the programs required to create those organizations.

In  June  1990,  Secretary  of  Defense  Richard  B.  Cheney  reluctantly submitted a plan to Congress that outlined a 25 percent decrease in the size of the armed services. The plan, a response to growing budget deficits and the rapidly diminishing threat posed by the Warsaw Pact, called for the reduction of the active Army from eighteen divisions to a base force of fourteen divisions by 1995. The base force design abandoned the largescale  forward  positioning  of  the  Cold War  in  favor  of  domestic  basing and enhanced force-projection capabilities, enabling a flexible and timely response to crises around the globe while reducing military expenditures. President  George  Bush  announced  his  support  of  this  plan,  the  first structural adaptation of the armed services to the approaching end of the Cold War era, on 2 August 1990.

Iraq  launched  a  successful  invasion  of  Kuwait  that  same  day.  The Army  soon  responded  to  that  aggression  by  deploying  to  Saudi Arabia in conjunction with a multinational coalition. As it entered FY 1991, the Army that was created during the Cold War to defeat the Warsaw Pact in the complex terrain of Europe prepared for battle against an adversary using Soviet-style weapons and tactics in open country that resembled its own training facilities at Fort Irwin, California. Operations Desert shielD and the Desert storm offensive that followed revealed both the success of the previous decade' s reforms and the weaknesses remaining in the force they produced. American soldiers  smashed  the  Iraqi  army  in  a  hundred-hour ground campaign, following weeks of preparatory air strikes that capitalized on improved guided munitions and unchallenged aerial supremacy. But the forces supporting the Gulf War effort, previously identified by Secretary Cheney as straining U.S. financial resources in time of peace, took months to  prepare  and  deploy  for  combat.  Their  one-sided  victory  owed  much to the availability of secure staging areas and Iraq' s failure to mount any substantial diplomatic or military opposition to the required buildup. Few military planners would be optimistic enough to depend on a repetition of those auspicious circumstances in future contingency operations.

But  before  FY  1991  ended,  the  Gulf War  had  become  the  obvious model for large-scale conflicts in the foreseeable future. On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact recognized the reality of its collapse by officially disbanding. The  failure  of  an  August  coup  attempt  by  hard-line  Communist  party leaders  in  Moscow,  and  the  prominent  role  of  Russian  President  Boris Yeltsin in its suppression, underscored the deterioration of Washington' s Cold War rival. On 25 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, replaced that day when eleven of the twelve remaining Soviet republics joined the Commonwealth of Independent States established by Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus on 8 December. The bipolar world that had emerged in 1945 disappeared, taking with it the superficial stability long imposed by superpower rivalry.

In the absence of the restraint enforced by superpower patronage and the threat of global escalation, regional conflicts like the Gulf War could only become more likely. In the eyes of American strategists, the rapidly approaching twenty-first century would be characterized by the threat of such conflicts, the need for peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, and counterterrorist operations, rather than preparations for total war in Western Europe. The Army of the Cold War era, effective as it was in Operation Desert storm, was not optimized for those tasks.

The truth of that bleak forecast was demonstrated in FY 1992, even as  Army  planners  evaluated  the  lessons  of  the  Gulf  War.  Within  the Commonwealth  of  Independent  States,  newly  established  governments struggled  over  boundaries  and  the  renewal  of  ancient  cultural  and political  rivalries.  Afghanistan  erupted  into  another  round  of  internal turmoil. Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia all seceded from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, leading the United Nations (UN) to support the use of force to end Bosnian bombardment of Sarajevo. Iraq obstructed UN weapons inspections mandated by the Gulf War peace accords. The Army needed to adapt to this new strategic environment.

Although  the  National  Military  Strategy  released  in  January  1992 indicated the direction American leaders had chosen in light of the new reality, the base force concept supported by President Bush amounted to a modest reduction in size rather than a major realignment of the Department of  Defense  (DOD).  In  March  1993,  the  incoming  administration  of President William  J.  Clinton  initiated  a  thorough  review  of  the  armed services  and  American  strategy  from  the  bottom  up  to  guide  a  more comprehensive response.

Secretary of Defense Les Aspin released the Report on the BottomUp Review in October 1993. The results of the seven-month investigation shaped defense planning and Army policy through FY 1999, preparing the armed  services  for  the  challenges  of  the  twenty-first  century. Establishing the ability to face two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts as the measure of acceptable military capability, the review identified five primary threats to U.S. security in the post-Cold War era. Those threats were  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction;  regional  crises caused  by  the  aggression  of  a  major  regional  power;  conflicts  arising out  of  religious  or  ethnic  animosities,  subversion,  or  state-sponsored terrorism; dangers to democracy and reform in the former Warsaw Pact nations  or  elsewhere;  and  potential  dangers  to  the  United  States  from domestic economic failure.

As  the Army  examined  the  implications  of  the  review  in  early  FY 1994,  it  continued  to  execute  the  force  and  budget  reductions  initiated in  the  late  1980s.  The  Army' s  Total  Obligation  Authority  dropped  36 percent between FY 1989 and FY 1994, despite a 300 percent increase in

operational deployments since the end of the Cold War. In an attempt to preserve crucial modernization programs such as the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter  and  the  Crusader  artillery  system,  the  Army  had  already accelerated previously planned personnel reductions.

Those  reductions  continued  under  the  guidance  provided  by  the Report on the Bottom-Up Review. The document called for a decrease to ten active and 'five plus' reserve component divisions by FY 1999, with a total reserve component strength of 575,000 by that year. Increased prepositioning of supplies and improved battlefield mobility would enable the reduced Army to deliver decisive fire power earlier than had the Army of the Gulf War, despite a continued decline in forward stationing.

The  review  recognized  the  existence  of  an  ongoing  revolution in warfare driven by information technology and other recent developments, which in turn suggested the creation of new operational and tactical concepts to exploit the emerging capabilities. Among Army systems specifically mentioned as exemplars of what came to be called the  'Revolution  in  Military  Affairs'  were  those  associated  with  the development of ballistic missile defense, along with the AH-64 Apache Longbow attack helicopter, the advanced fire-and-forget version of the Hellfire missile it would carry, and the RAH-66 Comanche armed scout helicopter.  Such  systems  used  their  ability  to  rapidly  collect,  process, and respond to information to maximize the impact of relatively minor destructive  power  across  all  levels  of  warfare.  An  overhaul  of  the procurement system and the introduction of commercial practices and technologies from the civilian world would, it was hoped, reduce the time requirements and costs of those new systems and extend the promise of the revolution into Army administration. Like the rest of the DOD, the Army would place renewed emphasis on quality-of-life issues under the recommendations of the Report on the Bottom-Up Review to attract and retain the high-quality personnel the armed services required to pursue this technological revolution.

The National Military Strategies of FY 1995 and FY 1997 built upon the foundation of the Bottom-Up Review and the Army's response to it. As FY 1994 unfolded, the Army Staff began developing plans for an informationage Army structure called Force XXI. The belief that information would be almost as important as ammunition in future conflicts dictated the shape of Force XXI. To achieve victory, the futuristic force would overwhelm its enemies by integrating information technology and weapons systems in a process called force digitization. Force XXI would use that integration to  establish  a  common  awareness  of  the  situation,  coordinate  activities throughout the zone of combat in real time, accelerate the pace of battle, and  optimize  the  Army' s  responsiveness.  As  the  Army  adopted  this structure and the concomitant technologies and doctrine, it would begin to

operate as an increasingly cohesive system-of-systems, capitalizing on its full range of capabilities.

Force XXI originated in the AirLand Battle doctrine of FM 100-5 as it  was  reinterpreted  in  1993  and  further  developed  in  the August  1994 release of Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Pamphlet 525-5, Force XXI Operations: A Concept for the Evolution of Full-Dimensional Operations for the Strategic Army of the Early Twenty-First Century. Five characteristics defined Force XXI: doctrinal flexibility; strategic mobility; tailorability and modularity; joint, multinational, and interagency connectivity; and versatility in war and in operations other than war. Those characteristics corresponded well with the design for early twenty-firstcentury military capabilities that the Joint Chiefs of Staff announced with the 1995 publication of Joint Vision 2010.

As described by the TRADOC, Force XXI doctrine was developed for a force-projection army consistent with the base force concept rather than the forward-deployed formations of the Cold War. The new doctrine addressed the challenges of the emerging multipolar world and the lessons of recent  combat  experiences.  It  employed  innovative  technological capabilities, both enhancements to existing equipment and evolving new platforms, to replace the sequential operations of earlier Army doctrine with  a  system  of  simultaneous  operations.  The  force  would  support  a digital, knowledge-based mode of land warfare in the first two decades of the twenty-first century.

As  Army planners spent the mid-1990s establishing the precise doctrine and programs needed to make Force XXI a reality, they also began planning for its successor. The potential of the revolution in military affairs could not be fully exploited in the short-term plans for Force XXI, nor could the existing Army sacrifice mission readiness to hasten more ambitious reforms and the technological innovations they required. Modernization would necessarily be a gradual and deliberate process. The legacy force, the existing Army of the early 1990s, would be supported and maintained as  information  systems  and  new  techniques  transformed  its  weapons platforms and policies into those of the interim force, Force XXI. At the same time, research and development efforts would begin preparing the Army to leap ahead to the objective force, AAN, around the year 2025.

The concepts for such a force began emerging in 1993, partly as a byproduct of early discussions over Force XXI. General Dennis J. Reimer, the Army chief of staff, asked the TRADOC to start officially exploring possibilities for the Army of 2025 during FY 1994. By February 1996, those explorations had matured into a formal structure, TRADOC' s Army After Next Project. Discussions continued through FY 1999, focusing on the geostrategic setting, state of the military art, human and organizational issues, and technological trends that might influence the army of 2025. The

emerging consensus depicted AAN as a network-driven force maximizing the potential of Force XXI' s system-of-systems approach to warfare, adding physical speed and agility to the mental agility developed by Force XXI. Lightweight, survivable, sustainable, and lethal systems would combine their specialized functions in real time to dominate the battlespace through precision and information dominance.

That objective force, successor to the current legacy force and the rapidly emerging interim Force XXI, was shaped by a series of war games in the late 1990s. The Leavenworth Games, force-on-force exercises conducted by the TRADOC Analysis Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, explored the demands of warfare in the world of 2025. A series of Winter War Games conducted at Carlisle  Barracks,  Pennsylvania,  served  as  the  capstone  of those joint exercises. Both the war games and the discussions surrounding them drew on expertise from academia, industry, the armed services, and other government agencies to help the Army prepare for the future.

By the end of FY 1998, the Army had initiated a number of programs intended to make Force XXI and its successor, AAN, operational realities. Those efforts extended beyond the research, development, and procurement of  new  technologies.  Recruiting,  training,  and  retaining  high-quality personnel  were  as  essential  to  the  ongoing  modernization  campaign  as they had been to the restoration of the Army in the early 1980s. Efforts to provide an improved quality of life for military families, including housing and military construction, educational and recreational opportunities, and expanded  use  of  reserve  component  personnel  to  reduce  the  frequency of  individual  deployments,  helped  the  Army  maintain  its  appeal  in  a highly competitive labor market. While making these efforts, the Army implemented the force and budget reductions established in the Report on the Bottom-Up Review and maintained a high operational tempo.

The global instability that began to emerge as the Warsaw Pact withered away  and  the  Soviet  Union  collapsed  from  within,  and  the  subsequent increase in U.S. contingency operations, continued through the 1990s as the Army pursued its reform agenda. Unrest in the Balkans led to U.S. intervention  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina  and  Kosovo,  while  humanitarian crises required American responses in Somalia and Haiti. Iraq' s stubborn refusal to comply with the provisions of the Gulf War cease-fire agreement produced  a  standing  U.S.  commitment  to  enforce  no-fly  zones  in  the northern and southern regions of that nation, and the threat of renewed hostilities required an expanded military presence throughout the region. Smaller crises, the growth of international terrorism, drug interdiction, and other demands, combined with the Army's mission of shaping a stable and secure international order, strained the Army' s ability to respond without penalizing readiness or training.

Balancing  operational  readiness  and  training  requirements  with  the

demands of force modernization was one of several challenges awaiting the Army as it entered the final fiscal year of the decade. Approaching FY 1999, the Army displayed clear signs that it had not been entirely successful in striking that balance recently. Training shortfalls, maintenance backlogs, aging equipment and infrastructure, and continued shortages in important personnel categories had to be addressed within the constraints of a budget essentially unchanged from FY 1998.

In addition, the year marked the end of both the first post-Cold War decade  and  the  guidance  originally  provided  by  the  bottom-up  review process that sought to prepare the Army for the twenty-first century. As the Army continued to pursue the plans for Force XXI and AAN it had developed in response to the review, it would need to establish a revised and  extended  equivalent  to  the  review' s  guidance  to  meet  the  demands of the next decade. The Army's strength of ten active and eight reservecomponent divisions at the end of FY 1998 already reflected an adaptation of  the  goal  of  ten  active  and  five-plus  reserve-component  divisions originally established by the review for FY 1999.

The  Army's  commitments  on  the  first  day  of  FY  1999  were  extensive  even for an eighteen-division force. In Germany and Korea, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, Kuwait and Turkey, and in less prominent locations around the  globe,  the  Army  continued  to  shape  the  international  environment and protect U.S. interests. Manning those deployed and forward-stationed units, and meeting the personnel and logistics requirements of the Army as a whole would strain operational tempo guidelines and challenge the Army's  personnel  and  logistical  systems.  Continued  implementation  of improved  business  practices  and  other  initiatives  launched  during  the 1990s as part of the overall revolution in military affairs offered the Army a  means  of  increasing  its  effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  meeting  those challenges during FY 1999.

As  the  final  fiscal  year  of  both  a  decade  and  a  century,    FY  1999 presented the Army with several unique challenges in preparation for the year  2000.  On  31  December  1999,  the  United  States  was  scheduled  to withdraw from Panama and to turn over all of its remaining property in that nation. The Army, therefore, had to withdraw its forces from Panama and make final preparations for the transition during FY 1999. After almost a century of continuous American presence, this represented a difficult, and at times emotional, transition for all those concerned. Headquarters, U.S. Army South, faced the challenge of directing the process in Panama even as it relocated from that nation to Puerto Rico.

Army computer systems, like many others, faced an even more unusual challenge  with  the  approach  of  the  year  2000. That  date  represented  a potential threat to the continued functioning and reliability of information systems still using only two digits to represent the year in date calculations.

Despite several years of effort, as of October 1998 only half of the Army' s systems reported readiness for the inescapable arrival of 1 January 2000. During FY 1999, the Army had to prepare the remaining systems, confirm their  networked  functions,  and  validate  contingency  plans  for  potential problems in both military and civilian information systems.

Those  preparations  and  contingency  plans  corresponded  with  two elements  of  the  Army' s  mission  as  identified  in  the  National  Military Strategy: responding to the full spectrum of crises abroad and at home, and  preparing  for  an  uncertain  future.  In  planning  for  the  transition  to 2000 and examining potential responses to local disturbances caused by related  computer  failures,  the Army  also  increased  its  preparedness  for acts of cyber warfare and domestic terrorism. The terrorist threat received considerable attention in the final days of FY 1998 and throughout FY 1999 as the Army continued to implement and coordinate new procedures for dealing with the potential use of weapons of mass destruction within the United States.

The National Domestic Preparedness Office pursued a similar goal as it entered its first full fiscal year of operation in FY 1999. Administered by the Army as the lead agency for that DOD-supported working group, the  office  underwent  several  months  of  turmoil  before  emerging  as  an interagency  office  supported  by  the  Department  of  Justice.  The  Army added a useful weapon to the arsenal of federal, state, and local programs coordinated  by  the  National  Domestic  Preparedness  Office  when  it established the first Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams. Those  reserve-component  units  became  operational  during  FY  1999, standing ready to coordinate the activities of local and federal agencies responding to a nuclear, biological, or chemical incident while providing expert assistance to first-responders.

Shaping  the  international  environment  is  the  third  in  the  National Military Strategy triad of mission elements. As it entered FY 1999, the Army had more than twenty-eight thousand soldiers deployed away from their home stations in seventy foreign nations. During the year, the Army faced ongoing operational demands in Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Persian Gulf. It continued to promote U.S. interests by training foreign militaries, supporting arms control missions, and providing humanitarian assistance where needed.

The need for that assistance was apparent from the first day of the new  fiscal  year,  as  the  northern  Caribbean  reeled  from  the  devastation caused by Hurricane Georges. The 15-29 September storm struck the U.S. mainland in Mississippi as well, leaving hundreds of thousands of people along the U.S. Gulf Coast without electricity. National Guard personnel already  deployed  to  provide  disaster  relief  and  humanitarian  assistance as FY 1999 began soon faced another natural disaster-Hurricane Mitch

caused additional  billions  of  dollars  in  damage  and  claimed  more  than ten  thousand  lives  in  the  Caribbean  basin  before  passing  over  Florida on  5  November.  Members  of  the  National  Guard,  Army  Reserve,  and active Army spent much of the year in the subsequent relief and recovery efforts.

Whereas  humanitarian missions contributed to the year' s high operational tempo, they also provided welcome opportunities to combine training  activities  and  operational  deployments.  The  relief  efforts  for Hurricanes Georges  and Mitch allowed active Army  and  reservecomponent  units  to  practice  mobilization  procedures  and  their  more specialized skills against real needs. Some reserve-component personnel used scheduled training missions to address humanitarian concerns within the United States, providing dental and veterinary care to Native American communities in Montana and Alaska.

The Army also continued to provide training assistance to foreign nations. One venue for that assistance, the School of the Americas, was a source of public controversy during FY 1999 because of continued allegations  that  its  curriculum  somehow  supported  or  encouraged human  rights  abuses. Army  efforts  to  support  foreign  and  domestic drug law enforcement agencies (DLEAs) proved to be more popular. In addition to training DLEA personnel, the active and reserve components provided  operational  support  and  equipment  in  the  struggle  against illegal drugs.

Some of that equipment became available as the Army procured more modern materiel. Research, development, testing, and evaluation efforts continued  to  improve  the  sophistication  of  Army  hardware  during  the fiscal year. Programs to develop technologies such as M1A2 Abrams tank upgrades, the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, and the Crusader artillery system consumed more than $5 billion of the Army's $64 billion FY99 appropriation. The first upgraded M1A2s entered Army service at the end of the year, and prototype trials of the Comanche and Crusader brought those weapons systems nearer to production.

Important  as  they  are  to  maintaining  the  Army' s  technological superiority, such development programs also offered less obvious benefits. The Army continued to expand the number of research grants and contracts offered  to  historically  black  colleges  and  universities  and  to  minority institutions during FY 1999, thus promoting equal access to educational and research opportunities. Procurement efforts reflected the same interest in assisting disadvantaged populations through the first use of Historically Underutilized Business Zone contracts to assist regions of high poverty or unemployment. Such research and procurement efforts introduced the Army's first 'green ammunition' during FY 1999. The environmentally friendly 5.56-mm round was expected to reduce both the amount of lead

contamination produced by Army ranges and the use of toxic substances in the manufacturing process.

Advances in environmental health, equal access, and local economies all  promote  quality  of  life,  an  issue  of  general  concern  throughout  the force in FY 1999. The quality of life offered to Army personnel is a key element in the success of recruiting and retention efforts. Those efforts were  complicated  during  the  year  by  the  competitive  labor  market  and the perceived gap between civilian and military pay, but the active Army and  National  Guard  both  met  their  end-strength  goals,  and  the  Army Reserve  missed  its  target  by  less  than  one  percent.  Efforts  to  improve Army housing, correct a growing shortage of Roman Catholic chaplains, raise pay, provide educational opportunities, and identify and correct other quality-of-life issues sought to maintain and improve the appeal of Army life during FY 1999.

In accordance with the 1997 National Military Strategy, the Army' s overall  objective  for  FY  1999  was  to  defend  and  protect  U.S.  national interests by promoting peace and stability while remaining ready to defeat adversaries  if  such  action  became  necessary.  The  Army  pursued  that objective in accordance with the guidance provided by the Report on the Bottom-Up Review, seeking to implement Force XXI reforms, maintain the readiness of the existing force, and prepare for the advent of the Army After Next. Along the way it faced budgetary constraints, continued personnel problems, and natural disasters,  but  it  proved  capable  of  meeting  those and other challenges and of executing its full mission under the National Military Strategy.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

In  March  1993,  Secretary  of  Defense  Les  Aspin  initiated  a  comprehensive review of U.S. defense strategy, force structure, modernization, infrastructure,  and  foundations  from  the  bottom  up. A  response  to  the sweeping changes in geopolitics and security threats brought on by the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Bottom-Up Review was the first step in a complete restructuring of the U.S. military. By 1994 the Army had responded to the Report on the Bottom-Up Review with the genesis of its own plan for an organization capable of meeting the demands of national security in the early twenty-first century.

The resulting force structure, Force XXI, required substantial changes in the institutional Army, information technology, and operational units. The transformed units would be easier to deploy and capable of precision engagement and dominance across the full spectrum of missions. Emerging information technologies would be exploited to maximize the efficiency, flexibility, and lethality of the new configuration.

The Army  quickly  articulated  its  goals  for  harnessing  information technology as the Army Enterprise Strategy, which mandated the creation of a seamless information environment throughout the range of command, control,  communications,  computers,  and  intelligence  (C4I)  activities. The Army Enterprise  Strategy,  as  a  component  of  Force  XXI  reforms, produced substantial changes in the institutional Army in the late 1990s. The U.S. Army Modernization Plan for 1995 and its successors provided the architecture for the Army' s transition to the new structure.

By FY 1999, the major organizational realignments and implementation of new technologies called for in the Army Enterprise Strategy and the Force XXI campaign were well under way, if not accomplished. As a result, the Army Staff introduced few substantive changes in FY 1999. The year' s organizational  activities  were  marked  by  the  continued  pursuit  of  prior initiatives rather than the creation of new ones as the Army furthered its transformation to meet the requirements of the National Military Strategy and the transition to Force XXI.

Demonstrating  the  growing  prominence  of  contingency  operations and coalitions in the post-Cold War era, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary  of  the  Army  (International  Affairs)  (ODUSA-IA)  completed its  second  full  year  of  operations  in  FY  1999.  Established  in  FY  1997, the  ODUSA-IA  develops,  coordinates,  supports,  and  assesses  Army international  activities  in  support  of  the  National  Security  Strategy,  the National  Military  Strategy,  and  the  regional  strategies  of  the  Combat Commands.

One  of ODUSA-IA's  two  directorates, the International Policy Integration and Assessment Directorate, houses the International Policy, Plans, Programs, and Integration Division (IPP). The IPP participated in restructuring The Army Plan (TAP) mission areas and revising AR 1132, Army Long-Range Planning System, during FY 1999. The revisions consolidated  ten  mission  areas  into  seven  and  established  co-chairs  for each mission-area team. The ODUSA-IA became a co-chair of the mission areas 'Promote Regional Stability' and 'Reduce Potential Conflicts and Threats,' integrating its objectives into Army strategic planning guidance. The IPP also translated the requirements for Army international activities into capabilities for inclusion in Army Planning Guidance, section two of TAP. These developments promoted the integration, through ODUSA-IA, of the Army's international programs and coalition-building efforts into strategic planning.

The potential threat of terrorist acts using weapons of mass destruction was addressed in FY 1999 through an organization that briefly fell under the Army's administrative aegis. Originally functioning as a Department of Defense (DOD) office supported by the Army, the newly created National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO) soon transferred to the Department of  Justice. The  organization,  a  working  group  focusing,  synchronizing, and  integrating  federal  support  of  domestic  response  to  weapons  of mass  destruction,  coordinated  the  activities  of  the  DOD,  the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Justice. The decision to allow the Department of Justice to lead the NDPO through its designated agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ended several months of rivalry as various constituents struggled to define the organization' s structure and role.

Army  personnel  began  implementing  a  new  system  for  managing temporary-duty travel in FY 1999. The Defense Travel System (DTS) is a DOD-directed program in which the newly established DTS-Army worked in close cooperation with the DOD Project Management Office-DTS to create  an  automated,  paperless  travel  system.  Fort  Campbell,  Kentucky, was selected as the test site for the new system, which was extended to the reserve components before the end of the fiscal year. Digitizing the

management of temporary-duty travel reduced the former forty-eight-step procedure to only nine steps, shortening the time required for a person to complete travel arrangements from 9.0 to 1.3 hours. The full processing cycle was reduced from twenty-one days to slightly over two days, a clear improvement in efficiency and cost control.

## Management and Information Systems

Information technology constitutes one of the Force XXI campaign' s three axes.  To  facilitate  the  campaign,  the  Army  Enterprise  Strategy  provides a comprehensive vision for all C4I activities. Information infrastructure, quality  assurance,  modernized  battlefield  communications  and  network management, and battlespace awareness were the Army chief information officer' s  priorities  for  FY  1999.  The  assistant  secretary  of  defense  for command, control, communications, and intelligence recognized the Army commitment to those priorities by designating it as the executive agent for  developing  theater  joint  tactical  networks.  That  decision  combined previous  appointments  as  the  executive  for  joint  network  management (1993) and tactical switching systems (1992), placing responsibility for all theater network infrastructure under the Army' s director of information systems for command, control, communications, and computers (DISC4).

By  sharing  information  networks  at  the  theater  level,  the  armed services can coordinate their activities and leverage their strengths to an unprecedented extent. The potential impact of such technology on joint operations lies at the core of Joint Vision 2010, the operational paradigm for the early twenty-first century. The DISC4 therefore bears responsibility both for ushering Force XXI through the ongoing Revolution in Military Affairs brought about by information systems and new technologies, and for extending the benefits of those technologies through joint applications.

The Joint Network Management System was approved by the Joint Requirements  Board  in  October  1998.  But  the  board  also  required  an assessment  of  the  system' s  key  performance  parameters,  addressing interoperability,  that  was  not  completed  before  the  end  of  FY  1999. Defense Planning Guidance calls for the Army to develop and field the system's threshold requirements by FY 2003; a separate inquiry concluded that  development  and  deployment  of  the  Joint  Network  Management System could not be accelerated to advance that date because of budget constraints.

Similarly, the Army' s future tactical network management systemIntegrated System Control (ISYSCON), a component of the Warfighter Information  System  (Terrestrial)-suffered  from  budgetary  limitations. The system is intended to establish an automated, theater-wide network that signal units can use to manage multiple tactical communications systems

in  support  of  battlefield  operations.  ISYSCON  facilities  will  manage tactical  communications  and  interface  with  each  battlefield  functional area  in  the  Army  Tactical  Command  and  Control  System  architecture. The Army approved full-rate production of the ISYSCON on 5 February 1999. But the FY99 budget precluded fielding thirty systems as originally scheduled, thus hampering the ability of signal units to manage voice and data  networks  as  planned. Although  the  program  continued,  it  failed  to meet its Army acquisition objective and did not have funding restored to programmed levels in the FY00 budget.

AUTODIN, the automatic digital network, which had long served as the principal means of DOD record message transmission, was officially closed  at  the  end  of  FY  1999.  Its  last  four  switching  centers  were redesignated as digital messaging system transition hubs and are scheduled to remain operational to handle message traffic from remaining AUTODIN equipment. The DISC4 also maintained several other previously initiated programs intended to modernize a number of space, communications, and network systems.

During FY 1999, the Army continued to make progress toward the creation of the Army Information Warehouse (AIW), one of the primary initiatives for securing the Army' s information superiority. Based on the Army's strategic vision and a revised record-keeping process, the AIW will collect, protect, and project information to support the Army' s needs. The new record-keeping process itself was developed during FY 1998, reducing the standard 117-step procedure of the Army records management program to a 20-step procedure. As the focus of the Army' s records management efforts during FY 1999, the AIW concept was further defined through the creation of a mission needs statement, approved as an Army requirement and forwarded for review by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. That review is particularly important in light of the Army chief information officer' s FY99 approval of the draft DOD Directive 5015.2. Under the new directive,  responsibility  for  implementing  records  management  policy and procedures for the combatant commands will be transferred from the services to the Joint Staff.

The Army also continued its efforts, begun in 1995, to prepare its information  systems  for  the  arrival  of  the  year  2000.  Many  systems, ranging  from  payroll  programs  to  weapons  platforms  to  the  global positioning satellites, employed software using only two digits to identify the  year.  If  left  uncorrected,  those  systems  could  experience  a  wide range of errors dealing with the double zeros that would represent the year 2000, which they might read as 1900. To deal with this Y ear 2000, or  Y2K,  problem,  more  than  twenty-five  thousand  Army  information systems and six hundred thousand microprocessor-controlled devices had to be prepared and tested, at a cost of some $600 million, before calendar

year 1999 ended. The Internet became a tool in this process, as the Army Y2K homepage provided information for  the  entire Army  community, and Web-enabled databases allowed real-time tracking of efforts to defeat the 'Millennium Bug.'

Army Operations Order 99-1, Millennium Passage, was published in January 1999 to direct Y2K preparations. In response to that order, the Army Operations Center established a Y2K Transition Operations Cell to track the status of systems and installations during transition periods and to monitor worldwide Y2K events that could affect Army operations. An independent examination by the Army Audit Agency validated contingency tests, organized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that verified the Army' s ability to  maintain  its  mobilization,  deployment,  sustainment,  and  intelligence capabilities in the face of major Y2K-related systems failures.

## Economies and Efficiencies

In  FY  1999.  the  Army  continued  to  face  expanding  operational  and  force readiness challenges with limited funds. This reality of America' s postCold War defense posture had a significant impact on all areas of military activity and made cost reduction and fiscal efficiency issues increasingly important  throughout  the Army.  One  telling  example  of  efforts  in  this regard was the secretary of the Army' s order that, after 1 December 1998, paper media would no longer be purchased for administrative publications and forms. The Department of the Army's administrative documents were to be available in electronic form exclusively and to be printed from CDROM or the World Wide Web only when necessary.

Legislative  action  underscored  the  need  for  financial  responsibility and accurate record keeping. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 required major government agencies to prepare auditable financial statements for the first time. The Government Management Reform Act of  1994  extended  the  CFO  Act  to  include  all  major  executive  branch agencies, their components, and the government as a whole. If that was not mandate enough, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA) and the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Clinger-Cohen Act) of the same year required all federal agencies to  develop  integrated  information  systems  to  produce  those  auditable financial reports.

All of that legislation resulted in the publication of the Army Chief Financial  Officers  Strategic  Plan  (General  Fund):  Five  Y ear  Plan  (FY 1999-2003). Through FY 1998, the Army had consistently failed to receive an  unqualified  opinion  from  external  auditors  examining  its  financial statements. As a result of this failure to produce verifiable statements, the Army received special attention in reports to Congress mandated by the

FFMIA-reports by the inspector general, the Office of Management and Budget,  and  the  comptroller  general. The Army Audit Agency  (AAA), which provides internal advice, oversight, and evaluation of the Army' s accounting procedures, itself disclaimed an opinion of the reliability of the Army's financial statements for FY 1998. To correct that state of affairs, the Chief Financial Officers Strategic Plan called for an unqualified opinion on Army financial statements by FY 2003. The five-year effort to meet that goal began in FY 1999.

The AAA began to pursue that end with an internal restructuring to improve its own efficiency. Grouping personnel into dedicated functional areas  enabled  auditors  to  specialize  and  to  receive  function-specific training. The  new  task-focused  orientation  allowed  the  function  groups to build expertise and improved client relationships as it decreased their learning curves and response times. To further this internal transformation, the AAA initiated the Army Follow-Up Program. Under the new practice, functional experts returned to Army activities that the AAA had evaluated to assess the effects of measures undertaken in light of the previous audit. As a whole, this transformation of the AAA should serve as a catalyst for the efficient documentation of Army expenditures and the elimination of unnecessary costs.

Such gains can have immediate operational consequences. The chief of staff, U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army, requested that the AAA create a team in Skopje, Macedonia, to support operations in Kosovo. After its arrival in August 1999, the team provided the deployment commander with real-time assistance in creating and employing management processes and controls to guarantee the effective and appropriate use of resources.

During  a  review  of  the  Army  Strategic  Management  Plan,  the AAA established a new strategic  model  (Audit  Report AA  99-746)  to be  used  throughout  the  Department  of  the  Army.  That  model  directs senior commanders in the creation and implementation of performance management systems similar to those developed for Kosovo, which should assist those commanders in maximizing the efficiency of their accounting procedures.

Despite  its  success  in  overseeing  Army  expenditures,  the  AAA suffered from the same budgetary problems as other establishments. The competitive  labor  market  of  1999  forced  the  agency  to  launch  its  own recruitment efforts to overcome shortages of skilled personnel. Relatively expensive  General  Services  Administration  rents  forced  the  AAA  to relocate its capital field office and Fort Belvoir field office to Army-owned facilities in the Washington, D.C., area. (A similar move was scheduled for the Atlanta field office in FY 2000.)

The accounts of the  AAA itself did not go unchallenged. In a joint series of peer reviews, the AAA audited the Naval Audit Service and was itself

successfully audited by the Air Force Audit Agency. The DOD inspector general conducted two oversight reviews of the AAA, one on the processes used to determine audit requirements and request resources, and one on the Army's internal review organizations. These efforts at rationalizing Army financial records and checking figures proved their worth. In FY 1999, the AAA spent $51.1 million to issue 522 audit reports of various types that identified potential savings projected at $794 million.

## Budget

Reducing  the Army  of  the  Cold  War  era  into  a  more  economical, more mobile, and more lethal institution was neither an easy task nor a rapid  process. The  original Report  on  the  Bottom-Up  Review produced guidance for budgets from FY 1995 through FY 1999. In June 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Defense released the Army Program Objective Memorandum FY 1996-2001, a document that clarified the Army's intent in  the  drawdown  of  forces  to  reflect  new  strategic  and  fiscal  realities. President William J. Clinton' s FY99 budget request for a total obligation authority (TOA) of $64.3 billion supported a force consistent with both of  those  planning  documents.  Congress  appropriated  slightly  less  than requested, giving the Army a TOA of $64 billion.

Table 1 compares the FY99 budget with that of FY 1993, the year in which the Bottom-Up Review originated. The comparison illustrates the impact of the Army's continued restructuring on funding requirements. Even ignoring the effects of inflation, over seven years the Army reduced its  TOA  by  $1.6  billion-almost  $3.1  billion  if  new  expenditures  for chemical weapons demilitarization, environmental restoration, and former DOD programs are disregarded. Constant dollar savings would be significantly greater.

The FY99 budget attempted to preserve mission readiness, enhance modernization, integrate the force structure, and maintain the quality of life for military and civilian personnel. The balance among those needs was an elusive one, for the Army faced an accelerating operational tempo that strained its resources. On a typical day in 1999, the Army had 140,000 personnel abroad in seventy foreign nations-that is, more than 60 percent of U.S. forces were committed to external engagements.

Maintaining  readiness  while  balancing  resources  and  demands  was particularly  difficult.  Because  of  competing  priorities  and  congressional reductions, the Army consistently proved unable to meet its self-imposed goals in combat vehicle training mileage between FYs 1997 and 1999. In FY 1999, M1A1 Abrams tank crews were scheduled to complete 800 miles of training; M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle crews, 934 miles; and M3 Bradley cavalry fighting vehicle crews, 970 miles. Abrams crews recorded

an average of only 681 miles of training for the year; M2 crews, 710 miles; and M3 crews, 573 miles-less than sixty percent of the objective for each type of vehicle.

In  a  similar  vein,  the  Army  National  Guard  Depot  Maintenance Program experienced continuing shortfalls. The  program  is  intended  to repair  equipment  and  return  it  to  its  owning  unit. Although  the  Guard had  no  maintenance  float  that  would  allow  it  to  replace  equipment awaiting overhaul, the program was funded at only 35 percent of its FY99

requirement.  Funding  for  depot  maintenance  for  the  enhanced  separate brigades  held  steady  at  60  percent  of  required  levels,  and  divisions received only 8 percent of the necessary funds. As a result, backlogs of Army National Guard equipment awaiting repair grew in FY 1999 while readiness suffered.

To avoid underfunding such important activities in an era of intense budget scrutiny, the Army endorsed Defense Secretary William S. Cohen' s continuing  efforts  to  reduce  infrastructure  and  overhead  costs.  Savings from  such  decreased  spending  could  then  be  reinvested  to  promote force  readiness  and  modernization.  The  service' s  efforts  bore  fruit  in the  FY99 budget, which included $1.3 billion in savings from ongoing management initiatives designed to promote efficiency. Those funds are not  apparent  through  a  quick  glance  at  budget  totals,  however,  because they  were  reinvested  in  high-priority  tasks. Any  budgetary  comparison needs  to  consider  an  additional  $1.5  billion  that  was  transferred  to  the Army in FY 1999 from the budgets of DOD programs, including chemical demilitarization, commissaries, and defense reform initiatives.

When the transferred programs are included and adjustments are made for inflation, Congress' s $64 billion appropriation for FY 1999 represented a decrease of less than 1 percent from the preceding year. The president' s proposed budget for FY 2000 included $3 billion in additional Army TOA. Such figures may indicate the possible stabilization of, and perhaps even a rebound in, spending authority as the force drawdown neared its 2003 conclusion and operational tempo remained high.

The approved $2.6 billion in pay for military personnel in the active and reserve components remained essentially static from FY 1998, despite a 3.1 percent pay raise, largely the result of continuing decreases in the Army's uniformed strength. The  active  component,  numbering  488,000 personnel in FY 1998, declined to just below its targeted 480,000 for FY 1999. Army  National  Guard  and Army  Reserve  personnel  figures  also decreased to targets of 357,000 and 208,000, respectively, as the reserve components continued their programmed reductions.

Quality of life is a constant concern within the Army. Family housing accounted for $1.2 billion in Army expenditures, including major projects at  Fort  Carson,  Colorado;  Fort  Hood,  Texas;  Fort  Lewis,  Washington; and Fort Meade, Maryland. Of the $1.1 billion appropriated for military construction, $362 million supported barracks renovations and operations, including  new  barracks  for  11,700  soldiers.  Barracks  construction  at Camps Casey and Hovey in Korea received $49 million of the FY99 Korea supplemental appropriation.

Morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs did not fare so well. The Army was able to execute only 87 percent of MWR's programmed mission-sustaining  activities  and  86  percent  of  its  planned  community

support  activities.  Base  commanders  were  forced  to  draw  on  the  $206 million budgeted for these activities within the base support account to meet more pressing needs, thus hampering the scheduled MWR efforts.

Equipment modernization and procurement accounted for $8.5 billion of spending during the fiscal year.  The  Army also established modernization goals for the next decade, an indicator of FY 1999' s transitional role as the force approached a new century and a major milestone in its continued restructuring into Force XXI architecture and eventually the Army After Next. The 1993 Bottom-Up Review had addressed force structure only through 1999. The updated 1999 Army Modernization Plan, with goals similar to the 1995 and 1996 versions, extended the Bottom-Up Review' s priorities and established a series of goals to measure progress toward  Army Vision 2010. The five major modernization goals, which will continue to drive Army procurement through 2010, are (1) digitizing the Army, (2) maintaining combat overmatch, (3) sustaining research and development while focusing on leap-ahead technology, (4) recapitalizing the force, and (5) integrating the active and reserve components.

Procurement activities in 1999 reflected these goals. The Army spent $1.5 billion on weapons and tracked vehicles in 1999. Abrams tank and Bradley  fighting  vehicle  upgrades  directly  supporting  force  digitization accounted for $788 million of that total. Acquisition  of  command-andcontrol  vehicles  to  coordinate  the  improved  flow  of  communications resulting  from  such  modernization  efforts  required  an  additional  $44 million. The  upgrades  and  new  vehicles,  which  incorporated  enhanced thermal imaging, navigational, communications, and identification friend or  foe  systems  to  avert  confusion  and  friendly-fire  incidents,  clearly expanded the Army's ability to overmatch potential enemy forces.

Upgrading Apache attack helicopters to the Longbow configuration, with improved target acquisition and fire-control systems, was the major focus of Army expenditures on aircraft for FY 1999. The $612 million devoted to that program accounted for almost half of the $1.38 billion aviation allocation. Kiowa  Warrior helicopter upgrades, modifications and additions to the fleet of Black Hawk helicopters in various configurations, and  modernization  of  the  CH-47  cargo  helicopter  rounded  out  the aviation program.

Smart,  and  increasingly  brilliant,  weaponry  figured  prominently  in missile spending. Longbow Hellfire, the fire-and-forget antitank missile for use with the Apache Longbow helicopter, was but one component in the  program. The Brilliant Antiarmor (BAT) submunition for the Army Tactical  Missile  System  (ATACMS)  entered  initial  production,  and  the ATACMS missile entered Block II production in the BAT configuration so that it could carry the new warhead. Modifications to Patriot, Stinger, Avenger, TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided), and MLRS

(multiple launch rocket system), and the acquisition of TOW2 and Javelin missiles, contributed to the $1.2 billion expenditure for missiles.

Procurement  of  conventional  ammunition  and  other  needs  required $4.369  billion.  At  the  same  time,  the  Army  continued  its  research, development,  test,  and  evaluation  (RDTE)  efforts  to  provide  the  force with new tools and capabilities. There were no new major initiatives in the $5.022 billion RDTE appropriation. But that appropriation did support the development of a number of technologies vital to the ongoing digitization effort and the implementation of the Force XXI concept.

These technologies included improved night vision systems, control digital networks, and improvements to the Abrams and Bradley weapons platforms.  The  budget  also  supported  continued  development  of  the Comanche helicopter.  Other  efforts  included  research  and  development of BAT submunitions, the Block IIA ATACMS, and the Crusader artillery system, and further developments to the TOW missile. As a whole, the RDTE effort  continued  to  integrate  new  technology  into  weapons  and weapons systems while exploring alternative concepts in future capabilitiesbased warfighting.

The president's proposed FY00 budget maintained the same goals and  strategic  assumptions  as  did  the  FY99  budget. Table  2  compares the two budgets, showing the general increases the president suggested. The increased funding requirements of the FY00 budget underline the significance of FY 1999 as a transitional year, one marking the end of a decade of decreases in the Army budget. The tight budget of FY 1999 left  little  room for unforeseen contingency operations without adverse impact  on  readiness  and  other  Army  concerns.  Subsequent  increases in funding requests for personnel, operations, and maintenance for FY 2000 are indicative of the challenges awaiting the Army as it entered the next decade.

## Personnel

In  FY  1999,  the  active  Army  declined  from  483,880  personnel  to 479,426. The loss of nearly thirty-five hundred personnel through normal attrition placed the force in line with its authorized strength of 480,000 officers  and  enlisted  members. The  68,935  commissioned  and  enlisted women  of  the  active Army  constituted  14.7  percent  of  the  force. That percentage was expected to continue to rise, with 90 percent of all Army occupations  and  70  percent  of  all  positions  open  to  women  as  of  FY 1999. More than 20 percent of new personnel in FY 1999 were female, surpassing the minimum goal of 18 percent. African-Americans composed 26.5 percent of the force; Hispanics, 7.6 percent; and Caucasians, 59.2 percent.  Other  groups  made  up  the  remaining  6.7  percent  of  the  active Army's personnel. For comparison, in 1999 the U.S. population of 17-19year-olds was 14.2 percent African-American, 14.9 percent Hispanic, 66 percent Caucasian, and 4.9 percent of other heritage.

Membership in the Army National Guard (ARNG) decreased by 4,975 members, to a total of 357,469. This left the ARNG at 100.1 percent of its authorized strength of 357,223 personnel. The 37,607 women serving in  the  ARNG  accounted  for  11.75  percent  of  the  total  force.  AfricanAmericans composed 15.6 percent of the ARNG, and the 1,574 Hispanic officers and 23,212 Hispanic enlisted members accounted for 6.9 percent of ARNG personnel. The 257,579 Caucasians in the ARNG made up 73.8 percent of the force; Asians and Pacific Islanders, 1.8 percent; and Native Americans, 0.8 percent; with 1.1 percent of ARNG personnel identifying themselves as of other or unknown ethnic origin.

In contrast to the reductions of the active Army and the ARNG, the Army Reserve (USAR) expanded by 1,868 members, despite substantial recruiting shortfalls. Its FY99 end strength of 206,836 still remained below the authorized level of 208,003 officers and enlisted men and women. The 50,710 female USAR personnel composed 24.52 percent of the total force. African-Americans,  Hispanics, Asians  and  Pacific  Islanders,  and  those identifying their ethnicity as other or unknown were also more prominent in  the  Reserve  than  in  the  Guard,  at  25.4,  8.0,  3.3,  and  2.7  percent, respectively. Caucasians made up 60.1 percent of USAR personnel, and

Note: ARNG = Army National Guard, USAR = U.S. Army Reserve.

0.5 percent were Native Americans. Total end strength figures, authorized and actual, for the active Army, the ARNG, and the USAR in FYs 1998 and 1999 are shown in Table 3.

Both  of  the  reserve  components  faced  a  continuing  and  serious shortage  of  full-time  support  personnel  during  the  fiscal  year.  These personnel constitute the critical  portion  of  reserve  units  responsible  for routine  administration,  logistics,  recruiting,  retention,  and  operations. Shortages  in  support  positions  adversely  affect  the  preparedness  of reserve-component units. Such personnel fall into four categories: activeduty Guard and Reserve members performing administrative and support functions, dual-status military technicians who are participating reservists as  a  condition  of  their  employment,  active Army  personnel  attached  to reserve  formations,  and  civil  service  employees. Table  4  lists  full-time personnel required, authorized, and actually assigned to the Army Reserve and Army National Guard.

The ratio  of  full-time  personnel  authorizations  to  validated  requirements reached an all-time low in FY 1999. The USAR was authorized at only 62.1 percent of its requirement; the ARNG at 72.5 percent. In contrast, the ratio of authorizations to requirements was 99 percent for the Naval Reserve, 97 percent for the Marine Corps Reserve, 92 percent for the Air National Guard, 94 percent for the Air Force Reserve, and 100 percent for the Coast Guard Reserve. At the end of the fiscal year, the Department of Defense (DOD) was reviewing full-time support programs and procedures to address this disparity.

Another  discrepancy  might  have  become  a  serious  complication for  the  accession  of  first-term  recruits  in  FY  1999.  Despite  clear  goals defined by the Quadrennial Defense Review and force reduction plans, the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) did not receive sufficient funds to execute its training mission. By February 1999, the TRADOC reported that it lacked the resources necessary to meet the Army' s needs, predicting shortfalls in training spaces for new enlisted personnel of 6,900

in  the  active Army  and  9,300  in  the  reserve  components,  as  well  as  a deficit of 500 training spaces for newly commissioned officers by the end of the fiscal year. Actual year-end accession figures were almost 16,500 below the target, rendering the problem moot. If recruiting had been fully successful in 1999, the Army might not have been able to train that many new personnel.

## Enlisted Personnel

The strong economy and low rate of civilian unemployment proved to be a serious obstacle to first-term enlistments in FY 1999. In an attempt to  meet  recruiting  goals  in  that  challenging  environment,  the  Army

supplemented its standard enlistment bonus program for those men and women entering a critical military occupational specialty (MOS). All such bonuses were limited to a maximum of $6,000 for a two-year enlistment or $12,000 for four or more years. The added incentives were a seasonal bonus to equalize the flow of recruits to training facilities, the 'HIGRAD' bonus  of  $4,000  for  applicants  with  thirty  or  more  semester  hours  of college,  and  the  $3,000 Airborne  bonus  for  those  selecting  an  airborne MOS and agreeing to become airborne qualified. To widen the pool of potential personnel, the Army also initiated a five-year experiment in which graduates of home-schooling programs would be considered high school graduates for enlistment purposes. But first-term enlisted accessions still failed to meet established targets. Those targets are compared with actual accessions in Table 5.

The active Army contained 398,155 enlisted personnel at the end of FY 1999. In response to the shortage of new enlistees, the Army adjusted its FY99 retention goal from the original 62,300 to 65,000. To meet that goal, the rule requiring reenlistment to be initiated ninety days prior to separation from service was waived. This encouraged retention officers to further sharpen the focus of their reenlistment efforts on personnel in the final year of their enlistments. The appeal of the 3.1 percent increase in base pay authorized in the FY99 budget also aided retention efforts, which exceeded the increased goal with 71,147 reenlistments. Active-component retention rates for enlisted personnel are presented in Table 6.

table 6-enlisteD aCtive armY retention: FY 1999

| Personnel    | Goal   | Obtained   |   Percentage |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Initial-term | 20,200 | 20,843     |        103.2 |
| Mid-career   | 23,000 | 24,174     |        105.1 |
| Career       | 21,800 | 26,130     |        119.9 |
| Total        | 65,000 | 71,147     |        109.5 |

The introduction of an indefinite-reenlistment program improved personnel retention. This new option sought to stabilize the noncommissioned officer  corps  and  to  encourage  career  service  commitments.  Beginning  in FY 1999, personnel with ten years of uniformed service and grades of E-6 or higher are given the option of reenlisting for an indefinite term instead of the standard two- to six-year commitment. Personnel selecting that option are formalizing their commitment to an Army career and continue to serve until retirement or, as with officers, until they resign or exceed time-in-grade limits without promotion.

The Army Reserve continued to fall slightly short of its authorized strength  in  FY  1999,  despite  exceeding  its  goal  for  non-prior-service recruits by 132 through a major recruiting campaign. A decline in priorservice  recruitment  and  decreasing  interest  in  reserve  service  were  the greatest  obstacles  in  reaching  authorized  force  levels.  To  correct  the problem, 186 additional Reserve recruiters began to join the existing force of 1,318 as the fiscal year ended. At their disposal as incentives were a newly approved $8,000 bonus for non-prior-service recruits and expanded benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill.

Enlisted  personnel  accounted  for  only  161,930  of  the  Reserve' s 206,836-person  strength.  At  78  percent,  this  was  the  lowest  enlisted composition of the three force components. Enlisted personnel composed 83.6 percent of the active Army, and the Guard's enlisted force was 89 percent of the total. The Reserve was also relatively lacking in warrant officers, who made up only 1.4 percent of all personnel, as opposed to the active Army's 2.4 percent and the Guard' s 2.2 percent.

This comparative shortage in enlisted personnel and warrant officers is partly explained  by  the  Reserve' s structure.  The  Army  Reserve includes both the Individual Ready Reserve and Individual Mobilization Augmentees  (IMAs),  categories  unique  to  the  Reserve  that  distort  any direct  comparison  of  force  composition.  Officers  accounted  for  6,388 of the 8,019 IMAs in FY 1999, a substantial surplus over the authorized 4,748 officers and the major reason for the apparent imbalance. If IMA personnel  are  ignored,  Reserve  enlisted  personnel  accounted  for  81.45 percent of the force, bringing the USAR' s composition much closer to that of the other Army components.

The Army National Guard enlisted 26,085 non-prior-service personnel in FY 1999, only 91.5 percent of the objective. Prior-service accessions made up the shortfall, with the Guard achieving 108.9 percent of its target at  31,005.  The  combination  amounted  to  57,090  new  ARNG  enlisted members, or 100.2 percent of the programmed objective of 56,958.

In  FY  1999,  the ARNG formed an enlisted personnel management review panel to examine current practices and procedures and to propose improvements  in  the  ARNG's  personnel  management.  Among  topics

considered by the panel were the promotion system, assignment cycles, and access to training. The panel recommended some minor changes in the promotion system that are scheduled for implementation in FY 2000.

The  ARNG's examination of enlisted personnel policies corresponded with the activities of the Force Integration Division of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. In addition to reviewing enlisted promotion standards, the division examined MOS designations and  structures  as  part  of  a  service-wide  multiyear  effort  to  validate standards  of  grade  and  to  clarify  the  grade  and  career  progression paths within each MOS. The various new standards were scheduled for publication in FYs 2000-03.

## Officer Personnel

There were 77,152 officers in the active Army at the end of FY 1999, including 11,633 warrant officers. More than 13 percent of the total, 10,522 commissioned and warrant officers, were female. Of the commissioned officers, 11.3 percent were African-American, 3.8 percent were Hispanic, and  78.5  percent  were  Caucasian.  People  of  mixed  heritage  and  other groups made up 6.4 percent of the officer corps. The composition of the warrant  officer  ranks  was  similar:  15.7  percent  African-American,  5.0 percent Hispanic, 74.1 percent Caucasian, and the remaining 5.2 percent in other categories. Table 7 shows the total number of active Army officers by grade.

New officers enter the service through several paths.  The Reserve Officer Training Corps program at the nation' s colleges and universities continues to be the primary source of new officers, while graduates of the U.S. Military Academy  provide  the  professionally  educated  heart  of  the  junior  officer corps. Officer Candidate School provides another route to commissioning, and the  Judge Advocate General Corps, Army Medical Department, and Chaplain Corps each maintain their own professional programs. New officer accessions for FY 1999 are totaled by source in Table 8.

Army officers normally become eligible for grade advancement when a standardized schedule places them in the zone of consideration after a predetermined length of service. They may also be considered above or below that standard zone of promotion when circumstances warrant. Table 9 lists the average length of service at promotion and the standard length of service for promotion, by rank, for FY 1999. The schedule was established by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980.

| Rank               |   Average Length of Service (Years) | Standard Length of Service (Years)   |

Officers  are  considered  as  fully  members  of  the  career  force  upon promotion to the rank of captain, and they may continue to serve until their time  in  grade  without  promotion  exceeds  established  limits. The Army continued  to  meet  the  DOPMA  standards  in  the  promotion  of  officers, as shown in Table 10, an achievement that escaped its grasp in the early 1990s as force reduction efforts and the legislated promotional windows conflicted. That  awkward  transition  ended  when  force  levels  stabilized. In  fact,  the  percentage  of  considered  officers  selected  for  promotion  in 1999 was higher than the same figure for the Cold War Army of 1989, and promotions came somewhat faster, as shown in Table 11.

Assessing officer  performance  for  development  and  promotion  is  a challenge. In FY 1999, the Army furthered its efforts to establish more sophisticated and useful analytical tools for those processes. The chief of staff directed the Center for Army Leadership (CAL) to test a leadership assessment  program  in  operational  units,  based  on  earlier  trials  at  Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, with students in the Combined Arms and Services Staff School and the Command General Staff Officer Course of the Army Command and General Staff College. The program provides leaders with performance feedback from superiors, peers, and subordinates. As a result of the combination of evaluations from all perspectives, the CAL labeled the program a '360-degree' assessment. The two test programs, conducted in  the  212th  Field Artillery  Brigade, Third  Corps Artillery,  at  Fort  Sill, Oklahoma, and the First Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division (Mechanized), at Fort Hood, Texas, proved successful enough that the CAL suggested an expansion of the development program in FY 2000.

Managing personnel assignments to meet the needs of the Army and the  interests  and  career  aspirations  of  individual  officers  is  a  challenge undertaken  by  the  Officer  Personnel  Management  Directorate  (OPMD), Army Personnel Command. On 1 September 1999, OPMD reestablished the central Colonels Division, which had been disbanded in 1997, to manage the assignments of colonels. In the two-year interim, basic branch assignment officers or functional area managers had made colonel assignments, and many  branch  chiefs  had  managed  colonel  assignments  personally.  The restored division eliminated that burden on branch chiefs, permitting them to  concentrate their personnel development efforts elsewhere. In its new form,  the  Colonels  Division  enabled  assignment  officers  to  focus  their efforts  within  their  own  basic  branch,  managing  the  assignments  and professional development of the individual colonels in that branch.

## Civilian Personnel

The Army's  civilian  workforce  declined  by  seventy-seven  hundred members in FY 1999, from 232,600 to 224,900 employees. Overall, the

civilian workforce was down 44 percent from its FY89 strength of 402,900, reflecting the general force reduction as the Army transforms itself from its  Cold War orientation to the Force XXI structure. In the process, the workforce has aged.  The average Department of the  Army civilian employee was 46.6 years old in FY 1999, up from 43.0 ten years earlier. Average length of service also increased, from 13.5 to 17.2 years. These figures imply a troubling, disproportionate decline in the numbers of entry-level personnel. As the leadership of the Army' s civilian workforce ages toward retirement,  it  may  experience  difficulty  in  locating  a  sufficiently  broad talent pool of experienced potential successors.

In response to that concern, the training, education, and professional development of the civilian workforce have been a priority in recent years. The DOD instituted the Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP)  in  1997  to  prepare  administrators  for  senior  positions.  The DLAMP  consists  of  defense-focused  graduate  education,  rotational assignments,  and  professional  military  education  to  prepare  civilians for  key  leadership  positions.  Fourteen  new  graduate  courses  joined  the DLAMP's existing thirteen courses in 1999. This expansion of the young but  already  successful  program  was  assisted  by  Secretary  of  Defense William S. Cohen's appointment of the first chancellor for education and professional development on October 2, 1998. The chancellor serves as the advocate for all DOD higher education and professional development programs for civilian personnel.

Management  of  the  Army's  civilian  personnel  is  being  centralized as  part  of  the  Army  Enterprise  Strategy' s  ongoing  effort  to  maximize efficiency. A total of ten regional Civilian Personnel Operations Centers (CPOCs) replaced individual  post  and  command  facilities  in  FY  1999, coordinating  personnel  selection  and  administration. The  South  Central CPOC became the first to reach full operational capability, doing so in the closing days of FY 1998, on 27 September. It serves nine major commands, including the U.S. Army Materiel Command and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, its largest clients.

On 1 October, the North Central CPOC also attained full capability, serving  the  facilities  of  three  major  commands  in  eight  different states,  plus  some  activities  in  Colorado  and Texas  that  lay  beyond  its otherwise designated geographic borders. The North Central CPOC was subsequently designated as the Army's single-source recruiter for career interns.  It  also  developed  and  fielded  the  Resumix  online  applicant response system, an automated tool that enables applicants to view the status  of  their  résumés. The  system  was  quickly  adopted  as  the Army standard, with interest from other DOD agencies. By the end of the fiscal year, all ten CPOCs were fully operational, serving almost 100 percent of the Army's civilian labor force.

## Families

Family support contributes substantially to the total quality of life for servicemembers, in turn improving morale, individual mission readiness, retention rates, and first-term enlistments. Simple demographics indicate the importance of family issues to today' s Army. The 479,426 active Army personnel in FY 1999 had a total of 714,486 immediate family members: 250,908  spouses,  459,052  children,  and  4,526  adult  dependents.  Army parents-52.8 percent of commissioned officers, 75.7 percent of warrant officers,  and  47.9  percent  of  enlisted  personnel-have  an  average  of two children each; 4.0 percent of all officers and 8.4 percent of enlisted personnel are sole parents. Some of these parents face difficulties with very basic matters, including household finances. Army commissaries redeemed $6.8 million in food stamps and $8.7 million in vouchers for the federally supported Women, Infants, and Children nutritional program in FY 1999.

Female  servicemembers  of  all  ranks  are  less  likely  to  be  married than their male peers, as Table 12 shows, but Table 13 demonstrates that those who are married are far more likely to have a spouse who is also in military service. The unique challenges of a dual military marriage, faced by roughly 6 percent of Army personnel, confront almost 20 percent of all women and less than 4 percent of all men in the service. Thus the Army' s ability to support uniformed couples may well have particular significance for the quality of life of female personnel.

Secretary of Defense William J. Perry recognized the impact of family issues  on  overall  quality  of  life  in  1995  when  he  created  the  Quality  of Life Executive Committee. That committee includes family issues in four of its six guiding principles: providing servicemembers and families safe, modern communities and housing; making educational opportunities for servicemembers and their families a cornerstone of quality-of-life programs; ensuring parity in quality-of-life programs across installations and services as  servicemembers and their families move between them; and building solid communications with servicemembers and their families.

| Enlisted personnel |    6.9 |     42.2 |          11.5 |

Such issues are addressed within the Army through a number of programs.  The  Army  Family  Action  Plan  (AFAP)  identifies  issues of concern through Army family symposiums at all command levels and  through AFAP  conferences  and  meetings  of  the AFAP  General Officer Steering Committee, held in alternating years. The 1999 AFAP conference identified for discussion 127 separate issues, in nine major categories. With the assistance of subject matter experts, conference members  voiced  their  concerns  and  identified  possible  solutions, producing a list  of  priorities  for  the  attention  of Army  leaders. The list  contained  27  new  issues,  which  were  added  to  the  37  matters previously identified for action by the steering committee. Delegates also voted for the five most valuable services offered to Army families. The most valued services for 1999, in descending order, were medical and dental care, Army housing, the commissary, the AFAP itself, and retirement services.

Some of the issues that  the AFAP addresses  are  quite  specific.  For example, the Directorate of Human Resources of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel administers the Adolescent Substance Abuse Counseling  Service  (ASACS).  In  1999,  that  service  provided  intensive substance  abuse  prevention  support  to  at-risk  teens,  efforts  proven  by experience  to  be  more  successful  than  the  general  educational  mission that the ASACS held at its 1980 inception. The service has proven to be popular as well as effective, and in some posts may be the only adolescent counseling program available. The AFAP continues to voice strong support for the ASACS program.

More general issues of family support are addressed at the unit level. Family support groups emerged when Guard and Reserve units struggled to  meet  the  needs  and  concerns  of  the  family  members  of  personnel mobilized for the Gulf War. These family support groups are largely staffed by volunteers supported by local commanders and Army policy. They act as an information conduit and point of contact between family members and the military chain of command, seeking to integrate family members fully into the Army team.

The Army Family Liaison Office supports the activities of the family support groups and, in 1999, added a paid position specifically set aside for an Army spouse. The selected spouse serves under contract to provide technical research and support to the Army Family Liaison Office, based on familiarity with installation quality-of-life programs, facilities, and issues, particularly from the perspective of an Army family member. The holder of the position also assists in defining and implementing plans, policies, procedures,  evaluation  criteria,  and  reporting  requirements  to  improve operational efficiency and effectiveness within the Family Liaison Office.

## Special Topics

The 364th Infantry Regiment, an African-American unit stationed at Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi, during the fall of 1943 was the focal point of  allegations  that  the Army  massacred  more  than  one  thousand  of  its soldiers and covered up the crime. In The Slaughter: An American Atrocity, author Carroll Case used local legends and rumors as the inspiration for a novel making these claims. Primarily a work of fiction about the alleged massacre, The Slaughter contained a short nonfiction section describing Case's  investigation  of  the  rumors.  That  section  caused  the  Library  of Congress to categorize the entire work as nonfiction, which contributed to the controversy the book raised when it was published in the summer of 1998. In 1999, Mississippi Congressman Bennie G. Thompson and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People requested that the Department of Defense and the Department of the Army determine if there was any truth to the story.

In  response  to  questions  raised  about The  Slaughte r,  the  assistant secretary  of  the  Army  for  manpower  and  reserve  affairs  assigned  the Army Center of Military History (CMH) the task of fully documenting the history of the 364th during World War II, seeking any indication of unusual  or  inexplicable  loss  of  personnel.  Subsequent  exploration  of records at the National Archives and Records Administration, including the National Personnel Records Center, found no evidence of the alleged massacre and subsequent cover-up. The CMH traced all officers and men assigned to the unit during the war to their separation from service and randomly surveyed veterans of the unit from the fall of 1943. The veterans discounted the possibility of such an event, and the research revealed no unexplained  disappearances,  large-scale  transfers,  or  other  events  that could have hidden mass murders.

Instead,  the  history  of  the  364th  that  emerged  documented  the challenges facing an African-American unit serving in the southern United States under trying circumstances. Racism, poor leadership, and adverse conditions combined to create several incidents involving the regiment.

Those incidents became the subjects of rumor and exaggeration, and a local legend bearing little resemblance to the actual events began to develop. The events themselves are clear. By late 1942, the unit was under investigation for allegations of poor leadership and conduct. A drunken brawl between a soldier of the 364th and an African-American military policeman of the 733d Military Police Battalion on Thanksgiving Day 1942 resulted in an accidental  shooting  in  downtown  Phoenix, Arizona.  When  exaggerated accounts of the incident reached their camp, members of the 364th seized weapons and headed for town. Before order could be restored, men from the unit and local police had exchanged fire. Two soldiers and one civilian died in the confrontation, which left fourteen other people injured.

Fifteen men from the regiment were court-martialed over the riot before the unit departed for predeployment training at Camp Van Dorn. Rumor and a grim reputation preceded the unit into Mississippi. On the afternoon of 30 May 1943, Pvt. William Walker of the newly arrived 364th struggled with a white military policeman in the small town of Centerville. Three local police officers intervened, and Sheriff R. Whitaker shot and killed Walker. As had happened previously, men from the regiment remaining in camp responded to the incident in town, this time by assembling at a post exchange and seizing weapons from the Company C arms room. When military police arrived, they were rushed by men from the unit and fired several shots to halt the crowd. One struck a bystander in the leg. Col. John Goodman, the regimental commander, arrived shortly thereafter and reestablished control. The incident triggered a number of investigations by the War Department and eventually resulted in the unit, scheduled for the European Theater, being deployed to Alaska. It served well as a garrison force in the Aleutian Islands.

In 1944, Camp Van Dorn was the scene of another event in the area formerly occupied by the men of the 364th Infantry Regiment.  Two  AfricanAmerican soldiers struggled in the post exchange, and a soldier from the 1697th Engineer Combat Battalion was stabbed. Soldiers from his unit seized their weapons and fired on the barracks of the 394th Quartermaster Company, thought to be the knife-wielder's unit. The entire camp heard the fusillade, which left the two men wounded and the barracks clearly damaged by rifle fire.

These  three  incidents  and  the  rumors  that  surrounded  them  appear to  be  the  slender  factual  foundation  for  Case' s  fictional  massacre. The investigation  prompted  by  Case' s  allegations  of  murder  and  conspiracy discovered no evidence of atrocity or cover-up, no personnel unaccounted for,  and  no  suspicions  or  allegations  among  veterans  of  the  unit  in question.

A more substantive personnel issue emerged in July 1998 with the secretary of defense' s call for a revision of policies on personal relationships

between military members of different rank. The Army' s resulting revision to  AR  600-20, Command  Policy, became  effective  on  2  March  1999. The Army's former prohibition of personal or business relationships that compromise  the  chain  of  command,  are  exploitative  or  unfair,  lead  to partiality, or otherwise affect good order and discipline, remained in effect. In addition, relationships between officers, including warrant officers, and enlisted personnel were prohibited. Existing marriages and relationships between members of the National Guard and Reserve arising primarily out of their civilian occupations were excluded from the regulation' s provisions, which included a brief period to resolve newly prohibited relationships.

Abuse of controlled substances remained a major concern of Army personnel  policy  in  FY  1999. The Army  continued  its  substance  abuse programs in an effort to protect the health, reliability, and morale of military and civilian personnel. As the greatest deterrence to the abuse of controlled substances, testing provided the cornerstone of the Army' s efforts. Activeand reserve-component personnel and civilians in positions with critical safety  or  security  requirements  are  randomly  tested.  Specimens  from military personnel are examined in two forensic drug-testing laboratories for cocaine, THC, and amphetamines. Alternating tests for PCP , opiates, LSD, and barbiturates are included in the process, which may also include examination for anabolic steroids when requested by a commanding officer. Civilians are examined for THC and cocaine and, on a rotating basis, for PCP, amphetamines, and opiates. The overall positive rate for drug testing was 1.12 percent in FY 1999. Table 14 gives test results by group.

The Army Center for Substance Abuse Programs (ACSAP) provides policy, training, and assistance in all aspects of the Army Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program. During FY 1999, the international accounting  and  consulting  firm  PricewaterhouseCoopers  completed  an external evaluation of the program under an ACSAP contract. The review concluded that the  Army' s substance abuse programs had deteriorated since the  firm' s  1994  evaluation. That  decline  was  primarily  attributed  to  the loss of staff and resources. In addition, a lack of standardization, defense

of local programs, and current promulgated policy hampered efforts and contributed to the discouragement and demoralization of program staff. The  review  recommended  formation  of  a  task  force  to  reorganize  the program, suggesting it consider the possibilities of contracting the activity out,  adopting private industry' s employee assistance program model for Army use, or combining the two solutions.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint for the Future

In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin called for a review of U.S. defense strategy 'from the bottom up.' The Report of the Bottom-Up Review (BUR), as approved by Secretary Aspin, contained strategic and budgetary guidance for  FYs  1995  through  1999. That  guidance  initiated  a  wave  of Department of Defense (DOD) and service policy and doctrinal changes that continue to influence the Army. In FY 1994, Army planners responded to the BUR by deciding that the Cold War Army of Excellence should adapt itself to the emerging information age. That adaptation process also reflected the realities of America' s changing strategic goals and economic realities, and provided the Army' s blueprint for the future. As the last year specifically described in the BUR, FY 1999 marks a milestone in the Army' s ongoing struggle to transform itself into an information-age fighting force.

The effort began in FY 1994 with the launch of the Force XXI campaign, a plan to redesign operational forces, reinvent the institutional Army, and develop and acquire advanced information technologies. The Force XXI Army  would  be  smaller,  more  flexible,  more  durable,  and  more  lethal than the Cold War force, well suited to joint and multinational operations across the full spectrum of conflict. By FY 1999, the major initiatives of the campaign had been launched, its strategies largely determined. Army leadership could focus on executing Force XXI programs rather than on developing new concepts.

Force XXI was scheduled to become reality by 2010. Planned reform efforts would continue long past that date, however, as the Army continued to  seek  a  revolutionary  leap  beyond  its  1990s  capabilities  and  their evolutionary successors of the Force XXI Army. By 2025, current plans will have materialized into the objective force, Army After Next (AAN). The exact composition and technology of AAN, and the link between it and  Force  XXI,  remained  vague  concepts  even  as  the Army  continued implementing Force XXI programs during FY 1999.

But AAN is defined by several characteristics that are inherent in its role  as  the  successor  to  Force  XXI,  the  intermediate  step  between  the current Army and the Army of 2025. As it develops, AAN will embrace and enhance the defining capabilities of the Army of 2010. Fully digitized and composed of updated versions of current forces and newly developed interim  forces,  Force  XXI  will  enjoy  real-time  situational  awareness throughout  the  theater  of  operations  and  beyond.  Joint  and  combined forces will share information through networked systems and receive an accurate,  real-time  picture  of  the  battlespace.  Those  same  information networks will provide logistics personnel with an accurate picture of the Army's stores and requirements, speeding the flow of essential materials from factory to front. Six balanced imperatives-leadership development, modern equipment, sound doctrine, proper force mix, superior training, and quality people-will combine in Force XXI to produce an army able to rapidly project the right mix of forces to any part of the world to achieve decisive results as part of joint and multinational operations.

From  the  intermediate  step  of  Force  XXI,  the  Army  plans  a revolutionary  leap  into  AAN,  combining  new  weapons  systems  and doctrines  with  the  network-centric,  information-age  capabilities  of  the Army of 2010. AAN will leverage information technology in all mission areas, deploy and operate with unparalleled speed, and dominate the full spectrum of conflict. Within ninety-six hours of a decision to deploy, earlyentry  forces  and  a  new,  flexibly  structured  strike  force  will  be  combat ready in a trouble zone anywhere in the world. Only twenty-four hours later, that initial force will have been reinforced by a second strike force and a mechanized brigade that is lighter and more lethal than its 1999 counterpart. If necessary, a full three-division corps will be on the scene in only thirty days, sustained by improved sea and airlift capabilities and stocks of pre-positioned equipment.

This  goal,  announced  in  Joint Vision  2010,  motivated  the Army's efforts  through  FY  1999. Army  leaders  spent  much  of  the  fiscal  year articulating a new vision statement to encapsulate the Army's core values and  its  intent  in  pursuing  Force  XXI  and  AAN  reforms.  The  vision statement was being prepared for release in early FY 2000 and would confirm the Army's dedication to its traditional mission and values while further clarifying its future plans.

## Force Development

A successful military force maintains a degree of conservatism even as it plans for the future. The importance of the Army' s mission demands that the transition from known and proven techniques to untried methods be a cautious one; that the shift from the present structure through Force

XXI to AAN not leave the nation militarily, diplomatically, or financially vulnerable. For that reason the  Army will maintain and modernize elements of its existing force as it assembles the first units of the interim force that will lead the Army toward AAN.

This  effort  involves  three  distinct,  but  related,  patterns  of  force development. To ensure near-term readiness, selected units of the existing force  are  being  recapitalized,  or  provided  with  an  infusion  of  new equipment and funds, and furnished with digital technologies. Although superficially similar to the Army of the early 1990s, this updated force will be more lethal, flexible, and survivable than its predecessor, thus marking an evolutionary step into information-age warfare. Preparations to make that step were the major theme in force development for FY 1999.

Establishing the foundations of the interim force and its constituent units was the second developmental theme for FY 1999. The first Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) is planned to become operational as the foundation of the interim force shortly after the beginning of the twentyfirst century. It will bridge the gap between the evolutionary update of the existing force and the revolutionary objective force. Light, mobile, and fully  digitized,  the  interim  brigades  will  feature  combined  arms  at  the company level and will be capable of beginning operations immediately on arrival in theater. Mission-capable across the full spectrum of operations, an IBCT will fight with unprecedented speed and efficiency, in a manner hinting at the capabilities of AAN. Interim and updated units, combined with a streamlined institutional army  employing  modern  business practices and corresponding doctrinal changes is intended to constitute Force XXI.

Research into the technologies, doctrines, and strategies of the objective force formed the Army' s third developmental focus in 1999. Ultimately, the interim force will adopt new technologies and smoothly develop into AAN. Envisioned as a thoroughly networked, mission-oriented system of systems rather  than  the  platform-focused,  task-specific  combat  force  of  1999, AAN will represent a revolutionary transformation in land-based combat. Reduced to its simplest expression,  AAN will conduct operations as a single, theater-level entity reaching back to its support base in the installations and factories of the continental United States. Such a structure will differ from the 1999 construct of discrete but interdependent units separated in space, time, and information from their support systems and each other.

As these plans to field information-age forces imply, the Army devoted considerable attention to information technology in FY 1999. A series of advanced warfighting experiments allowed the Army to validate the tools and concepts for a digitized division, scheduled to be fully equipped by the end of FY 2000, and for the eventual digitization of the entire force. Acquisition  programs  reflected  the  goal  of  Army  digitization.  System

enhancement programs (SEP) for the M1A1D and M1A2 Abrams tanks began  to  provide  crews  with  digital  command-and-control  capabilities. Thus equipped, tank crews eventually will be able to share information with Bradley fighting vehicles that began undergoing a similar upgrade in  1997.  Research  and  development  continued  on  the  Crusader,  a  fully digitized and automated self-propelled artillery piece capable of operating with the older systems in the network environment.

An engagement fought by older Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles provides a context for understanding the increased capabilities information technology is bringing to the existing force. On the evening of 26 February 1991, the 2d Squadron, 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment, and 1st Infantry Division engaged elements of the Iraqi 18th Mechanized and 37th Armored Brigades in the Battle of 73 Easting. The 3d Brigade, 1st Infantry, unknowingly overran and bypassed Iraqi forces during the battle, and for several hours American troops had to contend with small enemy units executing surprise attacks on passing vehicles. At one point, Abrams  and  Bradley  commanders  reoriented  their  turrets  to  engage enemy armor to their rear, causing advancing friendly crews behind their targets to return the apparently hostile fire. Five American tanks and four Bradley vehicles were destroyed in the incident, killing six U.S. soldiers and wounding thirty more.

In the same situation, the newly digitized Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting  vehicles  would  have  had  access  to  real-time  information  from other vehicles, multiplying their effectiveness, lethality, and survivability. The  presence  and  exact  location  of  hostile  units  within  the  formation would have been known throughout the force as each was identified, and the location of all friendly vehicles would have been available to vehicle commanders. If the resulting situational awareness did not avert confusion, improved identification friend or foe systems would have offered better protection from friendly fire. Linked to this information, Crusader crews supporting the advance could have rapidly identified and engaged pockets of resistance where appropriate-a daunting task for the artillery present at 73 Easting. The addition of information-age technologies to the same tanks and infantry fighting vehicles that fought that battle would transform the capabilities of the existing force.

The  Army formally accepted the first M1A2 SEP  Abrams on 1 September 1999. In the same ceremony it also accepted the first Wolverine assault bridge launcher. Built on the M1A2 SEP chassis, the Wolverine provides the Army with a mobile bridging system capable of keeping pace with the Abrams on the battlefield. The new mobile bridge is another effort to improve the mobility of Army forces, offering commanders the ability to bridge obstacles up to seventy-two feet across without exposing unprotected troops to hostile fire or slowing operations to await the older bridge launcher.

The Army also continued to recapitalize its aviation assets and other vital systems. During FY 1999, previously approved programs updating the Apache,  Kiowa Warrior,  Black  Hawk,  and  CH-47  helicopter  fleets enhanced  the  Army's  capabilities  across  the  full  mission  spectrum. Additional  modernization  efforts  included  acquiring  improved  smart weapons and other technologies to expand the capabilities of the existing force and prepare for the first digitized division and the first IBCT.

## Training

The  new  technology  and  bold  plans  for  future  developments  are pointless,  however,  without  soldiers  capable  of  maintaining  and  using sophisticated  equipment  and  concepts.  Toward  that  end  the  Army maintained  its  training  and  educational  efforts  in  FY  1999.  At  the beginning of the fiscal year, basic training and one-station unit training were  expanded  by  one  week.  Much  of  the  time  gained  was  devoted to  values  training,  which  stressed  the  core  concepts  of  loyalty,  duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. A total of 105,034 soldiers completed basic training in FY 1999, and the Army trained  65,286  personnel  in  specific  military  occupational  specialties. An initiative titled Future Army Schools XXI established a Total Army School System to integrate advanced education throughout the active and reserve components. The Army is well aware that basic skills, technical competence,  and  continuing  education  are  indispensable  attributes  of military personnel.

The  centerpiece  of  Army  training  has  long  been  the  combat training  center  (CTC)  program.  As  components  of  that  program,  the Combined  Arms  Center  (CAC)  at  Fort  Leavenworth  (Kansas),  the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) at Hohenfels (Germany), the  Joint  Readiness Training  Center  (JRTC)  at  Fort  Polk  (Louisiana), and the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin (California) have subjected Army units and personnel to highly realistic combat exercises. By doing so, the CTC program aspires to five goals: (1) increase unit readiness for deployment and warfighting; (2) produce bold, innovative leaders through stressful tactical and operational exercises; (3) embed doctrine throughout the Army; (4) provide feedback to Army and joint or combined participants; and (5) provide a means of improving doctrine, training,  leader  development,  organization,  and  materials  to  enable soldiers to win in combat.

The rationale behind the CTC program is a simple one. Green troops and leaders make mistakes, particularly in their first engagement. Through realistic exercises that are more challenging than most actual combat, the Army seeks to leap ahead of the learning curve by fielding well-seasoned

units from the outset. Realistic, demanding training serves as bloodless battle, and through such training actual battle loses some of its ability to shock, paralyze, or overwhelm the U.S. soldier.

The  influence  of  the  CTC  program  is  felt  throughout  the  service, in  both the active Army and reserve components. In FY 1999, the Army National Guard (ARNG) sent 11 percent of its force-40,000 out of 357,469 personnel-through  various  CTC  programs.  Fort  Irwin  hosted  14,300 ARNG members from more than twenty-five states for NTC exercises. At the CMTC, 1,900 Guardsmen participated in battalion-level exercises. Fort Polk hosted 7,750 ARNG personnel for live-fire and force-on-force brigade exercises at the JRTC. Fully 15,000 Guard personnel attended one of the four training programs at Fort Leavenworth' s CAC. Participation rates for the active component' s 479,426 personnel are even higher, with each active Army battalion expected to rotate through the NTC or JRTC during each commander's tour.

The apex role of CTC maneuvers in unit training is made clear in the training strategy for the ARNG's enhanced separate brigades. A four-year program is considered the base for all Guard units. Most of those units do not systematically participate in CTC maneuvers, but the enhanced separate brigades have a higher priority for both equipment and training. In  these  brigades,  two  aligned  four-year  programs  provide  an  eightyear training cycle. The first year focuses on crew, squad, and platoon proficiency. In the following year, the training emphasis moves up to the platoon and company levels, and then to the company and battalion task force in the third year.  The fourth year of the sequence develops companythrough brigade-level operations. For enhanced separate brigades, years five  through  seven  of  the  sequence  replicate  years  one  through  three, culminating during year eight in a live-fire rotation at either the NTC or JRTC that marks the pinnacle of their training cycle.

The NTC hosts ten training rotations each year-nine for active Army brigades and one for a National Guard enhanced separate brigade. But the  realism  of  NTC  exercises  has  suffered  from  improved  capabilities and changing doctrine. When the NTC was established in 1981, Army brigades engaged hostile forces at ranges of one to twelve miles. Current weapons systems can fire on enemy targets sixty miles away. The pace of tactical operations has more than doubled in the intervening years, from ten to more than twenty-five miles per hour. The exercise area at Fort Irwin is no longer large enough to permit entirely realistic brigade-sized exercises. As a result, during 1999 the Army maintained its efforts to procure 174,461 additional acres bordering the facility. Environmental concerns over the safety of the desert tortoise and the Lane Mountain milkvetch,  two  endangered  species  found  on  Fort  Irwin,  continued  to disrupt the planned expansion of the NTC during FY 1999.

The NTC still hosted its scheduled annual rotation of ten brigades. Five three-battalion,  heavy-light  task  forces;  three  three-battalion  light-heavy task forces; and one two-battalion task force from the active Army engaged the opposing force of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Irwin. One National Guard enhanced separate brigade also completed a training rotation in the California desert. One Guard enhanced separate brigade and seven three-battalion, task force-size brigades from the active Army rotated through  the  Fort  Polk  JRTC  facilities.  A  ninth  scheduled  rotation  there enabled the 75th Ranger Regiment to practice large-scale operations.

The other CTC locations made their own contributions to the Army' s combat readiness during FY 1999. In Hohenfels, the CMTC conducted two mission-readiness exercises in support of continuing operations in Kosovo. The site also hosted five three-battalion brigades and one two-battalion, light-heavy task forces for their CTC rotations. At Fort Leavenworth, the Combined  Arms  Center's  Battle  Command  Training  Program  (BCTP) continued to prepare field grade and senior officers for the challenges of warfare. The BCTP directed two corps-level exercises, seven divisional exercises,  and  eight  joint  task  force  exercises.  In  addition,  the  National Guard rotated twelve brigade staffs  through  battle  command  and  battle staff training exercises at the CAC during FY 1999.

CAC rotations, however, are only one aspect of the Army' s continuous effort to  train  its  personnel.  The  Combined  Arms  Training  Strategy  establishes the requirements for unit, soldier, and leader training in both the active and reserve components. Battle-focused training management software assists commanders from company through brigade levels in creating unit mission statements  and  identifying  crucial  tasks  for  unit-level  training.  To  meet those needs, Tiger XXI, the simulation in training for advanced readiness computer program, enables heavy units to combine live and virtual training at the battalion staff, company, and platoon levels. The Tiger XXI software became the ARNG's primary unit training program in FY 1999.

The Army continues to organize and participate in exercises around the world to complement unit training and CTC rotations. These exercises differ widely in their scale and format. Local exercises, such as the elevenday Lightning Thrust Bronco that placed the 3d Brigade Combat Team in a simulated peace enforcement operation, test unit skills and give soldiers the opportunity to develop their abilities in a complex and realistic environment. At the other extreme, international combined arms exercises like Tandem Thrust 99 test and develop the Army's ability to operate with the other American armed services and allied forces. For Tandem Thrust, the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, and the 45th Corps Support Group deployed to Guam and the Mariana Islands. There the two units joined other elements of the U.S. Pacific Command and allied contingents from Australia and Canada for a command post and field exercise. Tandem Thrust involved

twelve thousand personnel, eighteen ships, and 110 aircraft from the three nations  in  the  largest  joint-combined  military  exercise  ever  held  in  the Western Pacific region.

Exercises  do  not  have  to  involve  entire  field  units  or  even  address the threat of combat to contribute to the Army' s mission performance. In FY 1999, six  defense  coordinating  officers  and  their  staffs-four  from First Army and two from Fifth Army-joined National Guard personnel and  representatives  from  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency (FEMA) and other federal and local government offices to practice disaster preparedness in STAFFEX 99. Defense coordinating officers work with FEMA and other agencies  to  meet  domestic  crises.  For  STAFFEX  99, an  earthquake  north  of  Memphis, Tennessee,  a  disaster  four  times  the magnitude  of  1992' s  Hurricane  Andrew,  provided  the  simulated  crisis confronting the nearly two hundred participants.

Operational  deployments  themselves  have  the  welcome  benefit  of providing or encouraging additional training. And some operations, like FY 1999's new horiZons, combine both training exercise and operational mission in a single package. In the case of new horiZons, a scheduled annual training exercise expanded into a humanitarian relief mission in the wake of hurricanes Mitch and Georges. Stricken populations received badly  needed  assistance,  and  participating  U.S.  personnel  were  able  to develop and use their skills in an operational setting.

## Deployed Operational Forces

In  FY  1999,  the Army  engaged  in  operational  deployments  across the  mission  spectrum. At  home and abroad, Army personnel undertook humanitarian support, disaster relief, law enforcement, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement missions in support of the National Military Strategy. On  an  average  day  in  FY  1999,  the Army  had  approximately  109,000 forward-stationed  personnel  and  31,000  soldiers  operationally  deployed in  more  than  sixty  countries.  These  numbers  fluctuated  in  response  to global events. On 26 August 1999, for example, fulfillment of the Army' s missions required the operational deployment of 27,397 soldiers-22,748 active Army, 2,701 ARNG, and 1,948 U.S. Army Reserve (USAR)-in eighty-one countries.

To meet the challenges of such widespread, large-scale commitments, the Army continued to draw on the reserve components to provide essential support and services to forces deployed in contingency and peacekeeping operations around the world. With ten active and eight reserve-component divisions, the Army was able to meet its mission requirements, but doing so  placed  heavy  demands  on  some  units.  This  is  an  understandable consequence  of  the  number  of  annual  deployments  having  more  than

tripled  since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  when  the Army  fielded  eighteen active and ten reserve-component divisions.

The Army carefully tracks the amount of time each unit spends on outof-station operational deployments. The deployment tempo (DEPTEMPO) is a count of every day the unit is deployed away from home, simply defined as each day the soldiers do not sleep in their own bunks. The DEPTEMPO is subdivided into four categories: local training, off-installation training, joint exercises, and contingency operation participation. The chief of staff, Army (CSA), established an annual DEPTEMPO goal of 120 days per unit  when  the Army  began  monitoring  the  DEPTEMPO  in  1997.  Unit DEPTEMPOs exceeding 180 days must be approved by the CSA. In FY 1999, the Army tracked the DEPTEMPO for 1,462 reporting units. A total of 126 units (8.6 percent of the total reporting), exceeded the 120-day goal. The DEPTEMPO for fifty-four units (3.7 percent of those reporting) passed the 180-day mark. Those fifty-four units included eighteen in Bosnia, two in the Sinai, and one in Saudi Arabia.

The  training  and  operational  commitments  of  the  reduced  Army increase the personal demands placed on military and civilian personnel. Some units bear more of a burden than others because of their special skills. A list of the specialties most often deployed in FY 1999 appears in Table 15.

The Army tries to minimize the impact of a high DEPTEMPO on units and soldiers. Individual units are rotated through contingency operations rather than remaining deployed until the operation concludes.

Units deployed for a given mission are selected from throughout the Army to prevent forces in any one region from becoming overburdened. Army  civilians  and  contractors  are  used,  where  appropriate,  to  relieve the  strain  on  uniformed  personnel.  Reserve-component  units  routinely augment deployed active Army forces and reduce overall DEPTEMPOs, particularly in critical support functions. During FY 1999, the National Guard and Army Reserve deployed 8,628 uniformed personnel, in 344 units, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina area of operations. There they performed a  variety  of  missions,  including  those  within  the  following  functional areas:  civil  affairs,  psychological  operations,  public  affairs,  firefighting, military history, rear-area operations, fire support, light infantry, aviation, logistics, military police, medical service, and maintenance. In Kosovo, an additional 211 soldiers, from 27 reserve units, executed civil affairs, reararea operations, medical public affairs, and maintenance missions.

To  aid  the  individual  soldier  in  dealing  with  operational  demands, the Army has a policy to stabilize soldiers' domestic lives on their return from deployment. If they have been deployed for at least thirty consecutive days, soldiers are granted a period of uninterrupted home duty when the deployment concludes. Army policy provides for one month of duty at the soldier' s permanent station for each month of temporary duty or temporary change of station. To the maximum extent possible, soldiers within that stabilization window will not be redeployed.

Army personnel are deployed for a wide variety of purposes, including disaster relief. The ARNG remains the nation' s primary contingency force for wide-scale domestic disturbance or natural disaster, a role it was called to fulfill several times in FY 1999. In fact, the fiscal year had not even begun when the first natural disaster struck, a disaster that would occupy the Guard for most of the year. During the period 15-29 September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck seventeen Caribbean islands and affected the lives  of  more  than  thirty  million  people. The  tropical  storm  swept  over island after island in the northern Caribbean, killing at least four hundred people  and  causing  damage  amounting  to  billions  of  dollars.  In  some instances,  as  with  the  small  island  of  St.  Kitts,  Georges  destroyed  the crucial winter tourist season and the sugar crop, thus devastating the local economy. Many residents were left homeless by the storm: more than one hundred thousand in the Dominican Republic, at least eighteen thousand in Haiti, more than seventeen thousand in Puerto Rico, and three thousand (10 percent of the population) on St. Kitts.

Georges also struck directly at the U.S. mainland. Making landfall on 28 September between Biloxi and Pascagoula, Mississippi, the hurricane drove  nine  thousand  people  into  emergency  shelters  and  left  230,000 people without  power. Waves  up  to  twenty-five  feet  high  and  winds  of eighty-five miles per hour struck the Alabama coast, forcing the mandatory

evacuation of two Alabama counties. Emergency shelters cared for 4,675 people driven from their homes, while 177,000 people were left without electricity. Louisiana recorded two storm-related deaths and power outages affecting  260,000  people.  New  Orleans' s  Superdome  stadium  provided emergency shelter for fourteen thousand people. Florida experienced the worst  disruptions.  State  authorities  issued  evacuation  orders  affecting 1.4  million  people  throughout  the  state. Two  people  were  killed  by  the storm. The Florida Keys and at least 150,000 people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale regions were left without electricity. Six hundred Florida National  Guard  personnel  deployed  to  impose  a  nighttime  curfew  in stricken areas of the state.

National Guard units in all the affected states responded to the crisis immediately in their state capacity, and the Army launched federal relief operations  as  the  new  fiscal  year  began.  Within  the  continental  United States  and  in  the  Caribbean  basin,  food,  water,  ice,  medical  supplies, and personnel from all branches of the armed forces began to flow to the devastated islands and coastal communities. The effort was not a month old, however, when disaster struck again. Hurricane Georges had proven unusually persistent throughout its life cycle as a tropical storm. Hurricane Mitch  proved  to  be  unusually  powerful.  Sustained  winds  in  excess  of 180 miles per hour earned Mitch a rating as a category five hurricane, the fourth most powerful hurricane ever recorded. At its peak for some thirty-three  hours  on  26/27  October,  Mitch  passed  through  the  western Caribbean before stalling off the coast of Honduras. By 2 November, at least ten thousand people had died in floods and mudslides across Central America. More than two million residents were left homeless in the wake of  the  storm.  Mitch  crossed  the  Caribbean,  and  the  track  of  Georges, to  strike  southern  Florida  early  on  5  November  before  passing  into  the Atlantic and losing strength. Damage from the second great storm of the 1998 hurricane season exceeded eight billion dollars.

The U.S. Army again rose to the challenge. Under the direction of the  commander  in  chief  of  U.S.  Southern  Command,  Operation  new horiZons,  a  scheduled  training  exercise,  quickly  expanded  into  what President  Clinton  called  'the  largest  humanitarian  assistance  mission since the Berlin Airlift.' Beginning in January 1999, one new joint task force  would  be  launched  every  thirty  to  sixty  days.  At  the  operation' s peak, four ARNG battalion-plus-size task forces and a forward command element, totaling more than two thousand Guard members, were involved in the region. When the operation concluded on 4 August 1999, a total of 20,800 reserve-component personnel had participated in new horiZons, accompanied by personnel from the active Army and the other services. National  Guardsmen built  three  medical  clinics,  four  schools,  and  four wells in Honduras. ARNG engineer units also repaired an important bridge

and fifteen miles of damaged highway. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent two hundred personnel, accompanied by 224 U.S. Marines, to help replace the ninety-three additional bridges destroyed in Honduras alone.

FY 1999 brought other humanitarian challenges to the Army. Tension in  Yugoslavia  between  Serbs  and  ethnic  Albanians  in  the  province  of Kosovo resulted in a growing refugee problem in the Balkans by March 1999. To assist the Republic of Macedonia in dealing with the influx of displaced  people,  the  United  States  agreed  to  accept  twenty  thousand refugees from Kosovo in the spring of that year. The U.S. Army Reserve Command  (USARC)  at  Fort  McPherson,  Georgia,  assumed  command of Operation proviDe reFuge and in early April selected Fort Dix, New Jersey, to host the Kosovar refugees. The USARC chose the Fort Dix Army Reserve installation partly because of the facility' s historical success as a power-projection center, able to expand and adapt rapidly to new demands. Responding  to  the  challenge,  the  Fort  Dix  garrison  received  prompt reinforcements from other Reserve formations and active Army soldiers from the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. With the influx of new personnel, Fort Dix quickly converted from garrison routine to full mobilization. For example, the company-size dining facility expanded to four battalion- and three company-size facilities. On the morning of 6 May, the first 447 refugees landed at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, and proceeded to their temporary quarters at Fort Dix. Between 6 May and 9 July, the installation processed 4,025 refugees, more than a quarter of the 13,989 Kosovars admitted to the United States during this time.

Unfortunately, the Yugoslavian conflict could not be resolved solely  through  humanitarian  assistance  to  refugees. Acting  through  the North Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO),  the  United  States  and  its allies  launched  Operation  ALLIED  FORCE  to  disrupt  the  forces  that Yugoslavia's president Slobodan Milosevic was using against the Albanian civilian  majority  in  Kosovo.  NATO  air  strikes  began  on  24  March  and continued until 10 June 1999. On that day, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 formally authorized a peacekeeping force, confirming the agreement reached by NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 9 June. Beginning on 11 June, the United States maintained approximately seven thousand personnel in the Kosovo Force that was executing the NATO peacekeeping mission, Operation Joint guarDian. President Clinton soon mobilized Army Reserve personnel  to  support  Joint  guarDian  under  a presidential selected reserve call-up.

As  the  two  hundred  reservists  mobilized  by  the  president' s  order arrived  in  Germany  to  fill  positions  vacated  by  active Army  personnel deployed to Kosovo, they encountered other Reserve personnel supporting another Balkans mission. Operation Joint Forge, begun in FY 1998, is the  continuing  NATO-led  Stabilization  Force  peacekeeping  mission  in

Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In  Germany,  Bosnia,  and  Hungary,  twenty-three hundred Army reservists supported the sixty-nine hundred U.S. personnel of Joint Forge during FY 1999.

Army personnel continued to provide support for Operations northern watCh and southern watCh, enforcing the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. U.S. and British aircraft attacked that nation during December 1999 in Operation Desert Fox, an effort to compel Iraq to comply with the arms inspection requirements agreed to at the end of the Gulf War. The Army provided support for the raids as part of a combined joint operation under the U.S. Central Command.

The Army sustained its support of domestic security by participating in counterdrug activities as mandated in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1989. More than three thousand soldiers from both the active and reserve components assisted federal, state, and local drug law enforcement agencies  (DLEAs)  during  FY  1999.  Other  Army  assistance  activities included operational support, facilities, maintenance, intelligence analysis, linguistic  support,  engineer  support,  equipment,  training,  and  planning assistance. To facilitate such cooperation, 338 soldiers and Department of the Army civilians were assigned to various counterdrug joint task forces. The majority of the training support requested by the DLEAs during FY 1999 was provided by the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), the National Guard Regional Counterdrug  Training Academy, the Multijurisdictional  Counterdrug Task  Force Training Academy,  and  the National Interagency Counterdrug Institute. The DLEAs also commonly requested  training  from  the  U.S.  Army  Military  Police  School  and instruction on intelligence preparation of the battlefield.

The  Army Reserve deployed 565 personnel to complete 115 counterdrug support missions in FY 1999.  USAR activities ranged from constructing  roads  and  fences  along  the  Mexican  border  to  providing intelligence analysts and linguists to foreign and domestic DLEAs. The Army National Guard assigned twenty-five hundred to thirty-five hundred personnel each week to support operations that included aerial and ground reconnaissance, road and fence construction, other engineering projects, marijuana eradication, cargo inspection at ports of entry, transportation, translation,  intelligence  analysis,  and  drug  demand  reduction  support activities.  In  the  active Army,  the  10th  Mountain  Division  and  the  82d Airborne Division provided aerial reconnaissance along the southwestern border. The  3d  Infantry  Division  provided  aviation  support  to  the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and local authorities in the Bahamas, while other units rendered similar assistance elsewhere.

The active Army and the reserve components devoted considerable aviation and other equipment to the counterdrug mission, including the loan of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft to the U.S. Customs Service. The

Army loaned, leased, or transferred more than $50 million in equipment to federal, state, and local DLEAs in FY 1999. In addition to OH-58 and UH-1H helicopters, this equipment included weapons, night vision gear, and communications and electronic equipment.

## Army Special Operations Forces

The U.S. Army Special Operations Command  (USASOC)  is responsible  for  the  planning  and  execution  of  unconventional  warfare, foreign  internal  defense,  special  reconnaissance,  and  direct  actions  in support of U.S. strategy. Traditionally associated with the Special Forces, or Green Beret and Ranger formations, Army special operations forces also include the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and psychological operations, civil affairs, signal, and combat service support units. The last two functions are the responsibility of the 112th Special Operations Signal Battalion (Airborne) and the 528th Special Operations Support Battalion (Airborne), respectively.

Ground combat elements of Army special operations forces in FY 1999 included seven Special Forces Groups (five in the active Army and two in the ARNG) and the 75th Ranger Regiment. Civil affairs units are primarily USAR formations. The 96th Civil Affairs Battalion was the only active component unit  in  FY  1999,  supplemented  by  four  USAR  civil  affairs commands containing twenty-four battalions in eight brigades. Similarly, the  active Army' s  one  psychological  operations  (PSYOP)  group  of  five battalions was distinctly outnumbered by the USAR' s contribution of eight battalions organized into two PSYOP groups.

In  training  special  operations  units,  the  USASOC  recognizes  four truths  about  special  operations.  First,  humans  are  more  important than hardware. It is the quality and training of special forces personnel rather than technical superiority that gives them their unique capabilities. Second, quality is better than quantity. Special operations forces are almost always outnumbered. Their military effectiveness arises from superior personnel and superb training, two keys to success that cannot readily be replaced or  improved  by  mere  numbers.  Because  of  their  reliance  on  carefully selected and thoroughly trained personnel, special operations forces are subject to a third truth: They cannot be mass produced. Even the elite few who possess the aptitudes and qualities of a special operations soldier need to complete lengthy training programs to be effective. Arising out of  the  need  for  such  carefully  selected,  highly  trained  personnel  is  the fourth  truth  of  special  operations  forces: They  cannot  be  created  after emergencies occur.

Special operations forces are called to a variety of missions. In FY 1999 1st, 3d, and 5th Special Forces Groups, in conjunction with the U.S. Army

Military  Police  School,  trained  1,778  DLEA  personnel.  Civil  affairs  and psychological operations units, largely from the Army Reserve, conducted operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Special operations units participated in joint,  multinational,  and  unilateral  exercises,  in  addition  to  the  Combat Training  Center  program.  A  total  of  33,912  Special  Forces  personnel deployed to 120 countries on operations and training exercises in FY 1999.

## Military Intelligence

The  success  of  special  operations,  precision  strikes,  and  virtually every other military mission depends on accurate and timely intelligence. The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) provides national- to tactical-level information connectivity and intelligence support to Army commanders. In FY 1999, the INSCOM emphasized information systems  in  the  effort  to  build  the  capabilities  necessary  to  support  the intelligence requirements of Force XXI while developing AAN initiatives. It is not surprising that the effort is named Intel XXI. At the end of FY 1999, the INSCOM identified several projects for further development. These projects included Trojan Classic, a system providing tactical and strategic  intelligence  to  the  leaders  of  the  Army' s  major  commands. Trojan Classic also is intended to assist in maintaining and developing the signals intelligence skills of intelligence personnel while helping build and maintain threat databases.

All such systems within the Department of Defense are being developed to  create  a  unified  system-of-systems  approach  to  U.S.  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. The resulting smooth flow of information between sensors, commanders, and soldiers will enable U.S., allied, and coalition forces to strike rapidly and decisively at extended ranges and otherwise shape the battlefield. The Airborne Reconnaissance Architecture,  the  Future  Imagery Architecture,  the  Integrated  Overhead Signal  Intelligence Architecture,  and  the  Space-Based  Infrared  System are  efforts  directed  toward  that  goal,  developing  interoperable  digitized intelligence systems. Force XXI and AAN will enjoy an ISR strategy that integrates imagery, signals, and measurement and signatures intelligence into a single intelligence picture.

The Army's increasing reliance on computers and network-based information brings with it the possibility of external penetration for the purpose of espionage or sabotage. To meet that threat the Army initiated a study for the CSA on the viability of an institutionalized Information Technology/Information Assurance Corps. Although not affiliated with the INSCOM, the Army's existing information assurance program does include  a  counterintelligence  mission  similar  to  that  anticipated  for part of the proposed corps. In FY 1999, the Army acquired more than

five hundred intrusion detection systems and several hundred gateway and Internet Protocol blocking technologies to help secure information systems.

## Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Issues

The threat of weapons of mass destruction did not fade away with the  end  of  the  Cold War,  and  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  (NBC) issues retained their decades-old prominence in the Army of FY 1999. Protecting  Army  personnel  from  accidental  or  deliberate  exposure  to dangerous  radiation,  biological  threats,  and  hazardous  chemicals  has become  a  routine  concern.  The  federal  government  meets  the  broad spectrum of NBC threats at all levels, from laws and regulations governing the handling of hazardous materials to training for NBC warfare.

In  FY  1999,  the  DOD  focused  on  a  threat  from  the  middle  of  the spectrumbacillus  anthracis, the  anthrax  bacterium.  At  least  seven nations, including Iraq, possessed anthrax weapons in FY 1999.  The disease is the simplest and most common bacterial agent employed in biological weapons. Left untreated, the inhaled form of anthrax has a fatality rate that can approach 99 percent.  Although heavy doses of antibiotics administered immediately after exposure may defeat the disease, treatment for inhalation anthrax postponed until symptoms occur is far less effective. The fatality rate for patients treated after becoming symptomatic is near 80 percent. With that in mind, the DOD began vaccinating all uniformed personnel against anthrax in March 1998.

The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved  the  anthrax  vaccine for  human  use  in  1970. A  full  human  vaccination  requires  six  doses over eighteen months, with annual boosters thereafter. Reports of mild reactions to the injection have persisted since its introduction, but severe reactions  occur  less  than  once  per  one  hundred  thousand  doses,  and reactions requiring hospitalization occur less than once per two hundred thousand  doses.  No  long-term  side  effects  or  fatalities  have  been associated with the vaccine. In exchange for what is most commonly a  minimal  or  nonexistent  reaction,  those  people  vaccinated  appear  to receive significant protection against the disease. A substantial body of scientific evidence derived from animal experiments and studies of people working with imported animal hair, and thus occasionally exposed to the disease, demonstrate that the vaccine is effective. It provided the best long-term, large-scale protection against anthrax available in 1999.

Despite  the  obvious  drawbacks  of  protective  garments  or  postexposure  medication  as  alternatives  to  immunization,  controversy over the need for the DOD's vaccination order and what some people perceived  as  a  high  risk  of  adverse  reactions  mounted  in  FY  1999.

Lack of public knowledge about anthrax and vaccination procedures fueled the debate, complicated by a flood of misinformation appearing on the Internet and rumors that administration of the vaccine to military personnel during the Gulf War was in some way related to later health problems. As a result of the confusion, some Army personnel refused the vaccination order.

As of 6 October 1998, just five days into FY 1999, the  Army had given the first  shot  in  the  six-shot  series  to  more  than  thirty-seven  thousand personnel.  An additional fifty-six hundred soldiers had received the fourth shot by that date. Eight soldiers had refused to obey the order to receive the vaccination, the beginning of a disturbing trend. Disposition of those soldiers,  through  nonjudicial  punishment,  administrative  discharge,  or other means, remained an open question as the vaccinations continued. By the end of FY 1999, the Army had announced no clear policy for the specific offense of refusing anthrax vaccination. Local commanders were left to apply the Uniform Code of Military Justice and guidance in the Manual for Courts-Martial and Army regulations to the general case  of  refusal  to  obey  a  lawful  order.  Most  transgressors  received administrative discharges or nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code.

The Army made its greatest strides in protection against the threat of  NBC weapons in FY 1999 by creating special units to combat the relatively new threat of terrorists employing weapons of mass destruction. In response to the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, the secretary of the  Army established the Consequence Management Program  Integration  Office  (COMPIO)  in  January  1998.  That  office developed the concept for a new National Guard formation, the Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team (WMD-CST). The first ten units of that formation became operational in FY 1999, with each state slated to receive one by FY 2003. The Army Reserve, in conjunction with the COMPIO, began fielding and training chemical defense companies with specialized hazardous materials response equipment and mass casualty decontamination equipment.

The WMD-CST units are composed of twenty-two full-time National Guard personnel of diverse specialties. In the case of a suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological (release of radiation without nuclear detonation) event, the local WMD-CST unit would immediately assess the incident and begin providing expert advice to civilian agencies. As the incident response proceeded, the team's role would shift to providing the interface between civil and military responders required for effective cooperation. Through the new National Guard units and the upgraded Army Reserve companies, the Army is much better prepared to face the changing NBC threat.

## The Army in Space

The danger posed by weapons of mass destruction is intimately linked with  their  most  prominent  means  of  delivery.  In  FY  1999,  the  Army continued to maintain and develop systems to detect, warn against, and intercept ballistic and cruise missiles. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) is responsible for the  Army's activities relating to  the  military  threats  and  advantages  associated  with  spacefaring. The SMDC directs the activities of Army Space Command as a subordinate command  and  the  Space  and  Missile  Defense  Acquisition  Center,  the Space and Missile Defense Battle  Lab,  the  Space  and  Missile  Defense Technology Center, the Force Development and Integration Center, and the Army  Space  Program  Office  as  subordinate  elements.  For  a  major Army command, the SMDC remains quite small in scale. In FY 1999, it consisted of only 606 military and 1,029 civilian personnel.

But the  SMDC plays a larger role in national defense than its  size indicates. The  DOD  has  designated  it  as  the  leading  proponent  for  the ground-based elements of national missile defense. It is also charged with developing a theater missile defense for the Army and integrating both weapons  systems  and  space-related  capabilities  into  the  service  as  the Army's designated proponent for space. The importance of theater missile defense was apparent at the beginning of FY 1999, as U.S. policy grappled with  recent  nuclear  tests  in  India  and  Pakistan  and  the  development  of longer-range missiles by  Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan.

Through the SMDC, the Army improved the nation's ability to defend against  such  missile  threats.  The  first  demonstration  of  the  National Missile  Defense  program's  hit-to-kill  ability  against  intercontinental ballistic  missiles  was  scheduled  to  occur  during  FY  1999.  Program delays forced postponement of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle test until early October 1999, after the end of the fiscal year. Other missile defense programs  made  more  obvious  progress.  Continued  development  and testing  of  the  Patriot Advanced  Capability-3  (PAC-3)  missile,  with  the ability to intercept targets at twice the range of earlier versions, expanded the Army's theater ballistic missile defense capabilities in FY 1999. The Theater  High-Altitude  Area  Defense  (THAAD)  program,  intended  to supplement  the  advanced  Patriot  missile  by  extending  theater  defense capabilities to higher altitudes and fielding the first interceptor specifically designed to defend against theater ballistic missiles, advanced the Army' s defensive capabilities. The THAAD achieved two successful intercepts in FY99 testing. Both the PAC-3 and THAAD intercepts were hit-to-kill, with the interceptors physically striking their targets. The Army' s success in what has been called 'hitting a bullet with a bullet' demonstrated the effectiveness of the hit-to-kill technology.

But  not  all  missiles  approach  their  targets  on  ballistic  trajectories. Cruise missiles are a difficult target for air defense systems because of their small size and low altitude, which combine to limit detection ranges and response times. One solution to that problem is the modification of an existing forward air defense system developed by the Army Materiel Command's Aviation and Missile Command-the Avenger, which places eight  turret-mounted Stinger missiles on a high-mobility, multipurpose, wheeled vehicle.  In  early  1999,  the Army  exercised  an  option  to  begin procuring an upgrade kit for the Avenger. The upgrade will provide 'slewto-cue' capability, directing the modified platform toward a target before its onboard fire-control system even detects the target. An electronic link with other sensors will provide the necessary information and shave precious seconds from Avenger's response time. By harnessing information network technology,  the  slew-to-cue  upgrade  will  increase  the Army' s  ability  to provide theater defense against cruise missiles.

The SMDC made significant progress in an innovative cruise missile defense system during FY 1999. The Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) is a tethered aerostat equipped with a sensor array that enables it to see over the horizon, unlike land- or sea-based radar. It can thus detect low-flying cruise missiles much earlier than can other sensor systems. In exercises conducted in March, the JLENS for the first time provided a link between an offshore Navy Aegis cruiser and a land-based Patriot air defense system located at Fort Stewart, Georgia. The Army Acquisition Executive approved the JLENS for an acquisition category II program later that month. During the roving sanDs '99 training exercise, the JLENS successfully tracked multiple lowaltitude targets at a range of two hundred miles.

Truly space-based technologies are becoming ever more important as the services digitize, providing crucial communications links and support for intelligence, navigation, and missile early-warning systems.  The SMDC established  the  Force  Development and Integration Center in FY 1997. The center addresses a mission given to the SMDC without corresponding resources: the integration into broader planning and development activities of  doctrine,  training,  leadership  development,  organizational,  materiel, and personnel functions related to space systems, national missile defense, and theater missile defense. The center' s efforts produced several notable achievements  during  the  fiscal  year,  including  the  Army' s  May  1999 announcement  of  the  selection  of  the  first  officers  designated  as  space operations  officers.  Officers  designated  in  that  field  assist  in  managing and planning space capabilities and in integrating them into the Army. The center  also  drafted  the Army' s Theater Air  and  Missile  Defense  Master Plan and initiated the Army Space Mix Study to investigate potential space capabilities for the Army in the coming century.

In  FY  1999,  there  were  several  other  developments  in  the  Army' s pursuit of space capabilities. The Office of the National Missile Defense TRADOC System Manager was created and chartered in the fourth quarter of FY 1999 as a subordinate element of the SMDC. Its charter authorized the office to act as the  Army' s representative, manager, and integrator for the entire spectrum of doctrine, training, leader development, organizational, materiel,  and  soldier  products  associated  with  the  land-based  National Missile Defense system. And the SMDC Battle Lab's iridium telephone system  became  fully  operational  in  November  1998.  Supported  by  a constellation of seventy satellites, it is a truly global telephone system that improves the Army's communications capabilities anywhere in the world.

## 5 Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

The armed  services have increasingly called on their reserve components to support both contingencies and routine military operations in  recent  years  as  a  result  of  Secretary  of  Defense  Les  Aspin' s  1993 Bottom-Up  Review  process.  Reforms  initiated  in  the  wake  of  the Bottom-Up Review reduced the size of the armed services and increased the  role  of  the  reserve  components  within  them  even  as  the  end  of  the international  stability  imposed  by  the  Cold  War  expanded  the  demand for U.S. peacekeeping, peace enforcement, training, and routine support deployments. The remaining active-component forces cannot sustain the resulting tempo of operations without augmentation and support. Reservecomponent forces provide that support, binding the service components together and sharing the institutional and personal burdens of deployment. Across  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD),  reserve-component  forces provided 12.5 million man-days of service in FY 1999, roughly double the amount of such support provided only five years earlier. Clearly, the reserve components are an increasingly vital element of the U.S. armed services.

When required, the Army National Guard (ARNG) and Army Reserve (USAR) supply proficient units and skilled individual soldiers to support the operations of the active Army. Guard and Reserve formations ensure that the Army retains capabilities not ordinarily needed in time of peace while  reducing  the  cost  of  maintaining  those  capabilities  in  the  active Army. Restructuring efforts in the mid-1990s struck a new balance among the Guard, Reserve, and active Army to ensure that the entire force remains cohesive and interoperable.

Contingency  planning  now  anticipates  the  involvement  of  reservecomponent units from the beginning of operations, an aspect of the National Military  Strategy  intended  to  continue  into  the  objective  force-the Army After Next. High-priority Guard and Reserve units furnish needed capabilities to Army forces responding early in a contingency mission. As an operation matures, a growing proportion of the forces involved come

from  the  reserve  components,  replacing  deployed  active-Army  units, providing support, and furnishing vital skills. This enables the active Army to avoid exhaustion and preserve its ability to respond to other crises.

The  Reserve  Forces  Policy  Board  guarantees  that  members  of  the National  Guard  and  the  Army  Reserve  receive  adequate  training  and equipment to  play  those  roles  and  smoothly  integrate  with  active-force units. Operating at the DOD level, the board champions the interests of reservists in all branches of military service. In FY 1999, the board' s top priorities  were  fairness  of  pay  and  benefits,  equipment  appropriations, opening  to  reservists  the  personnel  reliability  program  (which  screens personnel for positions with access to nuclear materials), recruiting and retention,  tax  incentives  for  employers,  and  elevating  the  directors  and chiefs of reserve components from two- to three-star rank.

Under terms of an agreement announced by Secretary Aspin in 1993, the Army Reserve is oriented toward combat service support functions, some of which are also found in the National Guard. In FY 1999, the Army Reserve provided 45 percent of the Army's combat service support units and 26 percent of its combat support units. These organizations included all  of  the  Army' s  individual  and  collective  training  support  divisions and railway units,  97  percent  of  its  civil  affairs  units,  84  percent  of  its psychological  operations  units,  70  percent  of  its  medical  units,  and  62 percent of its chemical and biological defense capability.

Under the  same  agreement,  the Army  National  Guard  provides  the combat reserve of the U.S. Army while executing its traditional functions of disaster relief and emergency preparedness at the state level. Much of that combat reserve resides in the fifteen enhanced separate brigades of the  Army  National  Guard.  Defined  as  brigades  with  increased  priority for  personnel, equipment, and funding, those formations are capable of operating independently or as part of active-Army divisions. The Guard also provides one armored, two mechanized, one light infantry, and four infantry divisions to the  Army' s total capability, in addition to other combat, combat support, and combat service support units.

Soldiers in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard are assigned to one of three manpower management categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, and the Retired Reserve. The Ready Reserve, the largest of the three categories, is further subdivided. Most members of the Ready Reserve form the federally recognized units of the Selected Reserve, a subcategory that also includes individual personnel serving in the activeduty Guard and Reserve. In the Army Reserve, the Selected Reserve also includes  individual  mobilization  augmentees,  skilled  soldiers  ready  to join and support active-Army units when needed. Subject to involuntary recall  as  part  of  the  Ready  Reserve  are  former  active-duty or Selected Reserve  personnel  remaining  in  the  Individual  Ready  Reserve  (IRR).

An additional component of the Ready Reserve, the inactive National Guard,  consists  of  personnel  attached  to  a  specific  reserve  unit  who are  not  required  to  train  regularly  but  remain  subject  to  mobilization, similar to members of the IRR. The second major personnel category, the Standby Reserve, is not present in the ARNG. It consists of Army reservists designated as key civilian employees or reservists who have a temporary disability or hardship. They may be ordered to active duty in time of war or national emergency if the Ready Reserve lacks sufficient personnel to meet requirements. The Retired Reserve, the last of the three major personnel categories in the reserve structure, comprises individuals who are receiving retirement pay as a result of active duty and reserve service or who have qualified for such pay but have not reached age 60. All retirees with twenty or more years of service remain subject to a call to active duty by the secretary of the Army.

The  FY98  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  created  a  new subcategory  within  the  IRR.  Early  in  the  deployment  cycle,  under  the president' s  selected  reserve  call-up  authority,  the  secretary  of  defense may activate as many as thirty thousand IRR personnel in crucial military occupational specialties that have known shortfalls. Early use of reservists in  such  skill  areas  avoids  widespread  transfers  from  active Army  units scheduled for later deployment. By recognizing members of the IRR in high-demand skill  areas  as  a  special  subset  of  the  Ready  Reserve  and granting the secretary of defense the authority to use them as such, the new legislation  improved  the Army' s  ability  to  support  operations  and sustain readiness.

In  FY  1999,  personnel  in  all  manpower  management  categories totaled 391,049 in the Army Reserve and 362,059 in the Army National Guard. Those figures exceed the official FY99 end strengths of 206,836 USAR personnel and 357,469 ARNG personnel because they include the Retired Reserve. Many reserve-component personnel were assigned to the organized units of their components. The number of such units that the reserve components provided to the Army at the end of FY 1999 is listed in Table 16, identified by category and as a percentage of that type in the total Army.

Army National Guard units report to one of the fifty-four adjutants general of the states-a designation that includes Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia-until mobilized into direct federal service. Those officers are appointed by the various governors or equivalent officials, subject to a federal approval process, and they exercise operational  control  over  Guard  units  performing  their  state  missions. Organized and structured to support mobilization for major conflicts, the Guard attempts to balance its responsibilities for peacetime support, crisis response, emerging missions, and wartime mobilization.

Note: ARNG = Army National Guard, HQ = headquarters, POW = prisoner of war, USAR = U.S. Army Reserve, USARF = U.S. Army Reserve Forces.

In FY 1999, the major changes in the ARNG force structure involved field  artillery,  air  defense  artillery,  and  homeland  defense  units.  The Guard reorganized its self-propelled 155-mm field artillery units to better meet emerging needs. A wide-ranging air defense initiative redistributed resources from divisional batteries to higher priority enhanced separate brigade  batteries.  Acting  in  concert  with  the  Air  National  Guard,  the ARNG activated  the  first Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Civil  Support Teams. These teams, with 80 percent of their personnel gathered from the Army Guard and 20 percent from the Air Guard, respond to chemical, biological, and radiological incidents to facilitate the cooperation of local and federal responders.

The ARNG also pursued reforms intended to enhance its integration with the active component. Redesigning of Guard divisions continued the conversion of the  ARNG combat force structure to a higher percentage of the combat support and combat service support forces that the Army requires to meet the demands of the National Military Strategy. The integrated division program placed six  ARNG combat brigades under the oversight of two active Army  divisions  to  facilitate  the  brigades'  integration  and  deployability. Teaming  four ARNG  divisions  with  their  active  Army  counterparts  for training purposes produced similar results. Creating multicomponent units with elements from the active component, the ARNG, the USAR, and sister services provides theater commanders with ready, integrated, and organized support. These efforts at integrating the Guard and the active component were assisted by assigning several active Army officers to command ARNG units, thereby improving understanding in both components.

Despite  efforts  to  integrate  and  elevate  the  reserve  components to  coequal  status  with  the  active Army  within  the  total  force,  the Army did  not  consistently  maintain  that  focus  during  the  fiscal  year. Thus  the ARNG's FY99 digitization programs were not directly linked to the broader Force XXI reforms. Digitization of the Guard began in FY 1997 with the deployment  of  improved  command-and-control,  communications,  computer, and intelligence systems. But formal integration of those technologies and their  host  units  into  the  Force  XXI  structure  awaited  the  conversion  of the  4th  Infantry  Division  (Mechanized)  to  Division  XXI  design  and  the development of the first digitized corps, III Corps, in FY 2004.

That delay was partially offset in FY 1999 by the activation of the first multicomponent unit in the U.S. Army. The 32d Air and Missile Defense Command, activated during the first quarter of the fiscal year, consists of seventy-seven active-component and 104 National Guard personnel. The active element of the 32d is based at Fort Bliss, Texas, although its reserve personnel are members of the Florida National Guard.  This multicomponent unit initiative is intended to enhance total force integration, improve the resource and readiness posture of Army units, and more efficiently draw on the unique capabilities of each component.

## Strength and Personnel Management

The  Army Reserve's year-end strength actually increased in comparison with that of FY 1998, climbing from 204,968 to 206,836 personnel. This represented  a  change  from  98.5  percent  to  99.4  percent  of  the  static authorized  strength  of  208,000.  The  ARNG  remained  slightly  over  its authorized end strength, declining from 100.3 percent in FY 1998 to 100.1 percent in FY 1999. That FY99 percentage represents 357,469 personnel in a pool authorized at 357,223.

To  achieve  such  a  close  correspondence  between  authorized  and actual  end  strength,  the  National  Guard  closely  monitored  personnel trends and, when it became obvious that non-prior-service enlistments would fall  short  of  the  target,  made  rapid  adjustments  in  its  efforts  to recruit prior-service personnel. Along the way, the Guard improved the overall quality of its non-prior-service accessions, as measured by high school graduation and performance on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT; itself a composite of scores from tests included in the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery). Potential recruits are placed into one of five categories, depending on their percentile rank among all those taking the AFQT. The categories are identified in Table 17, including the routine subdivision of category III.

Although  the  Guard  still  failed  to  meet  the  Army' s  quality  goals, FY99 efforts  brought  recruit  quality  substantially  closer  to  the  targets.

table 17-armeD ForCes qualiFiCation test Categories

| Percentile   | Category   |
|--------------|------------|
| 99-93        | I          |
| 92-65        | II         |
| 64-50        | IIIA       |
| 49-31        | IIIB       |
| 30-10        | IV         |
| 9-1          | V          |

Non-prior-service  recruits  with  high  school  diplomas  increased  by  2.0 percent  over  FY  1998,  to  86.9  percent  of  the  total.  The  improvement almost halved the difference between FY98 figures and the Army's goal of 90 percent. All remaining new accessions obtained high school degrees through general equivalency diploma (GED) testing and similar programs. ARNG accessions from categories I to IIIA of the AFQT attained a level of 60.2 percent in FY 1999, which slightly exceeded the DOD goal of 60 percent. This fell short of the 67 percent goal set by the Department of the Army, but the Guard did finish below the 2 percent ceiling on those scoring  in  category  IV .  Only  1.7  percent  of  new  recruits  scored  in  that lowest acceptable category.

Reductions in the number of junior officers during the force drawdown of  the  mid-1990s  and  competition  from  private  industry  produced  a continuing  shortage  in  company-grade  officers.  To  partially  offset  the shortage, a congressionally mandated Combat Officer Reform Initiative, begun in 1997, authorizes the annual release of 150 lieutenants from their final  twenty-four  to  thirty-six  months  of  active-component  service  to fulfill the rest of their service commitments in an ARNG unit. Despite this successful program, the Guard continues to suffer a shortage of officers. A number of pilot programs have been launched in the Reserve Officer Training Corps and in Officer Candidate School to increase the production of lieutenants in the ARNG, but no conclusions about their effectiveness were reached in FY 1999.

Warrant officer strength in the ARNG was even more problematic. In FY 1999, the Guard possessed only 74.3 percent of its required technical warrant  strength.  Even  warrant  officer  aviator  strength  dipped  below required levels, if only to 99.4 percent. This looming shortage in the ranks of the Guard' s technical experts is a source of concern for an increasingly sophisticated force.

In addition to warrant officers and senior noncommissioned officers, the reserve components draw heavily on the expertise and experience of

full-time support personnel. Uniformed members of the Active Guard and Reserves (AGR) join military technicians (full-time civilian employees of the  reserve  components  subject  to  mobilization  as  uniformed  members of those components as a condition of their employment) to maintain the equipment,  staff  the  offices,  and  perform  the  many  tasks  necessary  to maintain the readiness and deployability of the reserve components. But the full-time support levels that both the ARNG and USAR are authorized to maintain are far below their validated needs. The shortage of full-time support personnel was a major concern for leaders of the National Guard Bureau and Army Reserve during FY 1999.

## Training and Readiness

Members  of  the  active  component  and  the  civil  service  join  AGR personnel and military technicians to meet the reserve components' needs for full-time support. As a group, they organize, administer, recruit, train, and  maintain  reserve  units.  In  FY  1999,  the  USAR  full-time  support personnel  authorization  fell12,895  positions  (37.9  percent)  short  of  the number  required.  ARNG  authorizations  left  18,027  required  positions unfilled (27.5 percent of those needed).

Such  shortages  threaten  force  readiness.  The  increased  operational tempo of reserve  units  and  the  growing  complexity  of  their  equipment demand high levels of maintenance and administrative support. The Guard received some measure of relief from the situation during FY 1999 in the form of an increase in  AGR authorizations for colonels and sergeants major. The  need  for  representation  of  full-time  support  personnel  throughout all  levels  of  command  provided  a  key  argument  in  expanding  those senior-grade  positions. The  expansion  also  offered  needed  promotional opportunities for AGR personnel whose careers were stalled by the lack of adequate grade authorizations.

Reserve  force  readiness  is  an  issue  of  growing  concern. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the operational tempo of reserve units is adversely affecting recruiting and retention at the same time that it strains resources and maintenance capabilities. Within the Army Reserve, the recruitment and retention of health care professionals emerged as a force readiness issue even though the FY99 National Defense Authorization Act approved significant  increases  in  the  health  profession  loan  repayment  program. Despite that authorization, no funds were actually appropriated to ensure the continued financial appeal of USAR service to health care professionals.

Depot maintenance protects the health of the Army' s heavy equipment, just as hospitals protect personnel. When routine maintenance no longer suffices,  heavy  equipment  may  be  sent  to  a  depot  for  a  more  thorough overhaul.  Reserve  forces  lack  a  maintenance  float,  or  pool  of  ready

replacement  equipment,  which  can  temporarily  replace  items  sent  to maintenance  depots.  Units  sending  heavy  elements  into  depots  must, therefore, do without the pieces in question until they passed through a backlog of maintenance tasks. Insufficient funding, including the shortage of full-time support personnel, over previous years left both the USAR and the ARNG with substantial maintenance backlogs in FY 1999. Funding levels  began  to  increase  in  FY  1998  and  continued  to  do  so  in  1999, enabling  depot  personnel  to  begin  reducing  the  accumulated  backlogs. Although still problematic, depot maintenance proved less of a barrier to force readiness in FY 1999 than in the recent past.

In  FY 1997, the Guard introduced the Objective Supply Capability Adaptive Redesign (OSCAR) software. By automating the National Guard Bureau's management of major items and providing an interface with the Standard Army Retail Supply System, OSCAR allows the Guard to identify excess stocks and maximize their availability in all fifty-four states and territories. By the end of FY 1999, OSCAR had significantly improved the equipment readiness of National Guard units, and had identified more than $3.4 billion in excess stocks.

Similar  programs  include  the  European  Excess  Equipment  Project Operation  (EEEPO),  launched  in  FY  1993.  Under  EEEPO,  a  team  of National  Guard  warrant  officers  continues  to  locate  serviceable  and economically  repairable  equipment  and  parts  in  Army  installations in  Europe.  In  1999,  the  EEEPO  team  was  co-located  with  the Army' s Equipment  Maintenance  Center-Europe  in  Kaiserslautern,  Germany. From that location the team can efficiently employ ARNG personnel on overseas deployment training status to repair equipment. When available, such personnel cost $67 less per hour than do Army Materiel CommandEurope contractors. Equipment that those personnel salvage is returned to the United States using space available on National Guard cargo aircraft and is processed in one of five readiness sustainment maintenance sites. Located at Fort Riley (Kansas), Camp Shelby (Mississippi), Limestone (Maine), Saginaw (Texas), and Clackamas (Oregon), these sites complete repairs and distribute the equipment to the Guard. As of the end of the fiscal year, the program had salvaged equipment worth more than $200 million, at a cost of only $8 million.

By  providing  ARNG  units  with  a  source  of  affordable  replacement equipment, the EEEPO helps to ensure force readiness in the equipment and supplies on hand category of DOD' s Global Status of Resources and Training Systems (GOSORTS) unit readiness scale. The equipment and supplies on hand category is one of four readiness categories used in the GOSORTS scale. The  others  are  personnel,  equipment  condition,  and  training.  Each measure is identified by a letter: equipment and supplies on hand status level (S),  personnel  status  level  (P),  equipment  condition  status  level  (R),  and

training status level (T). In combination these measures produce an overall unit resource and training level (C) status rating. The C-level ratings, which represent total capability at mobilization, are defined in Table 18.

table 18-unit reaDiness level at mobiliZation

| C-Level Rating   | Definition                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| C-1              | Can perform full wartime mission    |
| C-2              | Can perform most of wartime mission |
| C-3              | Can perform some of wartime mission |

In  January  1999,  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  warned  Congress  that readiness  was  deteriorating  in  all branches  of  the  armed  services. Despite such warnings and supporting anecdotal evidence, ratings on the GOSORTS scale remained high in FY 1999. Critics of the scale, which was developed during the Cold War, contend that it is not sensitive enough to document the strain imposed by numerous peacekeeping missions and other deployments in the post-Cold War era. The 1999 National Defense Authorization Act directed the DOD to improve readiness reporting and make the system more sensitive to the impact of current operations.

Training is a key element of force readiness. When called to perform their missions, reserve-component forces are expected to perform at or near the level of their active Army counterparts. The relative lack of training time in the reserve components makes high-quality training programs vital to the USAR and the ARNG. Annual personnel loss rates of nearly one fifth for the National Guard and one third for the Army Reserve complicate training  demands.  The  departure  of  skilled  and  experienced  personnel causes  shortages  in  specific  military  occupational  specialties  and  thus places further demands on the training system.

To  meet  the  need  for  ongoing  training  and  maximize  the  yield of an average of only thirty-nine training days each year, the reserve components have steadily increased their use of new  training technologies, such as advanced  distributed learning. Accessible wherever  required  and  capable  of  being  tailored  to  meet  individual needs, such computer-based instruction is ideally suited to the needs of  widely  dispersed  Guard  and  Reserve  personnel.  Technological advances in weapons systems training aids and battle simulators also make realistic  training  more  available  to  reserve-component  forces, while  they  save  the  costs,  transportation  time,  and  environmental impact of more frequent field training.

The National Guard stresses realistic,  sustained,  multi-echelon,  and totally integrated training at all levels. A basic four-year strategy guides

unit  training,  with  enhanced  separate  brigades  joining  two  iterations  of the strategy into an eight-year cycle that culminates in a Combat Training Center  (CTC)  rotation.  In  FY  1999, Tiger  XXI,  the  SIMITAR  training program,  was  introduced  to  improve  the  performance  of  Guard  units participating in CTC rotations. Combining live, virtual, and instructional training, the program focuses on training at the battalion staff, company, and platoon levels.

In the field, exercises help  ensure that the reserve components and the  active  Army  train  to  equal  standards.  The  ARNG  and  the  USAR participated  with  the  active  component  in  virtually  every  joint  exercise held in FY 1999, thereby promoting the seamless integration of the total Army force called for in the National Military Strategy. Direct interactions with the other services were not overlooked. The Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana, exposed all fifty-two company-size reservecomponent units training there during FY 1999 to the demands of joint operations.

Overseas training provides reserve component units an opportunity to  very  closely  simulate  operational  deployment  and  to  participate  in combined  and  joint  exercises.  In  fact,  there  is  often  little  distinction between training and operational deployments. USAR units have steadily increased  their  participation  in  such  opportunities  in  recent  years, undertaking  nation-building  missions  and  peace  support  operations and  supporting  deployed  commands.  More  than  thirty-three  thousand National Guard members participated in twenty-one overseas exercises in FY 1999. Like their Reserve colleagues, Guard members obtained firsthand experience in support and stability operations, national assistance, and operational support missions under a unified commander. Overseas training  deployments  provide  an  opportunity  to  practice  mobilization, one of the reserve components' most important contributions to force readiness. The primary focus of reserve-component training is to meet post-mobilization training requirements. When a unit is being mobilized, deployment schedules  consider  its  personnel,  equipment,  and  training readiness.  Required  predeployment  training  times  vary  according  to the size and type of unit and its readiness. Initial readiness processing, final maintenance,  recovery,  and  preparation  for  loading  consume approximately  twenty-six days for an enhanced  separate brigade. Depending on theater-specific requirements and its place in the eightyear training cycle, a brigade could require as many as sixty-four days of training prior to departure. That figure is significantly less for units at the peak of the training cycle, and all enhanced separate brigades are deployable within ninety days of mobilization. For a full division, that ceiling extends to 150 days. Combat service support units are generally capable of deploying within just ten days.

## Mobilization

Those deployment timetables were tested in FY 1999, as they have been with increasing regularity throughout the 1990s. The Army' s reserve components  now  find  themselves  mobilized  for  various  purposes  more often than ever before. As a result of the Bottom-Up Review and Force XXI reforms, the active Army has become dependent on reserve formations to conduct operations of any significant scale or duration.

Mobilization-the  act  of  bringing  reserve  component  units  or  individuals to  active-duty  status-may  be  accomplished  by  several  means.  Under  a Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up, prescribed in Title 10, United States Code, the commander in chief may order as many as two hundred thousand members of the reserve components to active duty for as long as 270 days. In April 1999, President Clinton used this power to dispatch 5,727 members of the various service reserve components to Kosovo.

For more limited contingencies, volunteers are sought before ordering involuntary  mobilization.  The  service  secretaries  have  the  authority  to summon members of the Ready Reserve to fifteen days or less of active duty under Title 10, United States Code, Section 12301(b). State governors have the authority under state law to summon the National Guard to state service.  Governors  may  also  request  that  the  president  federalize  the National Guard during domestic emergencies, such as natural disasters, civil  disturbances,  or  terrorist  incidents. The  Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act  for  Fiscal Y ear  1999  permitted  presidential mobilization of reserve components for emergencies involving weapons of mass destruction.

Authority  for  calling  the  reserves  into  extended  involuntary  active duty rests with the president. On the recommendation of the secretary of defense, the president may consult with Congress and issue an executive order authorizing an involuntary call-up of reserve-component forces. The secretary  of  defense  then  identifies  specific  requirements  and  the  units necessary to meet them. When the orders are issued, Army Reserve and Army National  Guard  units  move  to  one  of  twenty-seven  mobilization sites. There they complete necessary personnel administration procedures, receive  theater-specific  training  required  by  the  gaining  command,  and prepare for deployment. After validation for deployment, units move to a port of embarkation for air or sea transit to the theater of operations.

Reserve  formations  mobilized  for  participation  in  Operations  Joint Forge (Bosnia), Joint guarDian (Kosovo), and southern watCh (Kuwait/ Saudi  Arabia)  during  FY  1999.  The  first  ARNG  military  police  units arrived  in  Bosnia  and  Hungary  during  the  fiscal  year.  A  total  of  865 Guard personnel participated  in  Operation  Joint  Forge  before  the  year ended, supporting peacekeeping efforts in the region. Further to the south,

fifty-three ARNG  members  from  eleven  states  provided  medical,  legal, religious,  and  security  support  for  the  Operation  Joint  guarDian  base camp, Camp Able Sentry, in Skopje, Macedonia. A Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up summoned more than two hundred USAR members to Germany as replacements for active-Army personnel deployed to Kosovo. Their mission was typical of the reserve components' role in emerging contingency operations: relieving active Army forces or personnel to share the strain of high operational tempos and to maintain overall readiness. Toward that end, the first rotations of infantry units from the enhanced separate brigades furnished security for Patriot missile batteries protecting southern watCh forces in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Two National Guard Aviation Task  Forces-consisting  of AH-64  attack  helicopters,  UH-60 assault  helicopters,  and  air  traffic  control  parties-provided  additional support  in  Kuwait.  Approximately  five  hundred  individual  reservists provided support elsewhere for operations of the European Command, the Central Command, and the Special Operations Command.

Members of the USAR deployed to the Middle East on 16 December 1998 to  support  Operation  Desert  Fox,  the  destruction  of  sites  in  Iraq related  to  that  nation' s  efforts  to  create,  procure,  store,  and  maintain weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Approximately  forty  individual  soldiers from the 310th Chemical Company, a biological warfare detection unit, and a liaison team from the 490th Chemical Battalion supported Desert Fox by providing early warning of any potential biological threat.

Reserve-component forces honed their mobilization and operational skills by participating in a number of large-scale exercises during FY 1999. A total of 12,777 ARNG personnel took part in twenty different European Command exercises in FY 1999, including infantry and engineer rotations with the opposing force at the Combat Maneuver Training Center-Europe. Central Command deployments included support for and participation in exercises intrinsiC  aCtion, luCkY sentinel, natural Fire, iron Cobra, and bright star. Pacific Command employed 3,535 ARNG personnel during FY 1999 in support of exercises Foal eagle, Yama sakura, Cobra golD, ulChi  FoCus  lens,  and  the  Eighth Army' s  Reception,  Staging  Onward Movement, and Integration command post exercise. ARNG special forces units participated in many of these exercises and joined others under the aegis of Special Operations Command and of Joint Forces Command. A total of 941 ARNG Special Forces personnel deployed during FY 1999.

The  civil-military Innovative Readiness  Training  (IRT)  program developed from President Clinton' s call to 'rebuild America'  and subsequent legislation. The IRT programs provide the Army, particularly the reserve components, with an opportunity to combine combat service support  training,  operational  deployment,  and  civil  support  into  one mission within the United States. During FY 1999, Army Reserve dental

teams  deployed  to  the  Rosebud  Indian  Reservation  in  Rosebud,  South Dakota, and the Crow/Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in the Crow Agency, Montana, as part of Operation walking shielD. Conceived by the Walking Shield American Indian Society, the deployment provided soldiers with operational and mobilization training while they helped improve the quality  of  life  among  Native Americans on those reservations. This tiny operation, consisting of two teams totaling three dentists and two dental technicians, had tremendous impact on both local health and the teams' experience levels. In two weeks, the teams completed approximately 100 oral surgeries, 60 pediatric dental procedures, 40 root canals, 150 extractions, 150 restorations, and more than 1,500 dental cleanings and exams.

Reserve-component personnel participated in two other IRT deployments during the fiscal year. Operation white Fang dispatched an additional dental team of Army reservists to the Arctic Slope region of Alaska, where they performed a mission similar to that of walking shielD. The final IRT mission of the year, Operation artiC Care '99, also provided combat  service  support  training  to  reserve  personnel  and  humanitarian assistance  to  Native  Americans  in  Alaska,  this  time  in  the  southwest region of the state. From 20 March through 3 April, the 109th Medical Detachment  (Veterinary),  63d  Regional  Support  Command,  taught  460 children how to avoid dog bites, trained five local residents in emergency rabies vaccination procedures, and taught safe food-handling techniques. The unit vaccinated 773 dogs and cats against rabies and 559 dogs against distemper, and it dewormed 731 animals.

Reserve-component forces also formed the core of the Army' s response to a crisis that was at once training mission, operational deployment, and civil support operation. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch followed hard on the heels of September' s Hurricane Georges. The two massive storms devastated much of the Caribbean and large areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast. The commander in chief, U.S. Southern Command, responded with overseas deployment  training  and  a  series  of  exercises  authorized  by  the  Joint Chiefs  of  Staff.  Operation  new  horiZons,  supported  by  the  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, provided both disaster relief for the affected areas and practical training for U.S. personnel.

## Support to Civil Authorities

Humanitarian missions are nothing new for the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. At the state level, the National Guard mission has always been to protect life and property while preserving peace, order, and public safety.  At the federal level, the  Army Reserve mission has always been to provide support, when requested, to local municipalities, cities, and states when their relief efforts have been overwhelmed or exhausted. Governors

of  Mississippi,  Louisiana,  and  Florida  responded to Hurricanes Georges and Mitch by summoning Guard personnel to provide security, evacuation assistance, emergency relief, and support to recovery efforts. Keeping the public informed during major domestic disasters is also an important task. The Army Reserve provided more than five hundred man-days of public affairs support to assist in the Hurricane Mitch relief efforts.

But the damage the two storms inflicted on the United States paled in  comparison  with  the  havoc  they  wreaked  throughout  the  Caribbean basin. Between January and August 1999, a total of 20,800 Army Reserve personnel  deployed  to  Honduras  and  various  storm-damaged  islands, including Puerto Rico. There they distributed relief supplies and provided emergency support. Engineer units constructed medical facilities, repaired roads and bridges, and dug new wells. Through the Army Reserve, with Army National Guard, active  Army, and other military personnel supporting their operations, the United States provided relief to millions of people in the affected region.

The ARNG responded to emergencies large and small at the direction of state governors during FY 1999. In addition to the 82,212 man-days of hurricane relief efforts, ARNG personnel provided a total of 109,778 mandays of support to local civil authorities. Any detailed recounting of such missions would amount to a catalog of the largest natural disasters and law enforcement challenges of the year. But their scale alone is telling.

Fires,  floods,  and  other  natural  disasters  pose  threats  in  wilderness areas and developed regions alike. During FY 1999, fifteen states called on the National Guard for 13,637 man-days of firefighting and related support activities. Guard personnel also respond to other elemental threats. Flood control and relief activities in nine states required 6,176 man-days before the year expired, and drought-related missions consumed 3,409 man-days in ten states. The fact that some governors called on the Guard for both flood  and  drought  relief  indicates  the  variety  of  challenges  confronting ARNG personnel and their flexibility in meeting them.

Tornadoes  are  a  seasonal  danger  in  much  of  the  United  States.  In Oklahoma alone, the National Guard provided 10,728 man-days of tornado response time.  The governors of eight other states called on Guard personnel for an additional 10,117 man-days of effort to combat the impact of the deadly storms. Other weather-related problems in fifteen states brought 4,293 man-days of ARNG labor to the aid of those affected.

The Army National Guard is  also  responsible  for  preserving  peace, order, and public safety. In that capacity, Guard personnel render frequent assistance to law enforcement and other federal, state, and local agencies. Such agencies received 57,185 man-days of assistance from Guard personnel in FY 1999. Of that total, 28,669 days were devoted directly to assisting law enforcement agencies. The vast majority of the time that ARNG  personnel

spent  on  law  enforcement  missions-27,523  of  the  28,669  total  mandays-was provided by the Puerto Rico Army National Guard.

That figure demonstrates the size of the National Guard' s commitment to antinarcotic efforts. In pursuit of the National Drug Control Strategy, governors assign Guard personnel to demand-reduction and drug interdiction  activities.  Guard  missions  in  demand  reduction  may  be broadly characterized as education and community outreach programs. In drug interdiction,  the ARNG executes a number of missions, including cargo inspection assistance, aerial and ground reconnaissance, intelligence analysis,  training,  construction  of  border  fences  and  roadways,  and map production. More than two hundred Guard linguists assisted Drug Enforcement Administration  and  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  drug investigations  during  the  year.  An  additional  five  hundred  personnel supported  the  U.S.  Customs  Service  at  critical  points  of  entry. A  total of  116  OH-58  helicopters,  seventy-six  outfitted  with  forward-looking infrared (FLIR) equipment, supported local, state, and federal marijuana eradication  missions.  USAR  personnel  also  contributed  to  the  Army' s counterdrug efforts, providing 565 personnel for 115 support missions in FY 1999. Those missions included four aviation deployments using FLIR equipment along the southwest border and the dispatch of 298 intelligence analysts who provided invaluable linguistic services to support ongoing drug investigations conducted by civilian authorities.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The  surveillance,  reconnaissance,  aerial  support,  and  intelligence analysis  that  ARNG  and  USAR  members  contributed  to  counterdrug efforts bespeak the reserve components' use of advanced technology. Force digitization  and  the  ongoing  procurement  of  numerous  systems,  from M16A2 rifles to the multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), continued to increase the sophistication of the reserve components' equipment and expand their capabilities. In keeping with their integration into the total Army, the reserve components' equipment is increasingly indistinguishable from that of the active Army.

But the Army still has some distance to go before units of the active and reserve components cannot be distinguished by the age and sophistication of their equipment. Between FY 1997 and the end of FY 1999, the ARNG received more than seventy thousand M16A2 rifles to replace the older M16A1 variant. It was expected that replacement of the older weapon, which uses different ammunition and requires different replacement parts, would not be complete until FY 2003. Guard units also began fielding the M240B medium machine gun. Receipt of the MK19 automatic grenade launcher and M249 squad automatic weapon continued during the year,

but,  according  to  the  schedule  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  the  thirty thousand M249s weapons to be delivered by FY 2002 will still only meet 80 percent of the Guard' s requirements.

The  difficulty  in  completely  equipping  National  Guard  units  with current small arms is at least in part a result of the procedure for funding equipment  procurement  in  the  reserve  components.  Traditionally,  the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Appropriation (NGREA) provided significant support to the reserve components' ability to purchase sufficient equipment to meet mission requirements. But the NGREA is separate from the services' individual appropriations, and as the DOD reemphasized its long-standing policy that parent services are solely responsible for funding the equipment needs of their reserve components, the apparent need for NGREA  support  disappeared.  Since  1997,  the  NGREA  has  declined substantially as the Army has continued to experience difficulty in meeting the  equipment needs of even the active component. The Army's budget has  not  increased  to  offset  the  reduction  in  NGREA  funding.  Reservecomponent forces therefore find it increasingly difficult to meet their needs for upgrades, modernization, and equipment training.

The response to this situation has been driven by the Army equipping policy. That policy, intended to produce modern, fully equipped forces, uses a two-step process to balance total Army readiness against the needs of  early-deploying  units.  The  priorities  are  simple.  First  and  foremost, all units must have sufficient equipment to maintain minimum readiness standards. Second, equipment needs are met in the order of precedence set by the Department of the Army Master Priority List. In accordance with the priorities of that list, the 'first-to-fight' principle applies. Units likely to be involved in combat first have higher priority and receive the most modern equipment.

Although the reserve components receive direct support through the Army's formal budget process, the diminished NGREA funds continue as a significant resource. The ARNG spends its limited NGREA money on  items  that  are  unique  to  the  Guard  or  that  are  not  included  in  the standard  Department  of  the Army  budget  process.  Even  in  the  austere budget environment fostered by decreased NGREA funding and the lack of a corresponding increase in Army appropriations, the National Guard and the Army Reserve continued to receive new equipment and needed upgrades,  thereby  significantly  improving  force  readiness.  The  Guard reported that it possessed 92 percent of its required major equipment in FY 1999, up from 81 percent the prior year. The Army Reserve reported 84 percent of its major equipment needs as met, up from 75 percent in FY 1998. Although these figures lag behind those of other service reserve components and the DOD reserve-component average of 96 percent for FY 1999, the trend is positive.

The Army remains committed to equipping its reserve components to the same standards as the active force, but had not achieved that goal by the end of the fiscal year. In accordance with the Department of the Army Master  Priority  List,  the Army  Reserve  received  substantial  equipment deliveries  from  active-Army  units.  These  included  10  conveyors,  12 armored  vehicle-launched  bridges,  12  Volcano  mine  dispensers,  1,470 single-channel  airborne  radios,  11  generators,  24  smoke  generators, 3,026 squad automatic weapons, 24,637 M40 protective masks, 630 M42 protective  masks,  19  palletized  load  system  trailers,  32  M41  Protective Assessment Test Systems for the M40 mask, 57 dump trucks, 31 wheelmounted cranes, 288 modern burn units, and 11 shower units. The Army also  provided  substantial  equipment  for  the  National  Guard  during  FY 1999.  This  included  17  UH-60A  Black  Hawk  helicopters,  6  MLRS launchers, 153 heavy equipment transporters, 305 line haul tractor trucks, 70 bulk haul trucks, 50 high-mobility trailers, 96 demountable cargo beds, 48 palletized load system trucks, 5,000 single-channel airborne radios, 110 advanced field artillery tactical data systems, 126 artillery muzzle velocity systems, 264 light smoke vehicles, 394 generators, 394 floodlight sets, 13 twenty-ton dump trucks, 5 hydraulic excavators, 1,525 machine guns, 522 grenade launchers, and 2,047 tracked combat vehicle weapons.

Reserve-component forces met other needs through NGREA funds. For  example,  the  National  Guard  purchased  simulators  and  trainers  for combat and combat support systems, including the Armor Fully Integrated System Trainer and the Engagement Skills Trainer. The ARNG also filled some  equipment  shortages  in  high-priority  units  such  as  the  enhanced separate  brigades  and  light  and  medium  truck  companies.  The  Army Reserve acquired conversion kits to modernize its new multi-role bridge companies and sixty-nine glider kits to update older truck tractors.

Both reserve components largely equip their lower priority units with older equipment transferred from modernizing elements of the active  Army. That newly obtained equipment, and existing stocks, can be upgraded and repaired  to  provide  valuable  service. The  Guard  converted  350  M1037 HMMWV 'Humvee' shelter-carriers to the standard M998 cargo/troop carrier  version  at  its  Texas  tactical  wheeled  vehicle  sustainment  repair site,  and  a  twin  facility  in  Maine  converted  120  M996 mini-ambulance HMMWVs to the M998 variant. Lack of funds at the ARNG's equipment depots  delayed  similar  overhaul  programs  for  M9  armored  combat earthmovers and the M60 armored vehicle-launched bridge.

The Army Reserve undertook a number of similar projects. During fiscal  1999,  its  facilities  converted  30  five-ton  cargo  trucks  to  dropside trucks,  139  gasoline-powered  generators  to  diesel,  60  M915  line  haul tractors  to  the  updated  M915A4  configuration,  295  gasoline-powered compressors  to  diesel,  27  heavy  expanded  mobility  tactical  trucks  to

common bridge transports, 43 M967A1 fuel tankers to the multifunctional fuel tanker configuration of the same designation, 9 M101A1 trailers to the  M101A2  model,  9  M101A2  models  to  M101A3s,  and  180  M1037 HMMWV  shelter-carriers  to  the  standard  M998.  The  Reserve  also refurbished forty-one bath and shower units and completed twelve MLC 70 armored vehicle-launched bridge upgrades. A planned upgrade to the M109 shop van was delayed.

The  National  Guard  currently  fields  two  variants  of  the  Abrams main  battle  tank.  Enhanced  separate  brigades  are  equipped  with  the M1A1, mounting a 120-mm main gun. Other units continue to operate the older M1, with a lighter and shorter-range 105-mm main gun. The Army maintained its efforts to upgrade the M1s to M1A1 models, with their greater firepower and survivability, in FY 1999. Congress included $70.2 million in its FY99 appropriation to procure M2A2ODS Bradley infantry fighting vehicles for the ARNG. Delivery of the first vehicles was set for FY 2001.

Maintaining such a wide variety of complex equipment is no easy task. It has benefited from the nearly complete adoption of  Velocity Management (VM), a Total Army process used by all but one of the ARNG' s 54 state or territorial establishments in FY 1999. Under  VM, the tradition of stockpiled commodities is replaced by an automated process similar to that used by private industry that relies on automation, speed, and transportation to get commodities quickly from the factory to the soldier. Receipt processing for repair parts has benefited tremendously from VM.

Commercial models have also been adopted in the actual maintenance and  repair of reserve-component  vehicles.  The  Army's  Integrated Sustainment Maintenance (ISM) program has been in place since FY 1993.  Under  its  provisions,  general  support  maintenance  activities  in Army  Forces  Command, Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  the Army Reserve,  and  the  ARNG  combined  support  maintenance  shops  and maneuver area training equipment sites compete for repair work. Figures from the ARNG demonstrate the effectiveness of the ISM program in FY 1999. Guard units in thirty-seven states participated as customers during the course of the year, shipping 6,059 general support/repair exchange components to other ARNG, Army Reserve, and active Army facilities for repair. Those facilities returned 5,304 of those repaired components for customer use, saving ARNG units $17.9 million through the competitive process. This dramatic increase from the $8.2 million saved in FY 1998 explains  the  Guard's  decision  to  expand  the  types  of  equipment  it  is repairing under the program from seventy-one at the beginning of FY 1999 to 119 at year's end.

Such cost-saving measures have great potential in an undertaking as large as maintaining the National Guard. The fifty states, the District of

Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands host 779 ARNG surface maintenance facilities that support more than six thousand units. The facilities include 645 organizational maintenance shops, 68 combined support  maintenance  shops,  39  unit  training  equipment  sites,  and  24 maneuver  area  training  equipment  sites.  Combined,  they  employed  a workforce of 9,979 federal technicians in FY 1999. That personnel level was also a source of concern for the reserve components. Maintenance facilities are largely staffed by full-time support personnel. Both the Army Reserve  and  the Army  National  Guard  had  validated  requirements  for such personnel well in excess of their authorized FY99 strength. Depot maintenance  as  a  whole  remained  underfunded  at  a  time  when  high operational  tempo  and  aging  equipment  continued  to  place  increased demands on all Army maintenance facilities.

The  director  of  the  Army  National  Guard  and  the  chief,  Army Reserve, listed an increase in full-time support personnel as major goals in  their  Program  Objective  Memoranda  for  FYs  2001-05,  submitted on  11  February  1999.  Expanding  that  labor  pool  would  help  alleviate backlogs at service depots and better equip the reserve components for the maintenance challenges presented by high operational tempos. Those two results would also improve the combat readiness of the total Army. Despite the successes of the European Excess Equipment Project Operation and of  Integrated  Sustainment  Maintenance,  and  slight  decreases  in  depot maintenance backlogs, the ARNG reported an overall decline of 1 percent in its combat readiness for FY 1999. The decline may be explained by high operational tempos and the Army's increasing integration of the reserve and active components that took a toll on the personnel and equipment of the National Guard and the Army Reserve during the year.

## 6 Logistics

## Management and Planning

Meeting the Army's need for supplies and equipment has always been a formidable challenge. The transition from forward positioning to domestic basing and multiple, often remote, and quickly developing deployments during the 1990s has not reduced the complexity of meeting the Army's requirements  for  timely,  reliable,  and  cost-effective  logistic  support. The Army Materiel Command (AMC) and other agencies continued to meet those requirements in FY 1999 while developing new systems and procedures to improve future performance.

Overall  responsibility  for  Army  logistics  changed  during  FY  1999 in  accordance with Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera's 16 February announcement  of  a  secretariat  reorganization.  The  assistant  secretary of  the  Army  for  installations,  logistics,  and  environment  (ASA-IL&amp;E) transferred logistics operations to the assistant secretary of the Army for research, development, and acquisition (ASA-RDA). Although it directly affected  only  nine  personnel,  the  shift  consolidated  acquisition  and logistics policy oversight under a single office to improve efficiency. The titles of the assistant secretaries, and their offices, changed to match their new duties. The ASA-RDA became the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology; the ASA-IL&amp;E became the assistant secretary of the Army for installations and environment.

In the November  1997 Defense Reform Initiative Report, the Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  established  a  blueprint  for  improved business processes, commercial  alternatives, consolidated functions, and  streamlined  organizations  to  modernize  the  supply  and  acquisition process and generally improve the fiscal efficiency of the armed services. Borrowing  from  the  best  practices  of  major  corporations,  the  DOD identified working capital funds and electronic commerce as two areas of potential development.

The Working Capital Funds Policy Board establishes policies at the DOD level that are then executed within the five funds that collectively make up the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). In addition to the

Army Working Capital Fund, the components of the DWCF are the Navy and Air Force Working Capital Funds, the Defense Commissary Agency Working Capital Fund, and the Defense-Wide Working Capital Fund. These funds operate continually without fiscal year limitation and collectively account for roughly one quarter of the DOD direct appropriations, creating buyer-seller  relationships  between  the  services  and  within  the  DOD. Through the DWCF structure, the Army finances support activities such as depot maintenance, supply, research and development, transportation, and information services.

Operations of the DWCF underwent substantial changes during the late 1990s as the Department of Defense sought to establish a more businesslike, vendor-customer  relationship  in  intradepartmental  transactions.  DWCF transactions  involve  approximately  $70  billion  annually,  as  military units  purchase  goods,  services,  and  industrial  capability  from  support organizations. With such a large volume, even minor cost reductions and efficiencies offer significant savings. The goal of the DWCF is not cost reduction,  however,  but  an  improvement  in  the  way  the  DOD  and  the services execute and document their internal financial transactions.

Electronic  commerce  is  a  steadily  growing  trend  in  business  and, more recently, in the DOD. It offers both improved documentation and cost  reduction.  This  application  of  digital  technology  to  automate  and improve business functions requires the integration of business activities in all services through common tools and seamless information transfers. Business affairs within the Defense Department remain expensive and slow because of their substantial requirements for personnel and paperwork and the complexities of coordinating the flow of information-situations that electronic commerce promises to correct. Transferring business processes to  digital  systems  eliminates  the  time  formerly  spent  moving  paper documents from one office to the next. Electronic information processing is  inherently  faster  and  more  responsive,  offering  cost  reductions  and improved service. For that reason the Joint Electronic Commerce Program Office, which opened in May 1998, continued to develop a plan to establish and implement electronic commercial practices, products, and standards within the Defense Department wherever practical.

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), as the armed forces' primary agent for financial management reform, shares those goals. In FY 1999, the DFAS continued to promote the paperless exchange of financial information through electronic document management (EDM), electronic  funds  transfer  (EFT),  and  electronic  data  interchange  (EDI). EDM, relying heavily on World Wide Web applications, replaces paperbased  forms  and  reports  with  their  electronic  equivalents  to  facilitate control, analysis, and overall efficiency. EFT substantially reduces the cost of disbursements by paying salary, travel, and contract expenses without

recourse to paper. EDI improves on EFT by directly exchanging payment information with vendors.

In addition to funds management, the Defense Reform Initiative called for a more general overhaul in defense acquisition, with the goal of superior goods  and  services  faster  and  cheaper  than  current  practices  allowed. Toward that end, the DOD identified twelve defense acquisition goals to be met by FY 2000, goals that all of the services pursued during FY 1999. By achieving those goals, the services can release money for modernization efforts without requesting an increase in total budget authority.

Army  logistics  personnel  continued  to  include  the  goals  of  the Defense  Reform  Initiative  in  their  own  efforts  during  FY  1999.  The complexity  that  logisticians  and  administrators  confront  in  reforming Army business practices is indicated by the Army Audit Agency' s review of  the  FY98  Army  Working  Capital  Fund  (WCF),  completed  in  FY 1999. Because of deficiencies in Army accounting procedures that were themselves being addressed, auditors could not verify the fund' s accounts or otherwise assess its performance, beyond noting its record-keeping and control shortcomings. The Army could not account with certainty for its expenditures from the fund.

The Army Materiel Command made progress toward meeting the goals of the Defense Reform Initiative during FY 1999 despite such obstacles. Implementation  of  a  Single  Stock  Fund  (SSF)  program  promised  to streamline  purchasing  and  eliminate  the  inefficiencies  of  the  WCF  by merging its wholesale and retail elements into a single, nationally managed fund. Wholesale elements of the WCF furnish goods and equipment for further  distribution,  and  retail  elements  provide  them  for  consumption. Trial  programs  at  Fort  Sill  (Oklahoma),  Fort  Lewis  (Washington),  and Redstone Arsenal (Alabama) during FY 1999 paved the way for full SSF implementation.

On  19  May,  the  SSF  Executive  Steering  Committee  recommended that certain items not managed by the Army be excluded from the SSF on the grounds that they are not supported by standard Army information systems supporting the reform. The AMC implemented the recommended changes within the Army Food Management System, Clothing Initial Issue Point System, Fuels Automated System, Integrated Facilities System, and Theater Army Medical Management Information System. Preparations for full SSF implementation went forward, with those exclusions, and included an AMC request for the future funding of a National Business Office to oversee its administration.

The FY99 transfer of major command retail divisions to AMC control placed responsibility for  all Army retail  activities  under  one  command. This  improved  the AMC's  ability  to  overhaul  the Army  supply  system and  implement  the  SSF  program.  But  the  scale  of  FY99  humanitarian

assistance  missions  strained  the  AMC' s  resources  as  it  increased  sales and obligations in some supply activities. The Army' s successful attempt to  seek  funding for contingency and humanitarian operations through a supplemental budget request boosted wholesale (for further distribution) sales 11 percent above planned FY99 levels. Retail (end-user) sales rose through the same mechanism, ending the fiscal year at 2.7 percent over plan. This reduced the wholesale unit cost, or cost per dollar of sales, to $0.97, one cent below the goal for the fiscal year. Sales volumes that were higher than anticipated and unexpected turn-ins raised retail cost to one cent above the $1.00 goal. Despite these fluctuations, the AMC maintained the highest availability rate in the past three years, averaging 85.6 percent immediate availability of stocked items.

Other AMC programs included sustainment systems technical support, the Army mechanism to maintain and improve fielded weapons systems. The  increasing  age  of  major  systems,  combined  with  high  operating tempos, strained resources in this area. For example, a shortfall in funding for contractor logistics support for fixed-wing aviation threatened to ground a  portion  of  the Army' s  aircraft  late  in  the  year,  mirroring  the  familiar problems in funding depot maintenance activities.

To correct such problems, in 1997 the Army instituted a process of transformation that it labeled the Revolution in Military Logistics (RML). During FY 1999, the RML continued as the Army moved toward a velocitybased logistics concept that would be responsive to the needs of the force across the full mission spectrum. Velocity-based logistics, developed in the  private  sector,  replaces  large  and  expensive  warehouse  stockpiles with a constant flow of goods from producer to end user regulated by the rate of consumption. While it enables the Army to meet the sustainment challenges of the National Military Strategy, the RML also addresses the growing demand for lift, or transportation, capacity. When the program is fully implemented, it will revise logistics throughout the force and enable the Army to meet its  goal  of  deploying  a  medium-weight,  brigade-size force anywhere in the world within ninety-six hours.

Toward that end, the Army expects the RML to create a single logistics system, promote distribution-based logistics, enable rapid force projection, create total asset visibility, establish a flexible infrastructure, and reduce the scale of the Army' s logistical requirements (generally referred to as its  'logistical  footprint'). Those  lofty  goals  are  being  met  by  applying information  technology  and  advanced  capabilities  to  the  problems  of acquisition, distribution, and management. The RML stands at the heart of the Army's efforts to balance readiness and modernization, maximizing the use of scarce resources. Those resources transcend budgetary limitations, to include production and transportation capacity, personnel, and facilities. In addition to the obvious economic benefits, the RML increases strategic

responsiveness, decreases  deployment  timelines,  ensures  joint force compatibility  and  support,  creates  an  early-entry  force  able  to  operate without access to fixed forward bases, and reduces sustainment needs.

The Velocity Management (VM) program, which establishes velocitybased logistics throughout the Army as the core of the RML, is intended to decrease the Army' s dependence on stockpiled supplies by relying instead on automation, speed, and transportation to meet its logistics requirements as quickly as commercial systems meet the needs of industry. As it neared full  implementation  within  the  Army  National  Guard,  VM  significantly improved  the  flow  of  repair  parts  and  other  items  to  Guard  units  in  FY 1999. The program continued to identify and resolve delays in the ordering, procurement, shipping, and receipt of supplies as the total force expanded its implementation.

As a key contributor to VM, Army Total Asset Visibility (ATAV) is an  operational  capability  that  integrates  information  from  numerous automated information systems to provide logisticians visibility of stocks in use, in storage, on hand , and in transit. Bar coding and radio frequency identification  technologies  assist  the  process  by  facilitating  automated identification  and  tracking  of  individual  items  and  containers.  ATA V meets critical management needs to reduce duplicative procurement, meet mandated cost reductions, and provide logistics system efficiencies.

The Army designated ATAV as  the  single  authoritative  database  to provide data to the Joint Total Asset Visibility initiative. ATA V provides logistics data to all military services and the Defense Logistics Agency. This  information  can  be  used  to  redistribute  critical  materiel  to  meet emerging requirements. ATAV was used to support Operation Joint Forge (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Operations Desert thunDer and Desert Fox (Kuwait) during FY 1999.

Automatic identification technology (AIT) supports ATA V through the electronic  identification  and  tracking  of  items  as  they  move  through  the logistics system from the factory to their final destination.  The  AIT equipment suite being fielded by the Army includes radio frequency identification, laser optical technology, smart cards, and bar coding. All of these new capabilities are  designed  to  enable  logisticians  to  monitor  cargo  movements,  divert shipments, locate critical supplies, and reduce or eliminate human error.

The Army installed radio frequency identification (RFID) equipment at  fifteen  continental  U.S.  installations  designated  as  power-projection platforms in FY 1999 to provide theater commanders with information on cargo in transit. This effort began in July 1998 to support deployment of the 1st Cavalry Division to Bosnia. RFID equipment was used during FY  1999  to  track  Patriot  missile  equipment  moving  to  Kuwait  for Operation Desert thunDer and again for equipment moving to Kuwait for Operation Desert Fox.

To meet the current needs of rapid deployment and sustainment, the Army maintains stocks of pre-positioned equipment at various locations, including  some  afloat.  One  of  the  seven  pre-positioned  armor-heavy brigade sets remains aboard fifteen Navy-operated vessels, including new large,  medium-speed,  roll-on/roll-off  (RORO)  ships. Three  of  the  other brigade sets are in Europe (Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands), and the  remaining  three  are  in  Kuwait,  Qatar,  and  South  Korea. Additional support-unit equipment, mission-specific packages, and resupply sets are maintained afloat or ashore at overseas or continental U.S. facilities. These practices enable a unit to fly rapidly from the United States, draw heavy equipment from pre-positioned stock, and deploy on a mission without waiting  for  its  equipment  to  arrive  by  ship  or  air  from  the  continental United States. Pre-assembled resupply sets and mission-specific packages then simplify sustainment and theater development.

RORO ships are an invaluable component in the United States' ability to  deploy  heavy  equipment  overseas.  These  vessels  are  equipped  with ramps that make it possible to swiftly load or unload vehicles and cargo with a minimum of shore support. They are, therefore, uniquely suited to deploying the Army's heavy forces, and in conjunction with the Air Force' s C-17  and  C-5  cargo  aircraft,  they  play  a  key  role  in  sustaining  joint operations  overseas. The Army  maintains  a  keen  interest  in  these  three systems and the nation' s overall airlift and sealift capabilities.

The 1995 Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update identified the Army' s sealift requirements to meet the goal of deploying a five and one-third division force package within seventy-five days. Doing so  will  require  nineteen  large,  medium-speed  ROROs (LMSRs), thirtyone smaller ROROs, eight fast sealift ships, six crane ships, two heavy lift  pre-positioning  ships,  three  lighter  aboard  ships,  and  two  container ships. Five LMSRs converted from more traditional freighters are already in service, two of them deployed with pre-positioned stocks. At the end of FY 1999, six purpose-built LMSRs had been delivered, with nine more to follow. The program calls for nine of those vessels to support the afloat pre-positioning program, one for the Marine Corps and eight for the Army, with the rest assigned to the Navy' s surge sealift program.

During  FY  1999,  Army  logisticians  experimented  with  a  new procedure to capitalize on the streamlining and automation initiatives that constitute the RML. Anticipating that RML reforms and budget restraints will  inevitably  reduce  authorized  stockage  lists,  planners  developed  a means to meet a unit's additional stock requirements as it mobilizes for contingency deployment. The Deployment Stock Package-an automated process  that  improves  stock  visibility,  supports  planning,  and  provides real-time  adjustment  capabilities-can  significantly  improve  the  supply performance and readiness of a deploying unit. After successful testing

during unit rotation at the National Training Center, the Deployment Stock Package entered service with units at Fort Stewart (Georgia), Fort Lewis (Washington),  Fort  Campbell  (Kentucky),  Fort  Carson  (Colorado),  and, at the end of the fiscal year, in Kuwait. The program is being expanded to  expedite  corps  and  theater  operations  and  to  create  a  national-level visibility for deployment stock requirements.

## Maintenance

Army depot facilities in the active and reserve components maintain and,  when  necessary,  rebuild  or  upgrade  the Army' s  heavy  equipment. Although they had increased, the levels of full-time support personnel at reserve-component depots continued to fall short of the Army' s need in FY 1999. Assets and parts availability hampered depot activities in both the  active  and  reserve  components,  but  corrective  measures  to  increase coordination among workloads, workload schedules, and asset and repair parts requirements reduced the problem as the year progressed. Customer commands, units or organizations requiring depot services, placed orders earlier  and  so  permitted  the  depots  to  requisition  items  requiring  lead times earlier in the fiscal year. This ensured their availability or allowed schedules to be adjusted to correspond to delivery dates.

At  the  beginning  of  the  fiscal  year,  commands  responsible  for specific commodities assumed management responsibility for the relevant  depots,  another  step  in  improving  depot  efficiency.  Thus  the Army  Communications-Electronics  Command  assumed  command  and control  of  the Tobyhanna Army  Depot  (Pennsylvania).  Similarly, Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command took operational control of the Anniston  (Alabama)  and  Red  River  (Texarkana, Texas)  depots,  and Aviation  and  Missile  Command  assumed  control  of  the  Corpus  Christi (Texas) and Letterkenny (Chambersburg, Pennsylvania) depots.

Fiscal performance of the Army' s depots is assessed in five categories: cost per direct labor hour, financial operating measures, customer revenue rate,  capital  investment,  and  cash  management.  FY99  figures  for  direct labor,  operating  measures,  customer  revenue,  and  cash  management  all reflected positive trends.

In  the  case  of  capital  investment,  establishing  the  positive  trend involved several major projects to maintain and improve depot capabilities by acquiring new equipment and completing minor construction projects. The automated storage and retrieval warehouse system for bulky materiel used in fabrication  and  overhaul  activities  that  consists  of  man-aboard lift  vehicles, automated guided vehicles, and miniature load controllers began replacing a similar but obsolete system. The Army Workload and Performance  System,  a  networked  personal  computer  software  suite

that  integrates  existing  production  and  financial  data,  started  helping production and resource managers optimize their resources and activities. The Standard Depot System/Manufacturing Resources Program, another software  application,  began  making  the  Depot  Maintenance  System compliant with the Defense Information Infrastructure and Joint Technical Architecture.  When  fully  implemented,  the  Standard  Depot  System/ Common Operating  Environment  that  entered  service  during  the  year will create a common user interface across the AMC, reduce the number of unique applications in use, and enable AMC personnel to perform all functions from a single workstation.

Combining  functions  into  a  single  organizing  framework,  as Army depots did through those software initiatives in FY 1999, is a recurring theme in improving Army logistics. Integrated Sustainment Maintenance (ISM)  currently  combines  the  general  support  maintenance  activities of  Forces  Command, Training and Doctrine Command, and the reserve components into  a  single  resource  pool. The  facilities  within  that  pool compete for work, minimizing repair costs and maximizing the Army's overall maintenance efficiency. ISM currently operates on a 'repair-andreturn-to-user' premise. This means that when a unit sends a particular piece of equipment in for depot maintenance, the unit will receive that same  piece  back  when  the  required  repairs,  upgrades,  and  preventive procedures have been completed. Because the Army has no maintenance float, or fleet of available short-term replacement equipment, the unit is without  that  piece  of  equipment  for  the  duration  of  its  depot  overhaul. The absence of such equipment can become a significant readiness issue even with the FY99 reductions in depot maintenance backlogs. The SSF program,  once  fully  implemented,  will  replace  this  system  with  one  of repairing for return to the supply system.

The high operating tempo of FY 1999 led to speculation that supply and maintenance would suffer, adversely affecting training and long-term readiness.  Although  the  threats  posed  by  aging  equipment,  heavy  use, delayed maintenance, and parts or funding shortages were quite real, the Army met the challenge. Programs like VM helped in meeting the Army's maintenance needs and they promise to do more. But preserving the Army' s long-term  ability  to  maintain  deployed  equipment  and  personnel,  or  to sustain a high operating tempo without degradation in mission capabilities, is a problem quite different from routine maintenance.

## Sustainability

When the Army deploys away from its permanent bases or otherwise employs its  equipment  in  nontraining  missions,  its  need  for  logistical support,  and  the  difficulties  in  providing  that  support,  increase  dramatically.

The challenge grows with the scale and duration of an operation and with  its  distance  from  established  support  facilities.  Sustaining Army forces under such circumstances requires prior planning and a complex logistics system.

Equipment readiness  is  one  measure  of  that  system' s  effectiveness. Despite high operating tempos, the Army met most of its readiness goals in FY 1999. The Army uses the mission readiness rates of its sixteen major weapons systems as an indicator of equipment readiness trends, and only two of those systems-the CH-47D helicopter and the heavy expandedmobility tactical truck-failed to meet readiness standards. The entire CH47 fleet (446 aircraft designated CH-47D, MH-47D, and MH-47E) spent part of FY 1999 grounded after a scheduled overhaul of one helicopter revealed  cracked  transmission  gears.  The  Army' s  general  success  in mitigating the adverse impact of aging equipment, high usage rates, and maintenance backlogs is apparent in the overall adequate readiness levels of the last three fiscal years.

Some  of  the  Army's  major  weapons  systems  experienced  minor declines in readiness during FY 1999, although still achieving readiness goals.  The  declines  may  be  attributed  to  limited  assets,  parts  supply problems,  and  changing  customer  orders  at  the Army  depots.  Schedule conformation reports, which calculated the percentage of major systems repairs or overhauls completed on schedule, indicated a substantial decrease in meeting depot maintenance schedules during the fiscal year.

Problems in the delivery of required parts and supplies are a potential source  of  decreased  readiness  and  difficulties  in  sustaining  a  deployed force. The VM program is intended to speed the flow of those materials and prevent unnecessary delays. Although its performance fell short of the  ambitious  goals  set  for  FY  1999, VM  proved  effective  in  reducing the  time  between  ordering  and  receipt  of  supply  items  in  three  priority groups, measured against the FY95 baseline. Such success would not be possible  without  support  by  other  components  of  the  logistics  system. Although parts and supplies pass through the Army' s logistics system with dramatically increased speed as a result of VM and other components of the RML, the Supply Management Activity has maintained the availability of increasingly transient items in its role as the purchaser and warehouse agent for stocks sold to Army operating units.

Securing  and  transporting  required  materiel  in  a  timely  and  costeffective  manner  is  crucial  to  maintaining  the Army' s  ability  to  sustain even  routine operations, a fact that the  Army  Medical  Command (MEDCOM) addressed with a program to standardize its needs, reduce the variety of required supplies, and realize volume savings on the resultant contracts.  North  Atlantic  Regional  Medical  Command  began  with  an effort to standardize sixteen product categories in 1998. The MEDCOM

subsequently expanded that regional effort into a broader medical/surgical standardization program.

By  early  1999,  the  regional  medical  commands  (RMCs)  started  reporting success in standardizing the sixteen categories originally examined by the North Atlantic RMC. Based on varying clinical and business practices in the RMCs, the MEDCOM developed a second informal list of categories for standardization.  At  the  same  time,  the  Department  of  Veterans Affairs provided the MEDCOM with contract access to sixteen hundred standardized  medical/surgical  items.  To  facilitate  the  standardization process, a Defense Supply Center Philadelphia/lead agent partnership hired contractors to staff regional business improvement cells. The MEDCOM business cell staff subsequently analyzed patient databases to develop a clinical workload-driven list of forty-two standardization categories. Items in  those  categories  were  to  be  considered  for  possible  standardization throughout the Department of Defense in FY 2000. These efforts saved the Army $3 million on medical and surgical items by the end of FY 1999. The program also reduced the total volume of the MEDCOM's supply needs, thereby improving the sustainability of Army medical units.

Efforts  to  maintain  and  improve  the  Army' s  ability  to  sustain  its operations range from the seemingly simple, such as standardizing medical supply categories, to the highly complex. The Army relies on maritime transportation for the bulk supplies and heavy equipment that deployed forces require. But port facilities are not always available when and where the Army needs them. Part of the Army's afloat pre-positioned equipment program includes a port-opening package embarked aboard the vessels American  Cormorant,  Strong Virginian, and Gopher  State .  The  vessels carry enough equipment to turn a bare beach into a functioning port facility capable of supporting Army logistics over-the-shore operations.

The  equipment  aboard  these  vessels  requires  periodic  maintenance and  repair.  Every  two  years  the  ships  are  offloaded,  and  their  cargo  of tugboats,  landing  craft,  barges,  floating  cranes,  and  other  equipment  is overhauled and returned to service. This procedure, and the subsequent maintenance,  are  carried  out  at  the  U.S. Army  Equipment  Base,  North Atlantic, in Hythe, England. Strong  Virginian underwent the process for the first time in November 1998. The ship uses its heavy-lift cranes to deploy four LCU-2000 utility landing craft and a modified LCM-8 commandand-control landing craft. Its roll-on/roll-off configuration enables Strong Virginian to  store  and  transport  168  motorized  vehicles,  mostly  highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles and trucks, below deck.

The  Hythe  shipyard-the  only  facility  of  its  kind-maintains  the Army's  forward-deployed  watercraft  and  other  seaborne  assets,  such as  those  aboard  the Strong Virginian, in  a  small  corner  of  the  port  of Southampton. Its mission includes materiel and maintenance support for

thirteen  additional  pre-positioned  equipment  ships  and  maintenance  of smaller vessels such as the one hundred-foot Army tugboat it converted to carry firefighting  equipment  for  the  Military  Traffic  Management  Command in the spring of 1999. That conversion was the first of three that the Hythe shipyard will soon complete to enhance the Army' s firefighting capability. The facility and the 270 watercraft it supports are an important component in the Army's ability to conduct and sustain remote operations.

The Army initiated an ambitious restructuring of its watercraft fleet in FY 1999. The 270 landing craft, tugboats, floating cranes, barges, causeway systems, and utility craft maintained at Hythe were being upgraded and restructured in compliance with warfighting requirement timelines. When complete, the program will create a globally responsive, modern, forwardpositioned fleet capable of sustaining over-the-shore operations in sea state 3 (waves three to five feet high) anywhere in the world.

The Army's ability to handle cargo at both sea and aerial port facilities is becoming ever more important as units increasingly deploy to remote locations  on  contingency  and  humanitarian  missions.  Although  ships remain important, Force XXI and the Army After Next will feature reduced heavy-lift needs and smaller logistical requirements. Air cargo delivery, already vital, will become increasingly important in Army logistics. Units once primarily responsible for unloading and loading ships now handle aircraft and rail transit as well.

With that in mind, the Army's stevedore units, officially designated terminal-service  companies,  have  been  redesignated  as  cargo-transfer companies.  The shifting nature of that community's mission was acknowledged in FY 1999 when the name of the annual Master Stevedore Rodeo,  intended  to  recognize  and  promote  mastery  of  cargo-handling skills, changed to the Master Cargo Handler Rodeo. This minor change in nomenclature reflects the social transitions that accompany the growing complexity of the Army's logistic operations.

## Security Assistance

The Army provides security assistance to allied and friendly nations in  the  form  of  foreign  military  sales,  training,  and  education.  Security assistance  supports  the  Army  mission  by  promoting  U.S.  foreign  and defense policy and helping other countries develop or maintain their own defensive capabilities. These efforts support regional and global stability, reduce the likelihood of direct U.S. involvement in contingency or peace enforcement missions, and increase the capabilities of current or potential coalition and alliance partners and their interoperability with U.S. forces.  As an added benefit, security assistance helps maintain the defense industrial base and reduce the cost of weapons systems and other materiel.

Such  activities  are  administered  by  the  deputy  under  secretary  of the  Army  for  international  affairs  (DUSA-IA)  in  accordance  with  the August  1997  revision  of  General  Order  10  that  reorganized  the Army secretariat.  The  Office  of  the  DUSA-IA  made  substantial  progress  in regularizing its activities and updating relevant Army regulations during FY 1999. For example, its Security Assistance Division updated AR 121, Security Assistance  and  International  Logistics  Support  Policy  and Responsibilities, and  AR  1-75, Administrative  and  Logistical  Support of Overseas Security Assistance Organizations. The new version of AR 12-1  incorporates  the  provisions  of  General  Order  10  that  delegated responsibility for the Army' s international affairs functions to the DUSAIA. Circulation of the new regulations solidified the DUSA-IA' s authority over the conduct of such functions.

The  promulgation  of  the  Army' s  policies  for  exporting  weapons systems  to  friendly  foreign  governments  holds  an  important  position among the international affairs functions of the DUSA-IA. In FY 1999, the DUSA-IA released policies defining the configurations and capabilities of several systems approved for export. These systems included the Javelin missile, the Suite  of Integrated  Radio  Frequency  Countermeasures, M56/58 Smoke Generator, AH-64D Apache, Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures, and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile system. The DUSA-IA also represented the Army in the Arms Transfer Policy Review Group (ATPRG) that the deputy secretary of defense established in FY 1999 to evaluate the arms-transfer process. In its first year of operation, the ATPRG examined the sale of the AH-64D to Kuwait and Singapore, foreign participation in development of the Joint Strike Fighter, transfer of the HARM antiradar missile system to Egypt, and an Arms Transfer Decision Framework to govern future decision making.

The  DUSA-IA  led  the  development  of  the  Army' s  own  decision support system for formulating positions on the transfer of Army property and classified technologies to foreign governments. Work on the creation of that system, a relational database of technology transfer policies, data, and actions, continued throughout FY 1999. When complete, the system will streamline the analysis, review, and processing of requests to transfer classified data, systems, and ordnance to foreign nations. The Air Force and the Navy recognized the value of such a system and adopted that of the Army, thereby consolidating government records into one emerging integrated system.

Such international  transfers  can  actually  save  the Army  money.  By releasing  excess  defense  articles  (EDAs)  to  foreign  military  forces,  the Army can reduce inventory and avoid the cost of disposing of surplus goods. The EDA release process has become quite slow, often requiring more than a year between offering an item to a friendly nation and actually delivering

it, absent an urgent political need. In FY 1999, the Army recommended EDA allocations  to  thirty-one  countries,  with  a  value  of  $1.14  billion. Substantially  less  equipment  was  actually  transferred.  Deliveries  to  six nations, worth approximately $158 million, were completed. Another $22 million worth of equipment was rejected by eight countries because of its poor condition or because the recipient government lacked funds to pay for repairs and shipping. Much of the Army' s foreign security assistance takes the form of training. In FY 1999, the Army provided instruction for 7,623 international students from 142 countries. The Army deployed 273 training teams, totaling 562 personnel, on overseas instructional assistance missions. Despite the size of that effort and the activities of other training centers,  the  United  States  Army  School  of  the  Americas  (USARSA), housed at Fort Benning, Georgia, remained the Army's premier venue for delivering training through its security assistance program. Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 4415 charges the Army, through the USARSA, to develop and conduct professional military education using the Spanish language for  the  military  personnel  of  Central America,  South America,  and  the Caribbean region. In FY 1991, section 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act established  an  Expanded  International  Military  Education  and Training (EIMET) authority that allowed the USARSA to accept civilian personnel and police officers. Under that authority, civilians professionally involved with military matters could receive training from the USARSA or other U.S. military sources in four areas: defense resource management, civilian control of the military, cooperation between law enforcement and military agencies, and military justice systems and human rights.

During FY 1999, public and media attention focused on continuing allegations of human rights violations by graduates of the USARSA and of the USARSA's role in promoting those alleged violations. After examining the accusations and the USARSA's record, the Army leadership issued a strong endorsement of the program. But the unsubstantiated claims that the USARSA promoted human rights violations, and subsequent public outrage,  caused  the  House  of  Representatives  to  include  a  measure  in the  FY00  Foreign  Operations  Appropriations  Act  prohibiting  security assistance funds from being used at the USARSA-a move that effectively would have closed the school. A conference resolution restored the funds but required, before they could be spent, that the secretary of defense certify that instruction and training at the facility were consistent with training and  doctrine  (particularly  in  human  rights)  provided  at  other  defense department institutions that trained primarily U.S. military personnel.

Since 1993, a number of legislators have supported efforts to close the USARSA in response to its alleged role in promoting human rights abuses. In FY 1999, Massachusetts congressman Joseph J. Moakley and Illinois senator Richard C. Durbin introduced bills to repeal the school' s statutory

authorization. Army leaders responded with an education and information campaign intended to counter the school's negative image. As the fiscal year approached its end, the secretary of the Army directed the DUSA-IA to develop a long-term strategy to ensure the school' s continued viability. The August 1999 Report of the Board of Visitors, an external committee responsible  for  reviewing  the  USARSA' s  academic  program,  noted  the exemplary nature of the school' s human rights training.

FY  1999  was  a  busy  year  for  international  cooperative  research and development projects. The DUSA-IA's Cooperative Research, Development,  and  Acquisition  Division  established  fourteen  project agreements and eleven data exchange agreements, arranged four loans, and pursued eighteen additional proposals in those categories. Such activities provide the Army with different perspectives and lines of research that it cannot pursue alone and they strengthen ties between the United States and other nations.

Ties  between  the  Russian  Federation  Army  and  the  U.S.  Army weakened in FY 1999 in response to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  operations  in  Serbia. As  one  example,  the  Russian  procurator general had settled on the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice as the best available model for reforming the Russian military justice system. The Office of the DUSA-IA strongly supported the Russian interest, seeing a means to support Russian development of improved democratic rule of law in military affairs. Unfortunately, the strained relations postponed a scheduled  visit  to  the  United  States  by  the  Russian  Main  Procuracy  to discuss the reform.

Relations  with  the  Chinese  People' s  Liberation  Army  suffered  a similar  setback.  A  May  1999  China  Engagement  Workshop  hosted  by the DUSA-IA developed a schedule of exchange events, including a visit to  China  by  the  superintendent  of  the  United  States  Military Academy, a  language  exchange  visit  by Academy  cadets,  and  a  possible  military history exchange. Planning came to a halt, and all military ties with China were  severed,  as  a  result  of  the  7  May  accidental  U.S.  bombing  of  the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Belgrade during NATO air strikes targeted against the Yugoslavian government.

In accordance with the 1997 Defense Reform Initiative, the international emergency planning function of the Office of the Secretary of Defense transferred to the Army. The DUSA-IA assumed responsibility for the function-known as civil-military emergency planning (CMEP)on 11 March 1999, and executed its first CMEP event in September 1999. The Earthquake Preparedness Workshop for Southeastern Europe Defense Ministerial (SEDM) nations met in Varna, Bulgaria, to discuss database development and communications needs in planning for shared response to  major  earthquakes.  In  a  concurrent  session  within  the  SEDM,  the

five  Partnership  for  Peace  (PFP)  members  discussed  sustained  regional cooperation  in  civil  protection.  The  PFP  is  a  program  that  promotes practical  security  cooperation  between  NATO  and  former Warsaw  Pact nations. Bulgaria introduced a proposal to establish a CMEP Council for the five PFP and three NATO nations of the SEDM.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The reconfiguration of the Army from the Cold War force, through Force XXI, to the Army After Next is partly a response to the technologydriven revolution in military affairs. To fully exploit the capabilities that digital information technologies, advanced materials, and parallel changes in business and operational practices offer, the Army continues to invest heavily in the development and production of new systems and the revision of old policies.

A sample of the  potential  this  process  offers  may  be  found  in  two comparatively  small,  complementary  programs:  the  Army  fuel  privatization/ outsourcing initiative and the procurement of alternative-fueled vehicles under the Army energy program. In November 1998, the Army replaced thirteen  government-owned  and  -operated  fuel  facilities  at  Fort  Bragg, North  Carolina,  with  two  contractor-owned  and-operated  facilities.  In February  1999,  a  single  privately  owned  and  operated  facility  replaced the government fuel facilities at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Those two contracts will save the Army an estimated $3 million over a twenty-year period. Seventeen other Army facilities are under consideration for this program, which reduces government-owned infrastructure and associated personnel costs while maintaining a vital support activity.

During FY 1999, the  Army' s alternative-fueled vehicle (AFV) program, involving energy sources such as propane, liquid natural gas, and electricity, accounted for 32 percent of all acquired or leased general service vehicles. Although still short of the 75 percent goal of the Energy Policy Act, the 1,365 AFVs in service decrease the Army's thirst for petroleum products and help meet environmental goals. In conjunction with fuel privatization, AFVs  offer  the  potential  to  significantly  alter  transportation  on  Army facilities without requiring extensive government investment in alternative fuel infrastructure.

But alternative fuels and environmental protection are only two aspects of the Army's ongoing efforts to develop and procure more effective and efficient  systems  to  facilitate  its  mission.  During  FY  1999,  the  Army ordered the reorganization of the offices responsible for those efforts. On 18 November 1998, the vice chief of staff approved the 1 October 1999 consolidation  of  Army  developmental  and  operational  testing  under  a single command, the preexisting Army Operational Test and Evaluation

Command (OPTEC). That command's name was slated to change to Army Test and Evaluation Command when the consolidation occurred.

Army research and development did not halt to await the restructuring scheduled for the first day of FY 2000. The OPTEC, originally formed as an independent Army agency, pursued an extensive list of projects during FY 1999 in cooperation with other Army agencies and civilian contractors. Those projects were guided by the Army Development, Acquisition, and Fielding Strategy (DAFS), a 1999 statement supporting the Army Science and  Technology  Master  Plan  and  the  Army  Modernization  Plan.  In accordance with the DAFS, the Army is moving away from the traditional 'stovepipe'  model  of  linear  research,  development,  and  acquisition of  individual  systems  to  a  system-of-systems  approach.  That  concept recognizes every piece of equipment, soldier, and system as part of a larger system for performing the  Army mission. It stresses integration, cooperative development, and component commonality. Spiral development, in which the  combat  developer,  materiel  developer,  contractor,  and  warfighter work closely to advance a project from requirements, through design, to implementation and testing, complements this system-of-systems approach to speed the process and ensure its focus on the warfighter' s needs.

New  Army  systems,  in  accordance  with  the  DAFS  and  Army practice,  advance through four phases in the development, acquisition, and  fielding  process.  The  first  phase,  concept  exploration,  marks  the transition between basic research and systems development. It consists of competitive, parallel, short-term studies to define and evaluate alternative concepts. In the program definition and risk-reduction phase, programs are  identified  as  specific  concepts  and  approaches.  Alternatives  are assessed and risks identified. During the engineering and manufacturing development  phase,  the  most  promising  approach  is  translated  into  a stable, interoperable, producible, supportable, and cost-effective design. Manufacturing  processes  are  validated,  and  the  system' s  capabilities are  tested  to  identify  necessary  fixes  or  upgrades.  In  the  final  phaseproduction,  fielding/deployment,  and  operational  support-the  system achieves operational status, fulfilling mission requirements. Remaining difficulties are identified and resolved, and systems in this phase retain the potential for further development.

The  Army's  publication Weapons  Systems  1999 identifies  ongoing projects within those four phases. It also links systems with the relevant pattern(s) of operation defined in  Army  Vision 2010.  Those patterns provide a template for  Army development and identify the role that specific systems will play in the overall system of systems. The patterns of operation are these:  project  the  force,  protect  the  force,  gain  information  dominance, shape the battlespace, conduct decisive operations, and sustain the force. Specific projects however, may be better understood in the broader mission

categories of information dominance, force overmatch, essential research, recapitalization, and contributing capabilities.

The  Army  pursued  a  number  of  projects  intended  to  enhance information dominance in FY 1999. Many of those programs were already in the production, fielding/deployment, and operational support phase of development. These included the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System, Analysis and Control Team Enclave, Army Airborne Command and  Control  System,  Army  Key  Management  System,  and  the  Digital Topographic Support System. These systems, and those in the engineering and manufacturing development and other phases (like the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below system) collect, process, and disseminate information on the digital battlefield.

Such  systems  are  part  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  Army  Battle Command System (ABCS), the overall concept for a system of systems integrating information from various platforms and sensors. Their continued development in FY 1999 supports the emergence of the ABCS as  an  operational  reality.  As  it  nears  full  functionality,  the  ABCS  will link automation assets, communications media, and operational forces to support the Army's command, control, communications, and intelligence capabilities in real time. The potential impact of such a rapid, integrated flow of communications, enabled by information technology, is the driving force behind the Revolution in Military Affairs.

Knowing  where  and  how  to  employ  force  does  little  good  if  the Army lacks the fire power and robustness to accomplish its mission. The Army  avoids  this  obvious  pitfall  by  maintaining  force  overmatch-the combination  of  lethal,  mobile,  and  survivable  weapons  systems  that enables its units to seize and exploit the advantage provided by information dominance. Most of the high-profile systems under development during FY 1999 fell under this general category. But the dividing line between information dominance and force overmatch is not entirely clear because the two mission categories interact closely and frequently coexist within the same unit or piece of equipment.

This ambiguity in mission categorization is embodied in the RAH66 Comanche helicopter, which remained in the program definition and risk-reduction phase during FY 1999. The Comanche, as a stealthy armed reconnaissance helicopter, contributes to both information dominance and force overmatch. Its digital information suite will facilitate communications among flight crews, Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System aircraft,  and  other  ground-based  and  airborne  weapons  platforms  and command-and-control  facilities.  Advanced  electro-optical  sensors  and target recognition capabilities will allow the Comanche to add information to the battlespace network. And its low radar signature and armament of air-to-ground missiles and rockets, air-to-air missiles, and 20-mm cannon

enable the Comanche to exploit that information on deep, precision-strike missions as a potent ingredient in force overmatch.

The first  Comanche prototype returned to the skies in late October 1998 after the installation of various improvements. The second prototype completed  its  first  flight  test  on  30  March,  and  both  aircraft  continued to  operate  throughout  the  year.  The  testing  proved  successful  enough that  the  Boeing  Sikorsky  RAH-66  Comanche  Joint  Program  Office delivered a $3.1 billion proposal to the Army on 23 August. The proposal recommended the construction of thirteen more RAH-66 helicopters for continued Army testing and evaluation and the initiation of the engineering and development phase of the Comanche program in early 2000.

Crusader, like Comanche, was in the program definition and riskreduction phase during FY 1999 as a program contributing to the Army's ability  to  overmatch  an  opposing  force.  As  the  premier  indirect  fire support system of Force XXI, the Crusader is a notable advance over the M109A6 Paladin and M992 ammunition supply vehicle combination it will replace. Improvements include extending the new howitzer's radius of  fire  more  than  ten  kilometers  beyond  the  Paladin' s  thirty-kilometer maximum, a sustained rate of fire of ten to twelve rounds per minute compared to the Paladin's one round per minute sustained rate or threeminute  burst  of  four  rounds  per  minute,  and  the  ability  to  launch  a simultaneous impact strike  of  four  to  eight  rounds  with  a  single  gun. The new 155-mm howitzer also offers automated ammunition handling, automatic  resupply  and  refueling  from  the  system's  integral  support vehicle, and a remote multioption fuze capability, all improvements over the older system. A Crusader's three-man crew is one person smaller than the Paladin's and, as a result of the range and rate-of-fire improvements, it commands combat power surpassing that of three of the older Paladin artillery pieces combined.

A March 1998 in-process review determined that the Crusader program was ready to proceed from the design stage into the construction of initial prototypes. The prototypes were to be delivered in December 1999, but in the FY99 Defense Authorization Act the legislature withheld funding for  the  Crusader  until  five  critical  issues  could  be  resolved. The Army responded to those concerns in a February 1999 report that asserted the new system would be the first American 155-mm howitzer since the First World War that could claim superiority over other self-propelled 155-mm systems. The Crusader, clearly a revolution in tactical artillery systems, would fill an urgent requirement, provide critical support for the Army and Joint Vision 2010, deliver an optimum blend of cost and performance, and satisfy the requirements of the Force XXI campaign. With those concerns resolved, the program continued, but it remained behind schedule for the rest of the fiscal year.

In addition to programs providing information dominance and force overmatch in the near to mid-term, the Army supports essential research and  development  projects  seeking  both  incremental  improvements  in existing systems and leap-ahead technologies. Careful management of the service' s limited science and technology funding is vital to the success of these efforts, which also seek to leverage the advances of other services, government agencies, industry, and academia. Funding for these programs is  guided  by  a  set  of  more  than  two  hundred  science  and  technology objectives that establish specific, measurable advances to be achieved in each fiscal year.

The Brilliant Antiarmor  submunition  (BAT)  and  the Tactical  HighEnergy Laser (THEL), which were in the engineering and manufacturing development stage that immediately precedes production, were among the most mature research projects the Army pursued during FY 1999. The BAT submunition  completed  production  qualification  and  received  approval for initial production before the end of the fiscal year, while design and testing  of  its  first  scheduled  product  improvement  upgrade  continued. The upgrade will possess improved target acquisition capabilities, adding millimeter-wavelength  radar  to  the  acoustic  and  infrared  seekers  of  the original  BAT  submunition,  and  will  feature  an  enhanced  warhead. The THEL, a cooperative project of the DOD and the Israeli ministry of defense, is intended to provide local and theater-level protection from short-range artillery  rockets.  With  the  Space  and  Missile  Defense  Command  as  its U.S.  executive  agent,  the  THEL  successfully  demonstrated  its  target identification and tracking capabilities and achieved 'first light'-the first firing of its weapon-strength laser-during FY 1999. On 7 July, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the Joint  Theater  Air and Missile Defense Mission Needs Statement, identifying the need for the capabilities that the THEL, as an advanced-concept technology demonstration project, promises to develop.

Such efforts to develop future systems and technologies cannot ignore the need to adapt and improve existing Army systems to maximize their capabilities and extend their useful operational life spans. Identifying such potential  developments is part of the Army' s research and development strategy. Overhauling, updating, and modifying existing equipment is the purpose of the Army's recapitalization effort.

The Army recapitalized a number of systems during FY 1999. For example, during the second quarter of FY 1999, managers of the highmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle program completed their analysis of  alternatives,  the  basis  of  the  strategy  that  will  guide  the  program' s modernization  efforts  through  FY  2023.  The  product  manager  of  the M113 family of vehicles derived from the basic armored personnel carrier continued to purchase upgrade kits to convert older variants of the tracked

vehicle into new configurations, completing 230 such modifications during the fiscal year. Full-rate production of the M109A6 model of the Paladin self-propelled howitzer ended on 25 June, whereas the Army continued to  pursue  upgrades  such  as  the Automatic  Fire-Control  System  XXI  to increase the weapon's capabilities. National Guard artillery battalions in New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin received the howitzer during FY 1999 as the Army continued to upgrade the existing M109A2/A3 Paladins to the M109A5 model.

Finally, the Army also develops and acquires capabilities that support the patterns of operation identified in Army Vision 2010 but do not fit into any of the clearly definable patterns of operation. Such systems fall into the general mission category of contributing capabilities. They improve the mobility and lethality of Army forces, enhance their survivability, or otherwise promote their mission performance.

During  FY  1999,  those  projects  included  continuing  research  into the environmental restoration of Army facilities and tele-engineering, the Army  Corps  of  Engineers'  initiative  to  support  deployed  engineers  by providing them with the capability to teleconference with, and otherwise draw on, the knowledge and capabilities of subject matter experts located elsewhere. Army medical researchers continued development of the fibrin bandage in conjunction with the American Red Cross, and contracted to the University of Cincinnati (Ohio) the development of a means for extending the shelf-life of blood stores. The first project will save lives by including a clotting agent in bandages, and the second will enhance the Army' s ability to maintain blood supplies in remote locations.

Through such research, development, and procurement programs the Army maintains its current and future ability to fulfill its mission under the National Military Strategy.  Army logisticians manage the flow of goods and services to the active and reserve components; provide for the maintenance of equipment and facilities; sustain Army forces in the field; assist friendly nations  with  their  security  and  emergency  response  requirements;  and direct the Army' s research, development, and acquisition programs. They provide Army personnel with the supplies and tools required to put doctrine and training into practice.

## Support Services

The Army's  mission  performance  ultimately  depends  on  its  ability to  train,  equip,  and  maintain  soldiers.  In  turn,  the  need  to  maintain soldiers requires the Army to address their individual needs. Physical and emotional health, pride and job satisfaction, and intellectual and personal growth are important factors in maintaining both the short- and long-term effectiveness  of Army  personnel.  Such  needs  address  the  basic  human desire for an acceptable quality of life. Failure to meet those needs would reduce the appeal of military service to both current and potential soldiers, with all that such a reduction implies for the Army' s ability to maintain force readiness in the face of an accelerating operating tempo. The Army supports its mission capabilities by offering a number of programs to meet the needs, and improve the quality of life, of individual soldiers.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The Army recognizes quality-of-life issues as a high-priority concern, addressed in part by Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs. Administered by the Army Community and Family Support Center, MWR programs provide a variety of recreational activities, community events, personal enrichment opportunities, and family support functions. Those programs are provided through MWR facilities located on Army posts. MWR personnel  operate  fitness  centers,  libraries,  indoor  and  outdoor recreation centers, arts and crafts centers, automotive skills facilities, and entertainment and leisure travel programs on Army installations around the world. Surveys indicate that the most popular MWR offerings, such as fitness centers, are used by more than half of all eligible military personnel. The  majority  of  MWR  programs  enjoy  the  participation  of  more  than 30 percent of all  eligible  personnel. The  semiannual  Sample  Survey  of Military Personnel conducted in the spring and fall of 1998 indicated that the quality and availability of such programs ranked among the ten most popular aspects of military life.

Two of the three major concerns for both MWR and its subordinate family programs in FY 1999 were securing the exemption of key activities

from  ongoing  A-76  Commercial  Activities  studies,  which  explore  the possible privatization of Army activities in compliance with the Federal Activities  Inventory  Reform Act  of  1998,  and  the  creation  of  baseline operational standards for each program to identify required resources. The assistant secretary of the Army (manpower and reserve affairs) complied with the October 1998 recommendation of the MWR board of directors to exempt sports and fitness, child and youth services, and several other categories of MWR activities from possible privatization under the A-76 process. This decision maintained the integrity of MWR programs and the workforce's depth and flexibility. MWR leaders met their second major concern for FY 1999 by developing baseline operating standards for core programs,  including  sports  and  fitness,  child  and  youth  services, Army community service, recreation, and libraries. Those standards established requirements  for  future  budget  cycles.  MWR  also  supported  stabilized funding for base operations (BASOPS) as its third major goal for the year. Continued shortfalls in the BASOPS maintenance and repair accounts that fund the required upkeep of facilities on Army installations often leave commanders little choice but to divert funds from the accounts intended to support MWR functions on the grounds that properly maintained facilities contribute to good morale.

Despite the reallocation of funds to BASOPS accounts, MWR activities executed almost 99 percent, or $182.5 million, of their authorized $185 million FY99 budget. Family programs, operating from separate accounts, suffered greater diversions and were able to execute only 95 percent of their $203.2 million budget. Army community service activities stood out from the rest of the family programs, however, by spending 101 percent of their allocated $40.5 million as a result of funds that local commanders diverted from other areas.

MWR's  recreation programs  began full implementation of the Recreation Delivery System  in  FY  1999.  This  new  administrative approach includes the accreditation of all community recreation programs by the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies, an independent commission that establishes firm standards for personnel, training, programming, equipment, and facilities. MWR's  internal standards seek to exceed those required for accreditation, with the goal of guaranteeing standard levels of exceptional service throughout the Army.

Soldiers' needs  for  off-duty recreation, morale  programs,  and welfare services are not overlooked while they are on deployment. As FY  1999  drew  to  a  close,  thirty-eight  MWR  professionals  provided United  Services  Organization  entertainment  programs,  recreational activities, and special events to Army personnel at nine sites in Bosnia and  Kosovo. A  number  of  family  programs  also  continued  to  address the needs of soldiers approaching, on, or completing deployment during

the fiscal year. These programs included Family Readiness Groups, the Army Family Teambuilding Program, and the Army Family Action Plan. Each of those programs seeks to improve the quality of life for Army personnel  and  their  dependents,  focusing  on  problem  areas  identified through previous experience.

## Health and Medical Programs

The  Army  Medical  Department  (AMEDD)  is  responsible  for  the Army's health needs. This is a complex task, combining medical research, field medicine, and routine health care. In each of those areas, the AMEDD applies  the  latest  business,  technological,  and  scientific  advances  to preserve the force, meet the emerging needs of Force XXI, and develop future capabilities.

In FY 1999, the special appropriation for the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command totaled $367.4 million, the highest research and development funding for Army medicine in more than a decade. Those funds supported research with potential benefits far beyond the Army but often in short supply. For example, the Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine has been pursuing research into Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens since FY 1992. In that year, the Department of Defense (DOD)  Authorization Bill approved $850,000 to support the  Army' s role as executive agent for the DOD Lyme Disease Program. The FY92 Appropriations Bill, however, did not fund the program. Actual research could not begin until the FY94 budget authorized the diversion of $850,000 from elsewhere in the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command budget.  Supplemental  funds  the  following  year  included  $500,000  in dedicated funding, but the research effort received no further support until FY 1999. The Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine \secured $1.5 million of the FY99 allocation to combat the debilitating illness  by  improving  detection  capabilities,  conducting  epidemiological studies, and creating a field detection test kit.

AMEDD research and development efforts  generally  parallel  those of the civilian medical community, but the Army's special requirements guarantee it a unique role in the pursuit of some capabilities. The need to provide medical  support  in remote  locations, for example,  has encouraged the Army to pursue telemedicine's potential to link patients and local medical  personnel with distant medical  experts through advanced information systems. The Armed Services Biomedical Research Evaluation and Management Committee and the director of research and engineering  approved  the  criteria  of  the  Joint  Science  and  Technology Plan for Telemedicine on 1 October 1997. Since that time, the Army has pursued  research  into  integrated  telemedicine  and  telecommunications

technologies with the goals of improving speed and accuracy of diagnosis, initiating emergency treatment during the critical first hour, and assisting emergency medical specialists or rescue teams in responding to medical emergencies in remote locations.

The  emergency  telemedicine  project  included  four  components  in FY 1999. In the radiology component, the AMEDD advanced research to enable a low-skilled operator to acquire and transmit ultrasound images for interpretation by a radiologist. This capability will dramatically improve emergency diagnosis in remote or isolated environments. The home health component began evaluating the patient' s own ability to operate medical monitoring  devices  linked  to  a  supervising  health  care  provider,  again promoting early diagnosis and intervention. In the wavelet compression component,  the  AMEDD  explored  the  application  of  advanced  data technology to compress bandwidth requirements, thus further reducing the cost of telemedicine. Finally, the Center of Excellence for Biological and Chemical Medical Response continued working closely with emergency medical service providers in Philadelphia to apply telemedicine practices, and improve response, to biological or chemical disasters.

These efforts also support the Medical Communications for Combat Casualty  Care  (MC4)  program,  which  received  its  first  procurement funding during FY 1999. The MC4 program provides an integrated system of  medical  products,  information,  and  communications  capabilities  to link all echelons of Army medical care both horizontally and vertically. Its equipment will eventually include the Warfighter Physiological Status Monitor,  a  device  intended  to  monitor  the  soldier  and  automatically provide medical personnel with a location and vital signs in the event of an emergency. The MC4 program extends the promise of telemedicine and networked systems to frontline medical care.

There is a substantial gap between knowing about a wounded combatant and being able to provide medical intervention. The Army' s FY99 budget included funding for several systems intended to improve the AMEDD's ability to provide combat medical support, addressing issues that came to light during Operation Desert storm. That operation revealed that both the M577A2 treatment vehicle and the M113 armored ambulance lack the speed, maneuverability, and survivability needed to operate with modern mechanized forces.

The  FY99  budget  included  $3.86  million  for  development  of  the Armored  Medical  Evacuation Vehicle,  a  modification  of  excess  M2A0 Bradley fighting vehicles intended to replace the older M113 ambulance. The new vehicle maintains parts that are common with the Bradley vehicle family,  integrates  modern  communications  and  vehicle  performance capabilities, and can provide advanced trauma care at the pace of current mechanized  operations.  Another  Bradley  variant,  based  on  the  M4A1

command-and-control vehicle chassis, is the armored medical treatment vehicle. Leveraged  from  development  of the command-and-control vehicle,  which  is  differentiated  only  by  mission-unique  equipment,  the armored medical treatment vehicle was an unfinanced requirement in FY 1999, intended to replace the obsolete M577A2.

The AMEDD's greatest medical modernization issue in FY 1999 was an  entirely  different  type  of  vehicle.  The  UH-60Q  medical  evacuation helicopter,  an  upgrade  of  existing  Black  Hawk  helicopters,  completed operational  testing  in  September  1998  and  entered  engineering  and manufacturing  development  during  FY  1999.  Although  the  AMEDD sought to procure the UH--60Q at the earliest possible date, the deputy chief of staff for operations and plans preferred to postpone production until the start of the UH-60A service-life extension program in 2002. The two positions remained unreconciled through FY 1999.

Advanced capabilities to treat and transport wounded soldiers are of little use without skilled medics. During FY 1999, the AMEDD continued preparations for the transition to a new military occupational specialty, the 91W health care specialist. Combining the old 91B and 91C specialties, the new category would incorporate enhanced skills in combat casualty care, force health protection, ambulatory/emergency care, and extended critical care. The pretransition phase for the shift to the new classification, providing supplementary training to existing 91B and 91C specialists, was scheduled to begin in FY 2000.

The shortage of reserve-component medical personnel continued in FY 1999. A 1996 study by the Office of the Chief,  Army Reserve, indicated that 81 percent of U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) physicians could mobilize for up to ninety days without serious consequences for their civilian practices, but  extension  beyond  that  time  limit  often  led  to  loss  of  employment. As  a  result  of  this  professional  barrier,  34.2  percent  of  the  physicians deployed in Operation Joint enDeavor and Operation Joint guarD left the USAR. Despite a reported overall officer and warrant officer fill rate of 104 percent in the AMEDD's reserve-component strength for FY 1999, the figure dropped to only 62 percent for officers and warrant officers in critical  wartime  specialties.  Recruiting  and  retention  efforts  focused  on this need, with little success.

Routine  health  care  for  active-component,  active-duty  reserve,  and dependent personnel is provided through Tricare, the DOD's network of military medical facilities and civilian care providers. During FY 1999, the program expanded to include Tricare Prime Remote, a network of health care providers in areas removed from major military facilities. Although the program suffered from administrative problems, it did begin to offer Army personnel full health coverage despite the lack of local military care facilities. Congress included a similar program for retirees, Tricare Senior

Supplement, in the  FY99 appropriation  as  a  demonstration  program.  It was  scheduled  to  open  in  eight  locations  during  FY  2000,  providing  a Medicare supplement to program members.

During FY 1999, the AMEDD responded to the president's directive that all federal agencies place additional emphasis on the ability to manage the  consequences  of  the  use  of  nuclear,  biological,  or  chemical  (NBC) weapons against the United States.  The  AMEDD began a two-week Medical NBC Readiness Workshop, to be offered each September. Personnel from each service branch, including members of the ten National Guard Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection Teams that began forming in FY 1999, received training in medical responses to NBC threats. Workshop content is expected to change each year, as trained personnel are assigned worldwide to support military missions.

## Army Chaplaincy

The Chaplain Corps furthered its efforts to adapt to the demands of increasing operating tempos and the needs of the Army' s Force XXI and AAN  architectures  during  FY  1999,  including  the  need  for  expanded use of information technology. An important component of those efforts, the  Chaplaincy  Automated  Religious  Support  System,  entered  service throughout the Army during the fiscal year. The system automates much of the clerical work associated with Army chaplains' religious support and special staff work. Its first module, the Command Master Religious Program, automates financial, manpower, and facility management.  A related initiative, completed in June of 1999, provided video teleconferencing capabilities in each participating major command chaplain' s office. The system can connect as many as twelve locations in a single conference, thus helping chaplains coordinate their efforts while providing a valuable humanitarian tool.

The Chaplain Corps continued to develop a conceptual framework and testable model for military religious support activities capable of meeting the  requirements  of  activity-and  service-based  costing  initiatives.  The new framework redefined religious support programs as 'social behavior products,' identifying the costs of the chaplaincy in comparison with the resulting cost avoidance. This methodology reflects the unique character of religious support. Previous methodologies, developed outside the Chaplain Corps, followed medical or legal models in assigning cost structures. These models produced inaccurate results when applied to the chaplaincy.

The shortage of Army chaplains, particularly in the Roman Catholic denomination, persisted in FY 1999. The shortage of priests remained an issue throughout the United States in FY 1999, but the trend was particularly troubling in the Army, in light of the growing number of Roman Catholic servicemembers. In August 1999, senior Army leadership approved the

organization of the Directorate of Ministry Initiatives (DMI), which was slated to enter service in November 1999. The DMI is intended to bring about a more balanced representation of religious denominations in the Army chaplaincy, beginning with an aggressive campaign to increase the representation of Roman Catholics in the corps.

## Army Pay

The strong economy of the mid-1990s produced public and congressional  interest  in  a  perceived  gap  between  military  and  privatesector civilian pay. The financial boom brought with it expanded privatesector job opportunities, increased civilian pay rates, and a civilian standard of  living  that  placed  military  housing  and  lifestyles  at  a  disadvantage. Recruiting, retention, and morale suffered accordingly.

Army pay consists of the basic pay for a grade and time in service, supplemented by a basic housing allowance for personnel not living in military housing and a basic allowance for subsistence to cover meals for those not eating in military facilities. These three components combine to  establish  a  figure  for  regular  military  compensation,  the  index  of military pay most often used for comparison with private-sector civilian incomes. Special pay and bonuses, reimbursements, educational benefits, and nonmonetary benefits such as health care and access to military retail stores are specifically excluded from regular military compensation and most comparisons with civilian pay scales.

Increases in basic pay are linked to raises in civil service pay through a formula that applies to both, unless Congress acts to sever the two or make other adjustments for a specific budget cycle. Each quarter, the Department of  Labor  establishes  the  Employment  Cost  Index  (ECI),  a  measure  of wage increases for private-sector employees. Increases in general service schedule civil service compensation are established by comparing the ECIs for the third quarters of the previous two fiscal years. The resulting rate of increase, if any, less half a percentage point, becomes the basic adjustment in civil service and military pay.

That  formula  produced  Army  pay  increases  in  fiscal  years  1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999. Passage of the FY 2000 National Defense Authorization Act in 1999 suspended the formula from FY 2000 through FY 2006, setting a new military equation at ECI plus half a percentage point, a 1 percent increase over the former method. Congress generally ignores the statutory formula and the linkage between civil service and military  pay  by  enacting  specific  legislation  that  is  occasionally  to  the Army's benefit. In FY 1999, legislators surpassed the 3.1 percent increase dictated by the formula by authorizing a 3.6 percent pay raise for both military and civil service personnel.

As a measure of rates of increase rather than specific dollar amounts, the ECI does not facilitate a simple comparison between military and privatesector civilian pay.  Although allegations of a civilian-military pay gap have persisted for decades, establishing an accurate comparison is difficult. The complexity of military pay and the nonmonetary compensation provided to servicemembers make any comparison with purely monetary privatesector compensation quite difficult, and the existence of any real difference is difficult to demonstrate or quantify.

Comparability  with  private-sector  civilian  pay  is  not  the  Army' s primary  interest  in  establishing  compensation  levels.  Rather,  the Army needs to ensure competitiveness. Total compensation for military service, comprising  its  monetary,  nonmonetary,  and  intangible  rewards,  must compete  with  civilian  compensation  for  both  skilled  recruits  and  the continuing service of career personnel. The Army pursued improvements in military housing, health care, educational benefits, and pay increases throughout the 1990s to maintain its appeal to high-quality personnel.

## Army Housing

Improving Army housing  remains  a  formidable  challenge. Y ears  of deferred maintenance and funds reallocated for more pressing needs left both barracks and family housing units in uncertain condition as the Army entered the realities of post-Cold War budgets and competitive personnel markets. In response to a 1992 tri-service survey of barracks conditions, the Army launched the Whole Barracks Renewal Program, intended to remodel or replace all barracks within the United States by FY 2007, those in Europe by FY 2010, and those in South Korea by 2014. A parallel Whole Neighborhood Program targets family housing and infrastructure on Army bases, seeking to bring all family housing up to Army standards by 2010. The Army maintained its dedication to those programs during FY 1999.

Housing  is  the  Army' s  greatest  quality-of-life  issue  and  a  major incentive in attracting and retaining soldiers. During FY 1999, the Army took  significant  steps  toward  implementing  an  innovative  program  to privatize most of the Army family housing in the United States. The goal was to revitalize or replace entire family housing communities at major installations.  The  Army  issued  a  contract  for  the  construction  of  840 new  family  housing  units  and  the  renovation  of  1,823  existing  houses at Fort Carson, Colorado. The contractor assumed responsibility for the management  of  housing  operations  at  Fort  Carson  and  received  rental payments  from  the  occupants  of  family  housing  who  began  collecting the  basic  allowance  for  housing  provided  to  families  residing  off-post. Planning for pilot projects at Fort Hood (Texas), Fort Lewis (Washington), and Fort Meade (Maryland) continued, with the goal of privatizing 13,711

family housing units at those installations. These efforts employed the legal authorities enacted by Congress in the 1996 Military Housing Privatization Initiatives  Act,  which  authorized  the  services  to  attract  private-sector expertise and capital to improve military housing.

Some military housing is simply too dilapidated for economical repair. The Army demolished 620 substandard houses during the year. Removal of the substandard units releases valuable base property for new housing construction  or  environmental  restoration,  furthering  efforts  to  improve the quality of life on Army bases.

Providing  single  soldiers  with  housing  that  meets  the  one-plus-one standard is the highest priority in the Army' s current facilities development effort. The standard calls for each single soldier to have a private living and sleeping area. Two such private areas share a connecting service area, containing a small kitchen and a bathroom. The Whole Barracks Renewal Program pursues the standard by creating brigade complexes. In addition to  individual  living  space  for  a  brigade' s  single  personnel,  the  newly remodeled  or  constructed  complexes  systematically  integrate  the  dining facility, community buildings, and headquarters areas for the brigade and its component battalions and companies. During FY 1999, the Army awarded contracts to modernize 11,700 spaces to the one-plus-one standard.

## Army Safety Program

Army Safety Program analysts conclude that approximately 80 percent of Army accidents, in peace or war, are the result of human error. Safety Program personnel seek to reduce the volume and severity of such accidents through the training, technical support, and expert assistance they provide to Army commanders. Their efforts protect the Army' s ability to execute its mission and promote recruitment and retention by maintaining the safety of Army posts and facilities.

SafeForce 21 is the Army' s strategic plan for preventing personnel and materiel losses by integrating risk management into all  Army activities.  The effort begins with individual soldiers and civilians in their daily routines, and  extends  upward  through  planning  and  programming  processes. SafeForce 21 seeks to promote risk-management efforts in the development of  doctrine  and  training,  in  the  acquisition  process,  and  in  combat operations. Army Safety Information Services and Technology software, the information technology component of SafeForce 21, is being developed to transform the existing accident database into a risk-management system accessible from unit-and installation-level information systems. When the software becomes operational, it will provide Army commanders with a risk-management  information  system  capable  of  supporting  individual initiatives while promoting the Army' s overall safety program.

The  Army  Safety  Center  directs  that  overall  program,  collecting information  on  mishaps  and  issuing  advisories  about  specific  matters. Through FlightFax, Countermeasure, and the Capp Report , publications for  the  Army' s  aviation  community,  ground  community,  and  civilian workforce,  the Safety Center  promotes  awareness  of  safety issues relevant to those audiences. But unless required to do so by law or higher headquarters, the Safety Center does not impose operational restrictions. This approach differs from more traditional safety office practices, leaving responsibility  for  establishing  acceptable  levels  of  risk  and  appropriate management protocols to local commanders.

The greatest cause of accidental death among Army personnel remains the privately owned vehicle, typically outweighing even hostile action as a source of casualties. During the fiscal year, 124 soldiers died in motor vehicle  accidents. This  number  is  particularly  disturbing  because  it  has remained  nearly  constant  in  the  late  1990s,  despite  the Army' s  overall decline  in  uniformed  strength.  In  FY  1998,  personal  vehicle  accidents claimed 117 soldiers. The number of fatalities was significantly lower in FY 1997 (91), but there were 130 in FY 1996 and 116 in FY 1995.

## Army Career and Alumni Program

The Army Career and Alumni Program (ACAP) opened its doors in 1990.  Since  that  time,  the  program  has  provided  transition  counseling and assistance to active-component personnel separating from the Army. That  assistance  includes  career  guidance,  job-search  counseling,  and aid  in  identifying  benefits  and  other  programs  available  to  individual servicemembers. In cooperation with state and federal employment offices, private employers, and educational institutions, the ACAP guides soldiers making the transition to civilian  employment. The program also assists displaced civilian employees and military family members.

ACAP  programs  amount  to  far  more  than  the  expected  résumé workshops and job fairs. The programs provide counseling on the transition to civilian life, which can be disorienting after a military career. The ACAP also identifies unique opportunities for former servicemembers, including the Montgomery GI Bill's education benefits, classes offered by the Small Business Administration, and loans available through the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Troops to Teachers is the newest program for former servicemembers. Established in January 1994, it capitalizes on the fact that long-term service in the armed forces provides military personnel with valuable experience in  teaching. Troops  to Teachers  provides  funding  and  special  programs to encourage former soldiers to obtain teaching credentials and continue their public service as professional educators.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) manages retail operations on Army posts worldwide. With more than $7.1 billion in total annual  revenues-which  includes  sales  from  post  exchanges,  fast-food franchises, theaters, and personal service providers-the AAFES was the eighth largest American retailer in 1999. During its1999 fiscal year, which ran from 1 February 1999 to 29 January 2000, AAFES operations returned 67 percent of their earnings, $243.6 million, or a record $284 per soldier and airman, to support morale, welfare, and education programs. The AAFES accumulated that money by providing military personnel around the world with access to goods and services comparable to those available in small-town America. By using its earnings to support community programs, the AAFES promotes morale and the quality of life both directly and indirectly.

A  virtual  post  exchange  opened  on  the  World  Wide  Web  in  1996, beginning a new era for AAFES activities. By 1999, the initiative secured a fourth-place rating on the Information Week list of the top one hundred electronic commerce enterprises, and the General Service Administration' s Office of Intergovernment Solutions cited the Web site as one of the best government sites providing online services. Through direct Internet access and  dedicated  electronic  sales  booths  in  post  exchanges,  the  AAFES' electronic retail operation offers military personnel a substantially expanded  range  of  goods.  During  the  1998  holiday  season,  the  period of  greatest  retail  activity  in  FY  1999,  the AAFES  shifted  its  electronic commerce operations from a proprietary mainframe program to a simplified Microsoft-based system. The success of the change and of the project as a whole is clear. Internet sales continued to increase, totaling $24 million in 1999, and neither traditional catalog nor in-store sales suffered any longterm decline as a result of competition from the new service.

AAFES facilities may be found wherever the Army or the Air Force operates. In December 1998, the AAFES established field exchanges in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala , and Nicaragua to support Army and other U.S. military personnel involved in Hurricane Mitch relief efforts as part of Operation new horiZons. Another field exchange began operations in Tirana, Albania,  during April  1999  to  support  personnel  involved  in Operation noble anvil. Working from two truck trailers, the seventeen volunteer  personnel  involved  in  that  exchange  offered  peacekeepers in the Balkans an array of goods similar to those found in an American convenience store. The AAFES also offered a taste of home to soldiers in the Balkans through Burger King restaurants it opened in Camp Bondsteel (Kosovo) and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

The Joint Military Mall that the AAFES opened on Elmendorf Air Force  Base, Alaska,  in  September  1999  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the

improvised  field  facilities  in  South America  and  the  Balkans. The  new structure  is  the  centerpiece  in  the  AAFES'  plan  to  shift  toward  onestop shopping in consolidated facilities. Combining the exchanges from Elmendorf and neighboring Fort Richardson,  along  with  a  commissary and  specialty shops, the $32  million, 330,000-square-foot  building features native Alaskan architectural themes. The mall' s lighting design secured nomination for both the International Illumination Design Award and the Guth Award of the Illumination Engineering Society. Similar joint or consolidated facilities are being constructed at Fort Bliss, (Texas), Fort Jackson, (South Carolina), Fort Buchanan, (Puerto Rico), and Hanscom Air Force Base, (Massachusetts).

Hollywood and the AAFES have a long working relationship, which continued  during  1999  with  a  special  pre-release  screening  of  'Saving Private Ryan' for soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. That unit was depicted in the hugely popular World War II film. The AAFES regularly provides first-run films to overseas personnel. The newest film  in  the  Star Wars  franchise,  'The  Phantom  Menace,'  began showing on overseas bases only sixteen days after its commercial release in the United States. LucasFilms and 20th Century Fox also approved free showings  of  the  hit  movie  for  troops  deployed  in  Bosnia,  Kuwait,  and Saudi Arabia.

## Command Information

Soldiers perform better when they understand their orders and share a sense of unity and common purpose, and the nation benefits from public awareness  of  the Army' s  activities  and  mission.  With  that  in  mind,  the Army  maintains  several  programs  to  keep  its  personnel  informed  and provide information to the American public. Through the Hometown News Service, the Army Broadcast Service, Soldiers, and other publications and information  services,  Army  leaders  are  able  to  provide  information  to Army personnel and the nation they serve. These activities are directed by the Army chief of public affairs.

The Hometown News Service, a joint venture of the Army and Air Force Offices of Public Affairs, generates stories of interest for daily and weekly newspapers throughout the country. These stories enhance public awareness of the contributions of local people and organizations to the Army mission, promote soldier morale, support recruiting efforts, and generally improve civil-military relations. The Hometown News Service also  provides  audio  and  video  coverage  for  local  radio  and  television stories.  The  service' s  staff  of  forty  Army,  Air  Force,  and  civilian personnel  produced  approximately  seven  hundred  thousand  individual news releases for use by its twelve thousand print and broadcast media

subscribers during the fiscal year. That list of subscribers includes the 266  Army  newspapers  found  on  various  posts  and  installations.  The Hometown News Service's most popular product may be the 'Holiday Greetings'  television  program,  which  annually  provides  thousands of  video  greetings  from  Army  and  Air  Force  personnel  on  overseas assignment for broadcast in their home communities.

The Army Broadcast Service operates a television and radio network for U.S. military personnel serving overseas.  Through the  American Forces Network (AFN) in Europe, Honduras, Kwajalein, and South Korea, the Army makes American television and radio programs available to U.S. military personnel around the world. AFN broadcasts improve the morale of servicemembers, civilian personnel, and their dependents. Beyond that simple and important function, they also provide a convenient mechanism for circulating important information and serve as a real-time source for emergency instructions.

The AFN Europe completed its transition to digital radio broadcasting in  June  1999,  thereby  significantly  improving  the  quality  of  its  signal. More important for the Army's mission, however, was the AFN Europe's support  for  operations  in  the  Balkans. The  network  began  planning  to provide radio and television for U.S. personnel in Albania during April, and, by 29 May 1999, Tirana airport featured large-screen televisions and radio receivers in high-traffic areas. Technicians brought AFN radio to Kosovo during the same period, with satellite and direct transmissions from Camp Bondsteel and Camp Monteith.

The AFN Honduras emerged during FY 1999 as the Army continued preparations to return the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama. In 1987, the Southern Command Network (SCN) assumed responsibility for broadcast activities in Panama initiated by the Navy during contingency operations in the early 1980s. During 1991, the SCN opened a subsidiary affiliate in Honduras, which became the AFN Honduras when the SCN ceased operations as part of the withdrawal of forces from Panama. The new addition to the AFN provides radio broadcasts for Soto Cano Air Force Base as part of Joint Task Force-Bravo and is the home of the AFN Atlantic, a television broadcast contained in commercial satellite service from the United States.

Soldiers, the  official  magazine  of  the  U.S.  Army,  added  a  new feature during FY 1999. Hot Topics: Current Issues for Army Leaders is a separate insert that focuses on issues of particular interest to the Army's leaders and trainers. Its second quarterly issue, in the fall of 1999, served as a conduit for introducing the Army's new fraternization policies. By providing extended, timely commentary on such matters, Hot Topics gives the Army's leadership another means to inform and unify Army personnel.

## Army Tuition Assistance Program

The  Army  tuition  assistance  program  provides  soldiers  with  the opportunity to pursue their professional and personal educational development during off-duty hours. By providing financial assistance for such endeavors, the Army improves the skills of its workforce, promotes recruiting and retention, and reinforces its long-standing commitment to education and self-improvement. The tuition assistance program has long been one of the most popular programs offered by the Army Continuing Education System.

In  FY  1999,  a  uniform  tuition  assistance  policy  was  introduced throughout the DOD.  Active-duty  military personnel may  now  be reimbursed for 75 percent of tuition costs, up to a maximum of $187.50 per  semester-hour  or  $3,500  per  year,  to  attend  accredited  educational programs. Reimbursement is contingent on successful course completion. According to the new policy, a soldier may receive tuition assistance to repeat  a  failed  course  if  he  or  she  reimburses  the  government  for  any assistance  received  in  support  of  the  failed  course.  Although  open  to all Army personnel, the tuition assistance program is not blind to rank. Commissioned and warrant officers seeking tuition assistance are required to serve an additional two years of active duty. That obligation does not apply to enlisted personnel.

The Army offered additional educational benefits to soldiers during FY 1999. The Montgomery GI Bill is the best-known of these benefits, offering a minimum of $23,400 in college benefits after completion of a two-year enlistment. The total educational benefit available to an individual under the provisions of the Montgomery GI Bill increases with more years of service and may be supplemented by specific recruiting incentives offered through the  Army  College  Fund.  The  Army  also  offers  scholarships  to  Reserve Officers Training Corps students and, through the Green-to-Gold program, to enlisted personnel attending college to receive Army commissions.

## Army Sports Program

The Army sports program encourages soldiers to participate in athletic activities and organized competitive sports. An MWR activity, the sports program is intended to promote morale and physical fitness. Among its offerings  is  the  World-Class Athlete  Program,  which  allows  qualifying soldiers to train for some of the world' s most prestigious athletic contests.

The Army World-Class Athlete Program furnished 123 of the 312 U.S. military athletes and staff participating in the August 1999 Military World Games in Zagreb, Croatia. Similar programs from the other armed services supported  the  remaining  189  participants. The  U.S.  contingent  finished

seventh among the 82 national teams engaged in the second iteration of the quadrennial event. Army athletes won three of the American team' s eleven gold medals, four of the ten silvers, and two of the nine bronzes.

Ten  members  of  the  World-Class  Athlete  Program  represented  the United States in the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada, during July and August 1999. The program fielded three wrestlers, one boxer, one pentathlete, a handball team of two, and three track-and-field athletes. Spc. Dominic Black won the gold medal in freestyle wrestling (97 kg); Spc. Dremiel Byers took a silver in Greco-Roman wrestling (130 kg); Spc. Dan Steele received a silver in the decathlon; Spc. Brett Wetherbee won a silver in the modern pentathlon; and Spc. Glenn Nieradka took a bronze medal in Greco-Roman wrestling (60 kg).

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

Funding for active-component military construction increased substantially  between FY 1998 and FY 1999, rising from $437 million to $869 million. Army Reserve construction funding more than doubled during  the  same  period,  from  $42  million  to  $102  million.  In  contrast, the budget for National Guard construction actually decreased from $215 million  in  FY  1998  to  $142  million  for  FY  1999. The  overall  infusion of  funds  allowed  the Army  to  pursue  a  number  of  projects  against  the considerable  backlog  of  renovation  and  new  construction  requirements presented by the Army's aging infrastructure.

Base  closings  and  efforts  to  streamline  Army  operations  helped concentrate construction and facilities maintenance funds by eliminating roughly 68 million square feet of excess building space between FYs 1992 and 1999. But the resulting consolidation of facilities is a mixed blessing. Although the reduction in authorized Army strength and facilities meant an overall decrease in the number of buildings and structures requiring maintenance,  base  closures  also  increased  their  average  age  or  state  of disrepair. As a result, the Army continues to fight a holding action against the degradation of its physical plant. That struggle is clear in the reserve components, which assumed control of many existing structures from the active Army through the base realignment and closure process. Between FYs 1997 and 1999, the average age of Army National Guard structures increased by only a single year, to thirty-five years, thanks to expansion of the inventory by some 897 facilities. But the percentage of those structures considered inadequate grew from 72 to 75 in the same period. Whereas the percentage of inadequate Army Reserve facilities remained static at forty-five over the same three fiscal years, their average age grew from thirty-three years to thirty-eight years through a 28 percent expansion in the inventory, a net addition of 2,130 individual structures.

The  Army's  reserve  components  have  partially  addressed  the  mismatch between authorized construction or renovation projects and their facilities requirements through innovative solutions. Reserve enclaves formed at active-component sites closed during the base realignment and closure process enable reserve-component organizations to move from expensive leased facilities to less costly government-owned properties. In addition to the enclaves, Joint Service Reserve Component Facility Boards meet at least annually in each state to evaluate proposed reserve construction projects for potential use by the reserve components of two or more of the armed services. That effort has not greatly benefited the Army because the number of facilities its reserve components use in conjunction with another service actually decreased between FYs 1997 and 1999. The loss of three joint facilities by the Army Reserve in that period was marginal, lowering the total from ninety-four to ninety-one. In contrast, the Army National Guard's use of such facilities declined precipitously in FY 1999. During FY 1998, Guard formations gained two joint facilities over the previous year, bringing the total to 544. But by the end of FY 1999, the Guard shared the use of only 162 joint facilities, a 70 percent decline.

Military construction projects are often a source of controversy, as legislators attempt to include funding for unrequested local projects in the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. Senator John McCain (R-Az) strongly criticized the practice in a statement before the Senate during discussion of additions to the FY99 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. The  senator  identified  114  projects  within  the  bill  that  were  not requested  by  any  of  the  services,  representing  a  total  expenditure  of almost $600 million. Those projects included ten unrequested National Guard  and  Reserve  centers,  costing  a  total  of  almost  $65  million. Another $12 million was scheduled to replace dining halls at two joint civilian-military airports, at Dannelly Field (Alabama) and Fort Wayne (Indiana). In total, 95 percent of the construction projects entered into the bill by amendment were in the home states or districts of appropriations committee members. Many of them remained in the final act as approved by the legislature.

The Army  also  faced  unusual  challenges  in  facilities  management during  FY  1999.  In  August  1998,  heavy  rains  produced  severe  flood damage to several U.S. installations in South Korea. Camps Casey, Hovey, and  Red  Cloud  required  substantial  repair  and  new  construction  work when the waters receded. By 30 June 1999, the Army Corps of Engineers had awarded eight contracts to restore damaged Army facilities to normal operations.  They  included  construction  of  five  two  hundred-person barracks, four forty-eight-person  bachelor  officers'  quarters, twelve company  operations  facilities,  four  warehouses,  three  armored  vehicle maintenance facilities, and six administrative centers. Approximately fifty

Army Corps of Engineers personnel from stations in the United States and Japan volunteered to assist with the projects, primarily through thirty-day temporary-duty assignments. Many of those volunteers served more than one rotation through the recovery projects, while personnel remaining in the Corps' Engineering Division postponed leave and worked substantial overtime throughout the year to meet the projects' needs. Early in FY 1999, personnel in the Design Branch worked thirty to forty hours of overtime each pay period, developing plans for the effort.

Panama offered a challenge even more unusual than extensive flood damage. Control of the Panama Canal reverted to the Republic of Panama on  31  December  1999. As  the  last  full  fiscal  year  of  U.S.  control  over the  canal,  final  preparations  for  the  transfer  of American  facilities  and property to Panama were conducted in FY 1999. The process originated in the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, signed at a meeting of the Organization of  American  States  by  U.S.  president  Jimmy  Carter  and  Panamanian president  Omar  Torrijos.  On  1  October  1979,  operation  of  the  canal became the duty of the Panama Canal Commission, under the leadership of the former commander in chief, Southern Command, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Dennis P . McAuliffe, while the Panamanian government took control of most of the former Canal Zone.

With final transfer of the canal at 1200 hours on 31 December 1999, the  United  States  would  also  transfer  ownership  of  fourteen  military installations in the former Canal Zone. After more than twenty years of preparation,  in  March  1999  the Army  still  retained  roughly  half  of  its holdings in Panama. They included 93,000 acres of land and forty-eight hundred buildings spread over the fourteen installations. Fort Sherman, on the Atlantic side of the canal, experienced a dramatic increase in workload after the last class graduated from its Jungle Operations Training Center in March, as other units inactivated and relocated through its facilities.

U.S. Army South (USARSO) activated its new headquarters at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, in July and finalized plans for the withdrawal of Army personnel from Panama. Equipment from Army and other service facilities  that  could  not  be  relocated  for  further  use  was  transferred  to humanitarian aid groups or sold through the Defense Reutilization Office. The USARSO designated four hundred housing units as transient housing where personnel could reside for up to sixty days before departure from Panama, the estimated transit time for household goods. All dependents were  ordered  out  of  the  country  by August. The  USARSO  maintained its  theater engagement plan as the transfer process continued, including scheduled exercises, military-to-military exchanges, and humanitarian and counternarcotics operations. On the final day of FY 1999, the Army stood ready  to  complete  its  withdrawal  from  all  facilities  in  Panama  without disrupting its mission capabilities.

## Special Functions

As one of the nation' s most prominent and enduring institutions, the Army necessarily confronts a wide variety of special issues and concerns in its daily routine. Army personnel must respond to those challenges not only in the best interests of the Army and its mission, but also in a manner befitting its social responsibilities as an exemplar of government policy and good corporate citizenship. In addition to standard policies and training, the Army supports a number of dedicated efforts to address these needs.

## Environmental Protection

Corporate experience has demonstrated that cost-effective environmental  management  programs  can  reduce  the  consumption  of resources  and  protect  the  environment  without  undue  disruption  to  an enterprise' s core functions. With that lesson in mind, the Department of Defense  (DOD)  integrated  environmental  protection  into  its  decisionmaking process. The DOD's announced environmental objectives are to protect people, manage properties judiciously, promote good citizenship, and set an example for the world' s military forces. The Army pursues those objectives in its daily operations, aided by dedicated programs.

In FY 1999, the  Army received $1.56 billion to support environmental quality and restoration and related technology development efforts. Only a  slight  decline  from  the  $1.59  billion  dedicated  to  such  tasks  in  FY 1998, that funding level permitted the Army to maintain its environmental efforts  despite  escalating  costs. The  U.S. Army  Environmental  Center (USAEC) continued its campaign to contain those costs while sustaining readiness  and  environmental  stewardship.  By  finding  new  ways  to maintain training areas, preventing pollution at Army installations, and developing cost-effective strategies for meeting environmental standards, the USAEC's efforts directly contributed to the Army's ability to achieve its mission goals.

As a field operating agency of the assistant chief of staff for installation management,  the  USAEC  coordinates,  promotes,  and  supports  the Army's environmental programs under the leadership of the director of

environmental programs. With direct control over only $67.6 million of the Army's $1.56 billion environmental budget and another $17.1 million in reimbursable programs in FY 1999, USAEC activities produced longterm savings of more than $180 million during the year. The remainder of the Army's environmental budget was divided among various commands, which  seek  to  meet  individual  goals  with  the  USAEC' s  oversight  and technical support.

The USAEC improved its capacity to provide that oversight and support during the fiscal year. In FY 1999, the independent technical review (ITR) program expanded to include active installations. The ITR began in 1997 as part of the base realignment and closure (BRAC) process, dispatching teams of specialists to evaluate independently  Army environmental cleanup projects  at  inactivated  facilities.  The  multidisciplinary  teams  sought  to reduce the cost and time associated with environmental restoration while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and agreements.

The program's expansion paid rapid dividends. ITR teams evaluated eleven active installations during the fiscal year. Their recommendations at just five of those installations identified more than $80 million in longterm savings. ITR experts also assessed efforts at eight posts undergoing the  BRAC  process  during  the  year.  In  addition,  the  teams  returned  to several previously evaluated sites to assist with implementation of earlier recommendations.

At Fort Gillem, Georgia, an ITR team' s recommendations contributed to a $44 million decrease in the estimated cost of environmental cleanup efforts.  Familiar  with  such  results,  the  leaders  of  the  Badger  Army Ammunition Plant in Wisconsin summoned assistance from ITR experts when they received an estimate of $166 million for the planned excavation and treatment of explosives-contaminated soil at two sites on the facility. Their  revised  plan,  limiting  the  depth  of  excavation  based  on  the  low long-term threat posed by the site, reduced that estimate by $140 million. The ITR teams' effectiveness at those two active sites is indicative of the program's potential.

The lessons learned by ITR assessments are posted on the USAEC Web site and published through various media to guide the Army' s future efforts. To guarantee that the Army reaps the full benefits of experience garnered  through  the  ITR,  the  USAEC  also  began  hosting  workshops on principles of environmental restoration. These workshops help Army program managers, regulators, and other interested parties outline goals and strategies for installation cleanup projects.

Sound strategies make a significant difference in the cost effectiveness of restoration efforts.  The USAEC' s Groundwater Extraction and  Treatment Effectiveness Review program helps installations find alternatives to the expensive and lengthy process of pumping out and treating contaminated

groundwater.  Some  installations  failed  to  consider  other  options  when they  initially  began  addressing  the  problem  of  groundwater  pollution. The USAEC estimates that the Army could save $100 million during the next  decade  by  optimizing  existing  groundwater  treatment  efforts  and establishing more rational objectives.

Preventing further environmental damage is a sure way to reduce the cost of future clean-up requirements. The Army made a significant step in that direction during FY 1999 with the production and use of the first 'green ammunition.' New 5.56-mm rounds that replaced the traditional lead  bullet  core  with  tungsten-nylon  entered  the  Army  inventory.  That change in the Army's standard rifle ammunition, part of a comprehensive effort  to  make  all  DOD  ammunition  more  environmentally  friendly, eliminates the expense of removing heavy and potentially hazardous lead from the soil of Army ranges. As an added benefit, the new rounds are slightly more accurate than their predecessors and produce less erosion in weapon barrels over time. The USAEC continued working with the Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center to develop lead-free versions of other rounds and reduce the usage of toxic substances employed in the manufacturing process.

Those efforts also support Range XXI, the partnership between the Army's environmental, training, and materiel-development communities to promote the cost-effective management  of firing ranges while conducting realistic training. Nontoxic ammunition is only one of Range XXI's environmental concerns. The USAEC worked with the Aberdeen Test Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and the West Desert Test  Center  at  Dugway  Proving  Ground,  Utah,  to  identify  and  quantify the chemical emissions of more than twenty weapons, pyrotechnics, and projectiles during FY 1999. The data collected will help the Army address regulatory concerns with scientific fact, limiting potential restrictions on training and protecting soldiers' health.

USAEC scientists also cooperated with the Army Engineer Research and Development Center's Waterways Experiment Station to test a new technology  for  controlling  erosion  and  reducing  lead  contamination  on Army ranges. Shock-absorbing concrete, a recyclable, low-density, fiberreinforced  foamed  concrete  composite,  is  designed  to  trap  bullets. The new  material  offers  a  cost-effective  means  of  preventing  bullets  from accumulating in the soil of busy ranges while it controls erosion. The result is more flexibility in range use without the sacrifice of training realism or environmental quality.

On another front, the  Army met the Environmental Protection Agency' s December 1998 deadline to upgrade existing underground storage tanks by  installing  devices  to  prevent  leaks  and  spills. The  USAEC  played  a large role in supporting the Army' s efforts to remove or upgrade more than

seven thousand storage tanks. The Environmental Compliance Assessment System,  managed  by  the  USAEC,  helps  facility  commanders  monitor compliance with such requirements and identify potential problems as they emerge. Those efforts protect the environment, improve local quality of life, and prevent the loss of Army appropriations through costly paperwork and fines.

The  1990  Clean Air Act  threatened  the  Army  with  such  expenses early  in  FY  1999.  Before  the  act' s  June  1999  implementation  deadline, according  to  a  USAEC  survey,  fifty-four  Army  installations  had  to prepare risk-management plans against the possible accidental release of hazardous materials. After fully exploring the legislation' s requirements, the USAEC was able to help thirty installations eliminate the need for riskmanagement plans by reducing their supplies of targeted chemicals. That saved the Army $1 million, and compliance with the resulting plans will reduce the threat of accidents at the remaining installations.

The  USAEC  also  helps  the  Army  shape  and  interpret  local  and federal  environmental  legislation.  In  Colorado,  a  new  state  law  strictly limiting airborne emissions from federal facilities would have had serious consequences  for  Army  activities  in  the  state.  The  USAEC' s  Western Regional Environmental Office teamed with other services to demonstrate to state legislators that the DOD' s emissions-control activities already met or  exceeded  federal  requirements.  The  effectiveness  of  those  activities convinced  the  bill' s  sponsors  to  exempt  military  activities,  saving  the DOD $16 million in initial costs and $1.6 million in annual reporting and maintenance costs.

Many states required guidance on implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's 1997 Military Munitions Rule before deciding how to implement it or incorporate its provisions into state laws. The Army' s regional  environmental  coordinators  held  briefings  and  workshops  for regulators and lawmakers across the country during FY 1999 in an effort to  explain  the  rule  and  its  importance  in  supporting  military  readiness. Consistent and rapid adoption of the rule, which classifies some expended or surplus munitions as a form of solid hazardous waste and governs the handling of such waste, will permit the Army to continue realistic training without significant disruption or additional regulatory costs. By the end of FY 1999, the rule was fully adopted by twenty-one states. Four other states adopted it with amendments.

The Army guarantees that its leadership is informed about developing federal, state, and local environmental legislation through the USAEC' s Environmental  Legislative  and  Regulatory  Analysis  and  Monitoring Program (EL/RAMP). During FY 1999. the EL/RAMP's ability to track regulatory development was enhanced through significant refinement of its  primary analysis and reporting tools, the Semiannual Report System

and the Final List of Regulatory Actions. The USAEC also worked with the  Army  Secretariat  and  various  Army  Staff  components  to  develop standard EL/RAMP operating procedures, prescribing specific tasks each client requires from the program, to streamline and improve its ability to communicate issues up the chain of command.

The  USAEC  also  helped  produce  a  draft  DOD  Interim  Land  Use Controls Policy during the fiscal year. The policy distinguishes between remedies prescribed by the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (more commonly known as the environmental Superfund) and other restoration efforts. Land use controls, administrative measures limiting access to contaminated areas, provide a cost-effective tool in the BRAC process. Restoring a former military site to the Environmental Protection Agency's stringent residential standards makes little economic sense if the BRAC process designates it for industrial development,  a  use  with  less  stringent  environmental  controls  and  one that is likely to reverse the results of restoration to residential standards. By ensuring that the exposure assumptions governing site assessment are consistent with a site' s future use, the policy avoids unnecessarily expensive restoration efforts while it protects the environment and public health.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The  Army  gains  access  to  the  innovation  and  efficiency  of  small companies  through  the  Small  and  Disadvantaged  Business  Utilization (SADBU) program, bringing the ideals of equal opportunity advocated in  other  activities  into  the  realms  of  contracting  and  procurement. The SADBU  made  substantial  progress  during  the  fiscal  year,  once  again expanding  the  roll  of  small  and  disadvantaged  businesses  in  Army procurement and the Army's association with historically black colleges and minority institutions.

The first preferential Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB-Zone)  contracts  were  created  in  FY  1999.  The  Small  Business Reauthorization  Act  of  1997  established  the  HUBZone  Empowerment Contracting  program  under  the  auspices  of  the  U.S.  Small  Business Administration. The program supports economic development in HUBZones through systematic preferences in federal contracts, including the Army's SADBU efforts. On 4 January 1999, the provisions of the 1997 act were implemented through the interim Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAC 97-10, FAR Case 97-307.

Under that regulation, small businesses in regions of high poverty or unemployment gain preferential federal contracts if their bid is no more than  10  percent  higher  than  the  lowest  valid  bid  received.  Firms  must be  pre-certified  to  take  advantage  of  the  program,  demonstrating  that

their  workforce  and  principal  office  reside  within  a  HUBZone.  Under definitions current in FY 1999, these zones are located in approximately seven  thousand  urban  census  tracts,  nine  hundred  rural  counties,  and defined  Native American tribal  areas. The  program  promotes  economic development and employment growth in these financially troubled areas.

During FY 1999, the  Army awarded 27.4 percent of its total  procurement funds to small businesses. That percentage surpassed DOD expectations for prime contracts awarded to small businesses, equating to more than $7.9 billion. Small disadvantaged businesses received $2.8 billion from the Army, approximately 35 percent of that amount.

Army  participation  in  the  DOD' s  Pilot  Mentor-Protégé  Program (MPP) helped generate that success. Through the MPP , prime contractors serve  as  mentors  to  small  and  disadvantaged  businesses,  guiding  their entry into the DOD marketplace. The MPP provides mentor firms with credit toward small and disadvantaged business subcontracting goals or cost  reimbursement  in  exchange  for  their  participation.  By  the  end  of FY 1999, the Army has approved forty-eight mentor-protégé agreements across a broad range of industries, including environmental restoration, manufacturing, telecommunications, and health care.

In  FY  1999,  the  Army  took  the  MPP  a  step  beyond  the  DOD program through its Graduate Pilot Mentor-Protégé Program. Under this arrangement, firms graduating from the Small Business Administration' s 8(a)  program  for  socially  and  economically  disadvantaged  businesses, including the MPP , and other successful small and disadvantaged firms serve as mentors to emerging 8(a) Army contractors. The Army received a  waiver  to  allow  up  to  ten  8(a)  contractors  to  serve  as  mentors  in  the program without the subcontracting plan normally required by the DOD. Nine mentor-protégé agreements under the new program helped the Army rank first among the services in total percentage of funds awarded through the small business program.

Army  contracts  also  embraced  historically  black  colleges  and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MIs) under objectives the Army established in cooperation with the DOD during FY 1994. Those objectives are an increase in the number of research centers on HBCU/ MI  campuses;  expanded  HBCU/MI  participation  in  Army  research programs, particularly among smaller institutions; greater opportunities for  the  HBCU/MIs  to  participate  in  training,  education,  and  research activities; and increased subcontracting at the HBCU/MIs by the Army's prime contractors.

During FY 1999, the Army awarded forty-three research contracts of varying types, totaling $4.7 million, to twenty-three HBCUs. That funding level represents a $1.4 million growth over the previous year. Research grants  to  the  HBCUs  increased  by  $700,000,  reaching  $6  million.

The  eighteen  grants  divided  that  sum  among  twelve  recipient  schools. Researchers at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia, received the most  support-$1.1  million.  Howard  University  in  Washington,  D.C., received $477,000 in research grants; Alabama A&amp;M in Huntsville won $264,000; and Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, received the fourth-largest grant, $260,000.

The Army began recording figures for contracts with Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in FY 1998. During FY 1999, two additional HSIs began participating in Army contracting and grant programs, thus expanding the total to fourteen schools. The research contracts and grants they received totaled $10 million. The Army Materiel Command provided an additional $3.3 million to New Mexico State University under a contract awarded in FY 1998.

Three Native American tribal colleges also participated in the Army HBCU/MI program during FY 1999. Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, Montana,  continued  to  perform  archeological  research  and  records management  services  at  Montana' s  Libby  Dam  for  $35,758  under  the second  of  four  option  years  of  a  Corps  of  Engineers  contract.  Haskell Indian  Nations  University,  in  Lawrence,  Kansas,  received  a  research contract  worth  $68,990.  Stone  Child  College  in  Box  Elder,  Montana, received a research grant for $37,590. This marks a 75 percent increase in tribal college funding over FY 1998' s only award ($34,995 for Salish Kootenai's activities at Libby Dam).

## Legal Affairs

The  Office  of  the  Judge  Advocate  General  (OTJAG)  provides  the Army with legal services and oversees its system of military justice. From three hundred offices in the United States and sixteen foreign countries, 1,450 active-component and 2,700 reserve-component OTJAG attorneys directed  those  complex  and  important  efforts  during  the  fiscal  year. Over the previous five fiscal years, the OTJAG has suffered a 41 percent decrease in officer accessions, despite a 25 percent increase in the number of  commissions offered. OTJAG attorneys at the grade of captain have also left the Army in great numbers in recent years, thereby increasing the need for replacements in a difficult recruiting climate. Approximately 73 percent of the officers leaving active duty with the OTJAG in FYs 1998 and 1999 cited financial pressure caused by student loans as the primary reason for their decisions. With an average of 3.8 years in service, departing judge advocate officers received salary offers from $69,100 to $112,000 per year, with an average of $77,600.

The  OTJAG  processed  1,045  courts-martial,  including  342  special courts-martial authorized to dispense bad conduct discharges, during FY

1999. Both figures represent an increase over the previous fiscal year' s 972 total and 273 bad conduct special courts-martial. FY 1998 appears to have had unusually low courts-martial rates and correspondingly higher rates of nonjudicial punishment, however. With that exception, comparing the rate of general courts-martial and nonjudicial punishment per thousand activecomponent soldiers for FY 1999 with the same figures for the preceding six years reveals fairly consistent disciplinary rates. Those figures appear in Table 19.

table 19-DisCipline rates per 1,000 members: FY 1993 through FY 1999

| Form of Discipline     |   FY 1993 |   FY 1994 |   FY 1995 |   FY 1996 |   FY 1997 |   FY 1998 |   FY 1999 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| General court-martial  |      2.2  |      2.19 |      2.25 |      2.32 |      2.24 |      2.01 |      2.23 |
| Nonjudicial punishment |     75.42 |     75    |     73.64 |     74.18 |     82.21 |     85.62 |     77.24 |

Two  of  the  courts-martial  convened  in  FY  1999  were  particularly noteworthy.  In  December  1998,  a  joint  commander  ordered  an  Army court-martial in Germany to hear charges against a soldier, only the second time in the Army' s history that the convening authority for a court-martial was  an  officer  in  another  service.  In  the  second  notable  case,  retired Maj. Gen. David R. E. Hale became the first general officer in all of the armed  services  to  be  court-martialed  since  1952  and  only  the  second since World War II. Charges were filed against the general on 9 December 1998 after a year-long investigation. On 17 March 1999, Maj. Gen. Hale appeared before a military judge and pleaded guilty to one specification of making a false official statement and seven specifications of conduct unbecoming an officer. The offenses involved inappropriate relationships with the spouses of four of his subordinates. By pretrial agreement, the sentence was limited to forfeiture of $1,000 pay per month for a full year, a reprimand, and a $10,000 fine. Courts-martial cannot reduce an officer' s grade, but federal law states that officers are retired at the highest grade in which they served satisfactorily. Subsequent investigation by a grade determination review board found that Hale had last served satisfactorily as a brigadier general. On 2 September 1999, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera ordered his reduction to that rank, retroactive to the general' s 1 March 1998 retirement.

In  FY  1999,  another  general  officer,  Maj.  Gen.  John  J.  Maher  III, became the first Army general subjected to nonjudicial punishment since 1981.  The  general  was  found  guilty  of  two  specifications  of  conduct

unbecoming an officer and one specification of attempted fraternization with  an  enlisted  soldier  during  a  nonjudicial  punishment  hearing  in September 1999. He received a reprimand and forfeited $4,316 in pay per month for two months. Maher submitted a retirement request in September, but in response to the Hale case the secretary of defense had instituted a  new  retirement  policy  in  October  1998.  Under  that  policy,  the Army no  longer  honors  retirement  requests  from  officers  under  investigation without careful review. Secretary Caldera directed a grade determination review board to convene on 1 October 1999 to recommend the appropriate grade for Maher's retirement.

The OTJAG pursued 250 more informal equal employment opportunity complaints in FY 1999 than it did in the previous year, but the number of formal complaints declined by one hundred. Army civilians continued  to  file  complaints  for  alleged  discrimination  based  on  race, color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  and  disability. The  number  of such  complaints  addressed  by  alternative  dispute  resolution  procedures more  than  quadrupled  over  FY98  levels  as  the  OTJAG  worked  with specialists at Headquarters, Department of the Army, and at the DOD to develop an Army-wide program for mediation and dispute resolution. The effectiveness of those efforts accounts, in part, for the reduction in formal complaints.

During FY 1999, the OTJAG's Procurement Fraud Division opened 206 new cases involving fraud or irregularity in Army procurement. The new cases, a 25 percent reduction from the number of new cases in FY 1998, left a total of 560 active cases at the end of the year. The Procurement Fraud  Division  pursues  a  broad  range  of  activities,  from  prosecuting corrupt federal employees and contractors to investigating the failure of critical  parts  procured  under  major  contracts. The  steady  decline  in  the number of new procurement fraud cases filed continued in FY 1999.

Legal  assistance  services  are  tracked  by  calendar  rather  than  fiscal year. During the 1998 calendar year, which ended during FY 1999, family law advice displaced estate advice as the primary service sought by Army personnel.  During  1998,  the  OTJAG  recorded  a  27  percent  increase  in marital  separation  agreements  prepared.  Other  comparisons  with  1997 figures showed similar results: a 20 percent growth in notary services, 17 percent growth in the number of powers of attorney, and 6 percent growth in  wills. At  the  same  time,  the  5,456  referrals  the  OTJAG  provided  to civilian attorneys more than doubled 1997' s total of 2,150.

Beyond  adjudicating  cases  and  providing  legal  assistance,  OTJAG personnel assist in implementing and revising military law and procedures. During FY 1999, the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice (JSC) completed its fifteenth annual review of the Manual for Courts-Martial, with input by lawyers from each service. The JSC review proposed changes in

the manual to correspond with the civilian provisions of the Victim' s Rights and  Restitution Act  of  1990.  Under  the  proposed  revision,  victims  who may testify during sentencing for a court-martial may not be excluded from the court room during other phases of criminal proceedings. The JSC also suggested changes in a military judge' s authority to issue protective orders, and provided guidance on when adulterous conduct becomes prejudicial to good order and discipline. Other proposed changes increased the monetary thresholds for the maximum punishments for some offenses and expanded the  maximum penalty for selling  captured  or  abandoned  property  when firearms or explosive devices are used in relation to the offense.

The  OTJAG  continued  to  implement  congressional  mandates  and DOD  policy  regarding  victim  and  witness  assistance.  Following  the success of the first on-site victim and witness assistance training program (held at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 25 September 1998), the OTJAG offered training programs at fourteen large Army posts in the continental United States and at locations in Hawaii, Germany, and Korea during FY 1999. The curriculum at these seminars, which hosted up to 270 participants, included victim and witness notification requirements, post-trial procedures involving prisoners, and treatment and compensation programs.

Army attorneys faced many challenges as U.S. forces  continued  to withdraw from Panama. A large number of legal issues emerged as the November 1999 deadline for the transfer of military facilities approached. These  issues  included  Panama' s  initial  refusal  to  accept  ranges  after the  removal  of  unexploded  ordnance;  continued  U.S.  control  of  the Veteran' s Cemetery in Panama; transfer of property to the Panama Canal Commission; and issues related to criminal jurisdiction, family support, and child custody.

The relocation of forces from Panama to Puerto Rico focused attention on a long-standing dispute over application of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil  Relief Act  of  1940. Authorities  in Puerto  Rico  ultimately  agreed to  exempt  military  personnel  from  property  taxes. Army  attorneys  also continued to ensure that the relocation and related construction programs complied with all applicable laws, including those related to historic and environmental preservation.

## Inspector General Activities

The  inspector  general  (IG)  and  the  U.S.  Army  Inspector  General Agency  conduct  investigations  into  the  discipline,  efficiency,  economy, morale,  training,  and  readiness  of  the  Army.  During  FY  1999,  the  IG received  1,993  Inspector  General  Action  Requests  (IGARs),  a  slight increase over FY 1998' s 1,854. Requests for assistance from both military and civilian personnel in the Department of the Army made up two-thirds

of  the  case  load,  with  1,317  individual  inspections. The  remaining  676 IGARs  resulted  from  direct  allegations  from  various  sources.  The  IG substantiated 215 (32 percent) of those allegations, could not substantiate 421 (62 percent), and in 40 cases (6 percent) could neither substantiate nor refute the alleged problem.

Inquiries  and  investigations  by  the  IG  originate  from  a  number  of sources.  The  DOD  Hotline  for  fraud,  waste,  abuse  of  authority,  and mismanagement produced 487 IGARs in FY 1999. Allegations of reprisals against internal complainants in violation of the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, revised in 1998, continued to fall. The IG received only thirty-seven  IGARs  alleging  whistleblower  retaliation  in  FY  1999,  a decrease  from  the  previous  fiscal  year' s  forty-four  The.  IG  undertook fifteen  actions  at  presidential  request,  one  less  than  FY  1998' s  sixteen presidential IGARs. Congress increased its use of the IG by seven IGARs, producing ninety-six during the fiscal year. The senior leadership of the Army and the DOD, however, expanded their demands on the IG at a faster rate. In FY 1999, those sources produced sixty-one IGARs, twelve more than in the previous year.

Most IGARs originating in FY 1999 fell into one of six functional categories.  Personal  conduct  issues,  including  sexual  harassment,  racial discrimination, and nonsupport of family, accounted for 561 (28 percent of the total) of the year' s IGARs. Another 362 (18 percent) addressed the command and management of Army organizations. These actions involved command attention to soldiers and family members, property handling, and the exercise of command influence, among other concerns. Military personnel management issues, including recruiting, reassignments, evaluations, promotions, separations, awards, and decorations, drove 301 (15 percent) of the IGARs in FY 1999. Civilian personnel management issues  added  186  (9  percent)  additional  IGARs.  Health  care  concerns, including  medical  evaluation  boards,  medical  staff  attitude  complaints, medical  records,  and  the  DOD Tricare  system,  produced  95  IGARs  (5 percent).  The  final  major  category,  acquisition,  raised  questions  about policies  and  procedures,  contract  administration  and  surveillance,  and competition. Those 84 IGARs accounted for 4 percent of the total number of requests The. IG actions addressing concerns beyond those six major categories accounted for the remaining 404 FY99 IGARs.

The IG's Investigations Division also received allegations against 698 general officers, Senior Executive Service and other civilian employees, and officials in high-visibility positions during the fiscal year. Abuse of authority was the most common complaint. The division completed fiftyfive  formal  investigations  and  133  preliminary  inquiries  against  the  accused. Those proceedings substantiated only 14 percent of the 188 allegations.

To ensure the Inspector General Agency' s continued ability to exercise

its  various  functions,  the  Training  Division  conducted  nine  inspector general  courses.  The  three-week  courses  qualified  502  students  in  IG functions:  240  Army  officers,  200  Army  noncommissioned  officers, 44 Army civilians,  and  18  students  from  other  services. Two  one-week refresher courses prepared thirty-one more personnel for their roles with the IG, thus promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Army.

## The Year 2000 Computer Problem

The approach of 1 January 2000 posed a potential threat to the world' s information systems, including those belonging to the United States Army. Variously referred to as the Millennium Bug, the Y ear 2000 Challenge, or simply the Y2K problem, the threat originated in the method that many computer operating systems and programs use to handle dates. From the origins of the computer age through the mid-1990s, software developers commonly abbreviated years as their final two digits to reduce memory requirements and increase computing efficiency. Given the rapid advances in information technology, programmers had little reason to question the convention,  assuming  that  new  equipment  and  software  would  replace their  creations  long  before  the  last  year  of  the  twentieth  century  could compromise  them.  But  the  convention  persisted  in  some  software  and operating systems, along with older computer systems and databases that proved too expensive to replace or too labor intensive to re-create.

Information systems designed for use with two-digit dates are unable to distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000, rendering both as '00.' Although at its core this was a simple problem, the magnitude of its potential consequences  and  the  efforts  required  to  avert  them  were  staggering. Without intervention, each system using the shortened date system would respond  to  the  year  2000  based  upon  its  unique  provisions,  perhaps  in unpredictable  ways.  In  the  civilian  sphere,  uncorrected  accounting  and banking systems faced potentially widespread errors or outright failures. Power  grids,  emergency  dispatch  centers,  transportation  schedules,  and traffic  control  systems  faced  possibly  crippling  disruptions.  Problems were already occurring as systems began to encounter dates including the year 2000. Some automated inventory-control systems, for example, were trying to ship perishable items with expiration dates in 2000 ahead of items with earlier dates because '00' comes before '99.'

Army  information  systems  confronted  identical  problems  plus  two additional burdens. As the calendar turned to 1 January 2000, the Army had  to  maintain  its  foreign  mission  readiness  and  be  able  to  support domestic  civil  authorities  facing  emergencies  arising  from Y2K-related systems  failures.  Meeting  the  challenge  required  efforts  from  every information system user, coordinated and supported at every level of the

chain of command. The DOD was treating the Y2K threat as a cyber attack directed at the core of American military capabilities: the ability to obtain, process, and control the information that enables U.S. forces to dominate the battlefield.

The scope and complexity of the DOD's required defense against Y2K eclipsed those facing any other federal institution. More than a third of the federal government's mission-critical information systems were located in the DOD. On 14 September 1998, a DOD memorandum barred further growth of the problem by ordering contracting officers to cease obligating funds or initiating procurement procedures for any non-Y2K-compliant system  after  the  end  of  FY  1998. The  same  memorandum  required  all services and agencies to report to the secretary of defense before 1 October 1999  the Y2K  compliance  of  systems  scheduled  for  acquisition  during the new fiscal year. The FY99 Omnibus and Supplemental Spending Bill signed by President Clinton on 21 October 1998 included $1.1 billion to fund the DOD's continued Y2K preparation efforts.

Many of the federal government's critical systems were included in the twenty-five thousand information systems the Army needed to prepare for the end of the calendar year. Microprocessors in six hundred thousand additional devices, ranging from communications and medical equipment to precision-guided munitions, had to be prepared and tested to guarantee their  continued  mission  readiness.  The  Army  effort  to  prevent  Y2K problems consumed $600 million-over half of all DOD Y2K preparation funds-during FY 1999.

Army Operations Order 99-1, Millennium Passage, issued in January 1999, emphasized the effort' s importance.  The order outlined the remaining preventive  actions  and  contingency  preparations  the  Army  needed  to complete  before  31  December  1999.  The  remedial  process  had  begun much earlier, with a 1996 Army Acquisition Executive policy memo and the release of the Army Y2K Management Plan in October of that year. Activities under Army Operations Order 99-1 marked the culmination of three years of effort.

By  early  1999,  many  Army  computer  systems  had  already  been prepared, checked, and certified ready for the year 2000. Installation and garrison commanders had designated personnel and resources to execute Y2K  preparation  programs.  Those  local  personnel  coordinated  their activities through the Army Y2K Project Office, physically located in the Army Information Integration and Analysis Center at the Pentagon but directly accessible through a dedicated Web page. Major commands and field activities promoted specific efforts and programs through their chains of command, within the framework of the larger Y2K program. Under the director of information systems for command, control, communications, and computers (DISC4), the Y2K Project Office implemented the DOD

approach of centralized policy and decentralized execution.

The Army Y2K Management Plan originally specified 31 December 1998 as the final date for completion of all required preparations, but the task proved too complex to meet that goal. Changing one system can have consequences elsewhere in an information network, requiring certification of each minor change by large-scale testing. On 9 December 1998, the DISC4 led  the  fourth  operational  evaluation  of Army Y2K  preparation efforts-the  first  of  several  evaluations  conducted  during  FY  1999  as the  pace  of  final  preparations  accelerated.  The  evaluations  extended beyond purely Army or DOD systems to address cooperation with, and the concerns of, local communities. Some Army posts share utilities with neighboring communities, and a large population of uniformed, civilian, and retired personnel live near Army facilities. For those reasons the Y2K preparedness of surrounding communities had to be considered in Army planning. Continued investigative efforts identified areas requiring further improvement as the year progressed.

For  example,  a  series  of  tests  conducted  between  7  June  and  23 July 1999 assessed the Army personnel system's preparedness for Y2K. Within that period, six testing windows enabled the Army' s information technology specialists and personnel systems end users to reset calendars throughout entire information networks. By entering two critical dates, 1 January 2000 and the leap day of 29 February 2000, in a total of more than thirty-two thousand date fields, examiners verified the networks' capability to execute 106 critical transactions. Those transactions allowed end-to-end testing of fifteen different information threads, such as the processing of a new recruit from accession, through the creation of a base record and initial pay receipt, to training and first assignment. Such threads in turn supported six mission-critical Army personnel functions. The Army Audit Agency provided independent validation of these tests and of other tests organized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Continued analysis of the Y2K challenge and the Army's readiness to meet various contingencies also required clarifying the level of support that civilian authorities facing  Y2K-related crises could expect. Under the DOD Year 2000 Consequence Management Plan, the Army's director of military support  (DOMS)  was  charged  with  providing  domestic  contingency support.  But  in  February  1999,  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  John  J. Hamre emphasized that the military's defensive mission took precedence over civilian support and was not to be compromised by such activities. The DOMS clarified that position even further in August, warning civil authorities  that  requests  for  assistance  for Y2K-related  problems  might well be refused.

As the Army completed its preparations, it shared information with the other services, joint commanders, and defense agencies. The DOD

assembled information from all of those sources in its Y2K database, the official source for status reports to senior officials and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB coordinated  Y2K preparation efforts throughout the government. A partial exemption from the standard DOD Y2K reporting process was granted to the intelligence community, which maintained a separate database and independently reported its  Y2K progress  to  Congress  and  the  OMB.  Declassified  summaries  of  those intelligence reports were incorporated in the primary DOD database to provide a central picture of all DOD preparations without compromising security.

Plans called for the activation of an Army Y2K Transition Operations Cell in the Pentagon between 28 December 1999 and 4 January 2000, and again  around  the  Leap Y ear  rollover  period  of  26  February  to  2  March 2000. Similar cells in the major commands reported their status and any incidents to the Pentagon cell, allowing the Army to address issues as they arose. The Army Transition Operations Cell in turn reported to the DOD Y2K Operations Center, thus ensuring coordination at all command levels as transition issues arose.

This  elaborate  planning  and  preparation  effort,  and  the  centralized assessment  and  control  of  information  systems  it  encouraged,  offered the Army additional benefits. In compliance with a March 1997 directive from the chief of staff,  General  Dennis  J.  Reimer,  the Army  used Y2K preparation processes to reduce the number of information systems in its inventory. Eliminating unnecessary systems, consolidating functions, and rationalizing the Army' s computing capabilities improved operational and fiscal performance. The mechanism developed to coordinate the response to Y2K as a cyber attack also improved the Army's ability to deal with more malevolent threats to information security.

By  the  end  of  FY  1999,  the  Army  had  nearly  completed  its preparations for the transition to 2000. The potential problems associated with Y2K provided the Army with an increased sense of its dependence on  information  systems  and  their  vulnerability  to  various  hazards.  In formulating a coherent response strategy and implementation mechanism, the Army also prepared itself to meet future challenges to its increasingly vital information infrastructure.

## Conclusion

The reforms initiated by Secretary of Defense Les Aspin' s Bottom-Up Review continued to guide  Army policies in FY 1999. With the United States enjoying  sustained  economic  growth;  low  unemployment;  and  unrivaled diplomatic, military, and technological preeminence, the Army capitalized on  the  opportunity  to  further  its  preparations  for  the  challenges  of  the twenty-first century. Those preparations, clarified and reinforced through the development of a new Army Vision, did not require major adjustments or the initiation of bold new programs during the fiscal year. FY 1999 was a year of transition in which the Army pursued the development of Force XXI from the existing Army of the Cold War era through previously established processes.  Soldiers  remained  on  point  for  the  nation  as  those  processes unfolded, responding to challenges as they arose.

And challenges did arise. Two major storms wreaked havoc through the Caribbean within a month of each other, the first ending just as FY 1999 began. Hurricanes Georges and Mitch left twin swaths of destruction reaching  from  Honduras  to  the  states  of  Mississippi,  Louisiana,  and Florida.  While  they  provided  humanitarian  assistance  following  those natural  disasters, soldiers continued  their  peacekeeping  missions  in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Kosovo,  and  the  Persian  Gulf.  In  preparation  for the December 1999 surrender of full control of the Panama Canal to the Republic  of  Panama,  the Army  withdrew  from  that  nation  after  almost a  century. The  approach  of  the  year  2000  also  brought  with  it  a  threat to  the Army' s  information  systems. As  the Army  faced  these  and  other challenges, it struggled with a limited budget and ongoing recruiting and retention difficulties.

A budget decrease of less than 1 percent from the previous year left $64 billion in the FY99 Army appropriation. That amount proved sufficient to fund the approved 3.1 percent raise in military pay despite an essentially unchanged  $2.6  billion  pay  allocation,  thanks  in  part  to  a  seventy-five hundred- person decline in the authorized strength of the active Army. But the  remaining  active-component  personnel,  nearly  480,000  strong,  and the 564,000 soldiers of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve still lacked adequate resources to fully address the maintenance backlog, aging

equipment, and declining physical plant that persisted as a threat to their operational readiness.  The  Army continued to promote new efficiencies and improved practices to better meet its needs with the available resources.

The Army Enterprise Strategy promotes information technology, one of the three axes of the Force XXI campaign, as a means of improving both operational readiness and the efficiency of the business practices and command, control, communications, and intelligence functions that support it. Such efficiency measures, and the savings they produce, are becoming increasingly  important  in  the  austere  post-Cold  War  budget  climate. The Army's FY99 efforts to expand and improve its use of information networks  and  computer  technology  in  pursuit  of  the  Army  Enterprise Strategy included development  of the Joint Network  Management System. Originally approved by the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Requirements Board in October 1998, the system's development stalled for the rest of the year pending completion of another assessment of its interoperability and other key performance parameters.

Preventive measures and contingency preparations for Y2K required the  efforts  of  information  systems  experts  and  leaders  at  all  command levels during FY 1999. While countering the hazard the new year posed to its information systems, the Army gained both valuable experience in mounting a systematic response to a digital threat and a new appreciation for the possibilities of cyber warfare. By the end of the fiscal year, the  Army had nearly completed its efforts to prepare for the troublesome and swiftly approaching date change, a substantial improvement over the approximately 50  percent  compliance  with Y2K  standards  reported  for  critical  Army information systems in October 1998. This result was achieved through the close cooperation of all command levels, with central coordination but substantial allowance for local initiative and responsibility.

A similar strategy of centralized policy coordination and decentralized execution  emerged  in  the  newly  created  National  Domestic  Preparedness Office  (NDPO).  Originally  established  as  a  DOD-led  working  group  supported by the Army, the NDPO' s transfer to the Department of Justice ended several months of internal struggle for leadership of the interagency office. In its first full fiscal year of existence, the NDPO began to synchronize and improve the federal government' s ability to respond to the domestic use of weapons of mass destruction, using the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  and  the  Departments  of Energy, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Defense.

The strategic and budgetary guidance originally provided by the 1993 Bottom-Up Review ended with FY 1999. All of the major transformation initiatives  called  for  in  the Report on the Bottom-Up Review were well under  way  before  the  year  began.  Army  leaders  could  therefore  focus their attentions on program execution rather than the development of new

concepts as the year progressed. In an effort to ensure that the current Force XXI process and the eventual transition to the Army After Next (AAN) would continue in the absence of further guidance from the Bottom-Up Review, Army  leaders  spent  part  of  the  year  articulating  a  new  Army Vision statement. That statement, scheduled for publication in early FY 2000, identified the Army' s core values and goals in the ongoing pursuit of Force XXI and AAN reforms.

Advanced  warfighting  experiments  conducted  throughout  the  year validated the tools and concepts for a fully digitized division to be equipped during FY 2000 as a step toward the eventual digitization of the entire Army and the fielding of Force XXI. On 1 September 1999, the Army received  the  first  M1A2  system  enhancement  program  Abrams  tanks. Those  vehicles  integrated  the  electronic  capabilities  of  the  new  digital force  with  a  proven  weapons  platform. Their  enhanced  command-andcontrol capabilities, combined with those of the Bradley fighting vehicles that  began  carrying  the  same  equipment  in  FY  1997,  will  significantly improve the coordination and lethality of digitized units.

The Army pursued other advanced systems in support of Force XXI and AAN goals while continuing to improve the short-term capabilities of the existing force. During FY 1999, two of the most prominent new systems passed significant milestones in their development. The second prototype  of  the  RAH-66  Comanche  armed  reconnaissance  helicopter began flight tests, as engineers started evaluating a redesigned tail section on the first prototype.  The first vehicle of the new Crusader artillery system, a  test  version  of  the  armored  transport  intended  to  resupply  a  separate self-propelled  howitzer,  entered  trials  in  July.  Comanche  and  Crusader ultimately  will  provide  reconnaissance  and  fire  support  for  Force  XXI. Research, development, testing, and evaluation efforts on these and other projects consumed $5 billion of the Army' s budget in FY 1999.

Procuring  and  retaining  sufficient  high-quality  personnel  is  at  least as  important  to  the  Army' s  mission  capability  as  is  obtaining  quality equipment. The booming civilian economy and high demand for skilled labor tempted both potential recruits and career soldiers away from the Army in FY 1999. Meeting the need for highly skilled and, in the civilian sector,  highly  paid  physicians  and  lawyers  proved  to  be  a  particular challenge.  Lawyers  of  the  Judge Advocate  General  Corps  continued  to leave the Army in response to the combination of their high levels of debt from student loans and substantially better civilian salaries. The Army also lost more than 34 percent of the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) physicians deployed in Operations Joint enDeavor and Joint guarD because of the impact of lengthy mobilizations on their civilian practices.

The Chaplain Corps faced a similar continuing shortage, particularly in the number of Roman Catholic priests volunteering to meet the needs of

the Army's growing number of Catholic personnel. During FY 1999, the general shortage of priests throughout the United States remained a topic of public interest. In August 1999, the Army responded to the question of faith-group underrepresentation in the Army chaplaincy by establishing the Directorate of Ministry Initiatives (DMI), scheduled to begin service in November 1999. The DMI was created to address the demand for more chaplains  through  aggressive  recruiting  and  retention  efforts,  initially focusing on the shortage of Army priests.

Despite problems in meeting the Army' s needs for such specific and highly sought professionals and for more general new accessions, overall FY99 end strength very closely corresponded with authorized levels. The active  Army attained 99.9 percent of its authorized 480,000-person strength. Army Reserve recruiters and retention efforts provided 99.4 percent of the authorized force of 208,003, and the Army National Guard exceeded its 357,223 target to report 100.1 percent of authorized strength by the end of the fiscal year.  Authorized levels still remained below validated requirements for  full-time  support  personnel  in  the  Guard  and  Reserve,  however-a persistent problem for reserve-component depot maintenance and general force readiness. The lack of sufficient personnel in  Army depots is a primary reason for the persistent maintenance backlogs at those facilities.

Army  personnel  continued  to  reflect  the  diversity  of  the  general population  in  FY  1999.  Within  the  active  Army,  20  percent  of  new personnel were female, surpassing the annual recruiting goal by 2 percent, while  women  composed  14.7  percent  of  the  active  Army  as  a  whole. African-Americans of both genders made up 26.5 percent of the active Army in FY 1999, Hispanics 7.6 percent, and Caucasians 59.2 percent. The reserve components reflected similar diversity. For comparison, the civilian population of 17-19-year-olds in 1999 was 14.2 percent AfricanAmerican, 14.9 percent Hispanic, and 66 percent Caucasian.

If  the  Army  had  reached  its  authorized  FY99  personnel  strength through the planned level of recruitment, rather than through the increased retention  efforts  it  used  to  overcome  continued  recruiting  shortfalls,  it would have faced a serious dilemma. In February the Training and Doctrine Command reported that its authorized funds were insufficient to provide training for the expected number of first-term recruits. Available resources would have produced a shortage of sixty-nine hundred active Army and ninety-three hundred reserve component training spaces for new enlisted personnel and five hundred spaces for newly commissioned officers. New accessions fell short of the FY99 target by 16,500, inadvertently avoiding the embarrassment of recruiting substantially more new personnel than the Army could train.

On a typical day in FY 1999, approximately 140,000 soldiers served in  seventy  foreign  nations,  thirty-one  thousand  of  them  on  operational

deployments. The Army contributed 60 percent of all U.S. forces engaged overseas during the year. Operation Joint guarD (Bosnia), Task Force able sentrY (Macedonia), and Operation southern watCh (Southern Iraqi nofly zone) all represented significant efforts that required amendments to the president' s proposed FY99 budget. Meeting those demands placed a heavy burden on the ten active and eight reserve divisions. Of the 1,462 active Army and reserve component units reporting deployment tempos in FY 1999, 8 percent exceeded the goal of 120 days or less away from their permanent stations, with 4 percent deployed for more than 180 days.

The  burdens  of  that  high  operating  tempo  fell  particularly  hard  on personnel  in  certain  high-demand  categories,  such  as  psychological operations specialists,  counterintelligence  agents,  interrogators,  infantry fighting  vehicle  crewmen,  and  cavalry  scouts.  Support  by  the  reserve component reduced the overall deployment tempo, but the growing reliance on Army Reserve and National Guard formations for overseas operations remained a discouragement to reenlistment or initial entry into the reserve components. Training, maintenance, and force readiness suffered from the ongoing rapid pace of operations.

National  Guard  personnel  continued  to  execute  their  civil  support and  disaster  relief  missions  during  FY  1999.  Hurricanes  Georges  and Mitch brought widespread damage to the Caribbean basin before striking along the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to mobilization by the various state governors to provide immediate domestic support, Army National Guard (ARNG)  personnel  provided  the  bulk  of  the  manpower  for  Operation new horiZons. That mission provided disaster relief and reconstruction support throughout the affected region, particularly in Honduras. Under the direction of U.S. Southern Command, the operation launched a new task force every thirty to sixty days, beginning in January 1999. By the time of the operation' s 4 August conclusion, 20,800 ARNG and USAR personnel had participated in new horiZons, accompanied by elements of the active Army and the other services.

Upon its selection by the U.S.  Army Reserve Command, Fort Dix became the  site  of  another  large-scale  humanitarian  relief  effort  by  the  reserve component. In response to the refugee crisis overwhelming the Republic of Macedonia during the spring of 1999, Operation proviDe reFuge established a sanctuary for 4,025 of the 13,989 refugees from ongoing unrest in Kosovo who temporarily relocated to the United States. Fort Dix, an Army Reserve installation, underwent a substantial expansion of facilities and personnel before  it  could  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  refugees.  For  example,  the existing company-size dining facility at Fort Dix grew to well over twenty times its original size. Thanks to the efforts of mobilized reservists, Fort Dix soon boasted four battalion-size and three company-size dining facilities to accommodate the Kosovars.

Feeding  more  than  four thousand  additional people at a post equipped  for  emergency  expansion  was  not  a  great  challenge  for  the personnel responsible for meeting the Army' s daily supply requirements. Administrative control of logistic matters was transferred from the assistant secretary of the Army for installations, logistics, and environment to the assistant secretary for research, development, and acquisition (subsequently renamed the assistant secretary for acquisition, logistics, and technology). Consolidating  acquisition  and  logistics  policy  management  within  the secretariat helped improve the efficiency of both Army functions. With his authorization of the reorganization, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera emphasized  the  continuing  need  for  improved  business  efficiency  and streamlined, modernized organizations consistent with the findings of the DOD's 1997 Defense Reform Initiative Report .

Total  asset  visibility-the  ability  of  logistics  personnel  to  track  the status and location of items in process, transit, storage, or use on a realtime  basis-offers  tremendous  potential  benefits  to  logistical  efficiency and force sustainment. During FY 1999, Operations Desert thunDer and Desert  Fox,  together  with  the  Foal  eagle  joint  exercise,  successfully employed the automated identification and tracking technologies of the Total Asset Visibility program. Much of that technology is commercially available off-the-shelf and that reduced the costs and risks associated with an overhaul of logistics management.

Capitalizing  on  such  technologies,  logisticians  experimented  with a  new  procedure  to  support  rapid  deployments.  During  FY  1999,  the Deployment Stock Package, an automated process improving the supply readiness of deploying units, successfully completed testing during unit rotations at the National Training Center. Its adoption by units in several posts within the continental United States and by others serving in Kuwait supported the development of Total Asset Visibility during FY 1999 even as it improved the responsiveness and sustainability of those units.

Cooperative agreements and sound relationships  with  allies  and  potential coalition partners play a key role in  Army strategy. Many of the deployments and exercises the Army undertook during the year were intended to maintain those relationships and  support coalition commitments.  The  deputy under secretary of the Army for international affairs (DUSA-IA) updated regulations pertaining to logistical support and other administrative aspects of the Army' s security assistance policies during the year. In particular, the Office of the DUSA-IA clarified definitions of weapons systems approved for export and made efforts to rationalize the Army' s system for formulating foreign transfer policy during the year.  Those accomplishments assisted both ongoing programs and the DUSA-IA's participation in the Arms Transfer Policy Review Group established by the deputy secretary of defense in FY 1999 expressly to construct unified policies.

Allegations  that  one  of  the  Army' s  premier  venues  for  delivering security  assistance  training  promoted  human  rights  violations  persisted throughout the year. The School of the Americas has trained officers of the United States' Latin American allies since 1946. Some of its graduates have been involved in alleged human rights violations, leading to public outcry and an efforts by members of the House of Representatives to close the school by prohibiting it from using security assistance funds under the proposed FY00 Foreign Appropriations Act. Only a conference resolution, requiring  the  secretary  of  defense  to  certify  that  the  curriculum  of  the school, particularly in regard to human rights, meets the high standards used in training U.S. personnel, prevented the school' s closure at the end of FY 1999.

If the School of the Americas proved able to withstand close scrutiny, the same cannot be said of the careers of two officers. The court-martial of retired Maj. Gen. David R. E. Hale, and his subsequent reduction in rank to brigadier general, drew considerable public attention to the Army' s sexual harassment policies. Following his guilty plea and sentencing in March, the Army changed its retirement policies to prevent officers under investigation  from  leaving  active  service  without  careful  review.  Under that policy the September retirement request of Maj. Gen. John J. Maher III,  facing  nonjudicial  punishment,  was  not  automatically  honored. The general was fined and reprimanded later that month, and the outcome of a grade determination review board convened by order of Secretary Caldera will establish his retirement status in early FY 2000.

The  Office  of  the  Judge  Advocate  General  (JAG)  handled  the proceedings against the two officers as part of a caseload that returned to a relatively normal balance after the increase in nonjudicial punishment proceedings  and  decrease  in  courts-martial  recorded  for  1997.  During the  1998  calendar  year,  family  law  passed  estate  law  as  the  primary legal service Army personnel sought from the JAG Corps. The number of  requests  for  notary  services,  powers  of  attorney,  will  preparations, and referrals to civilian attorneys climbed significantly during the JAG reporting  year  that  ended  during  FY  1999,  despite  the  slight  decline in  total Army  strength. That  growing  workload  did  not  help  the  JAG' s recruiting and retention problems.

Quality  of  life  remains  one  of  the  greatest  inducements  to  Army service and most powerful guarantees of strong morale. Thus the Army took significant steps to implement the new family housing privatizing program  by  turning  over  the  housing  at  Fort  Carson,  Colorado,  to  a private-sector  firm  contracted  to  renovate  1,823  family  housing  units and construct 840 new homes. Development continued on pilot projects to  place  13,711  family  housing  units  on  three  posts  under  private management, improving the quality and cost efficiency of that important

resource  through  the  authority  provided  in  the  1996  Military  Housing Privatization Act. The needs of single soldiers were addressed through the Whole Barracks Renewal Program, which authorized the construction or modernization of 11,700 spaces to the one-plus-one standard during the fiscal year. Meeting that standard, which requires a private sleeping and living area for every soldier, was the Army' s highest priority in facilities development for FY 1999.

Educational opportunities are a prominent benefit of Army service. During FY 1999, the Army joined the other services to establish a uniform tuition assistance policy throughout the DOD. That policy enables activeduty military personnel to be reimbursed for 75 percent of tuition costs, up to an annual maximum of $187.50 per semester hour or $3,500 per year, to attend accredited educational programs. Under the new plan, a soldier may receive tuition assistance to repeat a failed course if he or she first reimburses the government for any assistance received in support of the failed course.

The  quality  of  life  offered  by Army  service  also  benefits  from  the Army's continuing efforts to guarantee equal opportunity and equitable treatment for all. In support of that goal, in October 1998 the Army began distributing a handbook titled Human Dignity: The Prevention of Sexual Harassment .  High-profile  disciplinary  proceedings  in  FY  1998  and  FY  1999 arising from allegations of sexual harassment brought renewed attention to the issue and might have contributed to an increase in the number of equal employment opportunity complaints. During FY 1999, the Office of the Judge  Advocate General pursued 250 more informal complaints of unlawful discrimination from Army civilians than it did in the previous fiscal year. The office directed a new Army-wide program for the mediation of such disputes, quadrupling the number of complaints addressed by alternative procedures in FY 1998. That effort might have contributed to the Army' s receiving  one  hundred  fewer  formal  discrimination  complaints  from  its civilian workforce in FY 1999.

Avoiding  undue  disruption  to  the  lives  of  servicemembers  and families affected by the U.S. withdrawal from Panama provided another challenge  for Army  leaders.  U.S. Army  South  faced  the  twin  problems of  establishing  a  new  headquarters  at  Fort  Buchanan,  Puerto  Rico,  and expediting the relocation of Army personnel and families from Panama to either that location or posts in the continental United States. The personnel challenge  was  met  through  the  expedient  of  transitional  housing.  The transfer of personal household goods from Panama to continental posts required  approximately  sixty  days.  U.S.  Army  South  designated  four hundred housing units for the use of Army families in their final sixty days in Panama, providing the required transit window. All Army dependents were ordered out of Panama by August 1999. At the end of the fiscal year,

only  a  few  hundred Army  personnel  and  contractors  remained  there  to await the final transfer of the Panama Canal and remaining United States property in the former Canal Zone on 31 December.

In FY 1999, even without major changes in policy or the launch of substantial  new  programs,  there  was  no  shortage  of  challenges  for  the men and women of the U.S. Army. They successfully weathered storm and scandal at home while they provided the majority of the American military presence abroad. Despite resource constraints, they maintained force readiness and protected the peace in Bosnia, Kosovo, and other faraway areas of the world. The reform process launched by the Report on the Bottom-Up Review continued through the last year of that document' s formal guidance, moving the Army toward Force XXI and its successor, AAN.  As  Army  information  specialists  planned  and  adapted  for  the potential  threat  posed  by  New Y ear' s  Day  2000,  the  Army  as  a  whole continued to prepare for the approaching twenty-first century.
