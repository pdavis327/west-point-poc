## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1996

## Introduction

In fiscal year (FY) 1996, the Army conducted various changes that had been initiated in previous years. The end of  the Cold War had spelled  the end of an Army of approximately three-quarters of  a  million soldiers, and the nation's  ground force in 1996 was still evolving into a smaller military. The transition from a forward-deployed Army to a power-projection force neared completion as  hundreds of installations  were closed overseas.  Power-pro› jection platforms (installations in the United States designated  for immedi› ate mobilization and deployment of  Army units, troops, and equipment to meet worldwide contingencies) improved their infrastructure and received new Army elements. The decline in available funds persisted, however, and the Army found itself  involved in a massive military operation at the end of 1995 that lasted unabated throughout the rest of the fiscal  year. Even with diminishing funds,  the Army trained its  personnel, deployed units world› wide in  response  to crises, procured  new equipment, and modernized old systems. The area in which the Army particularly struggled was maintain› ing or improving quality of life for its soldiers and their families.

The resource decline that persisted through FY 96 reduced the Army's ability  to  procure  and  modernize.  The  Army  budget  was  constrained severely  with  the  advent  of Operation  JorNT  ENDEAvOR  in  Bosnia,  the largest  sustained  military  operation  since  Operation  DESERT  STORM. Contingency or crisis response operations were not traditionally permitted to be included in the Army's budget; hence, the Army had to pay for this massive relocation of  troops, supplies, and equipment out of  its Operation and Maintenance, Army (OMA), account. In FY 96, the Total Army OMA account was budgeted at  $23.7 billion. Congress reprogrammed $1.65 bil› lion  to  support Operation JOINT  ENDEAvOR  and other contingencies,  but the  Army  still  absorbed  an  expenditure  of $611  million,  reducing  the funds available for training and readiness programs. Although the Army's Total  Obligation  Authority  (TOA)  increased  slightly  from  FY  95,  the decline  that  had  begun  in  FY 86  did  not cease, with the  $64.9  billion authorized for FY 96 being reduced to $60.1  billion in FY 97. Moreover, the Army's share of the Department of Defense (DOD) budget averaged 26.3  percent between FY 89 and FY 96 but was scheduled to decline to 23.6 percent between FY 97 and FY 01.

During FY 96, the Army successfully decreased its size in an ongoing effort to  meet the goals for personnel strength that the  1993 Bottom-Up Review  (BUR)  required.  The active  Army,  due  to  higher attrition  than expected, ended the year with 4,000 fewer troops than planned. The Army National Guard  (ARNG)  was  steadily  achieving  its  designated  end strength, needing only to reduce an additional3,000 soldiers by the end of FY 97. The U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) decreased its force by 15,100 sol› diers,  and  the Army's civilian workforce eliminated  14,100 personnel  in FY 96.  Bottom-Up Review goals for the Reserve and for Army civilians were scheduled to be reached in FY 98 and FY 01, respectively. At the end of  FY 96, with 49 1,000 active Army soldiers, 370,000 Guard soldiers, and 226,200 reservists, the Total Army's strength of 1,087,200 troops was the smallest it bad been since the end of  World War II.  In  addition, the U.S. Army had dropped from  being the fourth largest active-duty army in the world  in  FY  89  to  the  seventh  largest in  FY  96,  behind  China,  North Korea, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Thrkey.

In  the aftermath of  the Cold War, the Army in  FY 96 moved forward in  redesigning its  operational  forces  to  meet  the  requirements of Force XXIthe vision of  an Army that exploits information technology, partic› ularly for weapons systems, and is capability based rather than focused on identifiable  threats  or stuck  in  the  industrial  age.  A  significant change resulting from Force XXI wilJ  be a  new  divisional  structure.  In January 1996, the Army approved an experimental heavy division with 15,800 sol› diers, which is  15  percent smaller than  the current division size. The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), with three maneuver brigades and an air cavalry  brigade,  was  designated  the  experimental  force  (EXFOR)  for Force  XXI. In addition  to testing  new concepts and technologies during FY 96, the EXFOR is scheduled for an Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE)  in  March 1997  at  the  National  Training  Center  (NTC) in California. The AWE  will  test the EXFOR's ability  to  fight;  implement doctrinal, training, and combat development changes; and field  124 new systems designed to improve the Army's  capability to win the information war, conduct precision strikes, dominate the maneuver battle, and project, sustain, and protect the force.  Force XXI, in its third year of  planning and experimentation,  will  produce Army  XXI, a  twenty-first century Army organized, equipped, and staffed to  maximize the potential of the  infor› mation  age.  Lessons  learned  from  Army  XXI  will  produce  the  "Army After Next," a more agile, lethal, and versatile force for the future.

The process of creating a power-projection force  based primarily in the  United  States  and  of transferring  additional  responsibility  to  the reserve  components  required  significant  changes  in  the  Army's  force structure. In FY 96, the final reduction in the number of  active Army divi› sions occurred as their number declined from 12 to 10. Combined with the

Guard's force of 8 divisions,  the Total Army reached its goal  of 18 divi› sions and  is capable of dispatching a contingency force  of up  to  7 divi› sions  anywhere  in  the  world.  Twelve  of fifteen  enhanced  readiness brigades  completed  rigorous  training  in  FY 96,  cementing  the  Guard's new role as the principal reserve ground combat  maneuver  force. Formation  of enhanced readiness  brigades,  capable  of deploying ninety days  after  mobilization,  had  been  recommended  by  the  1993  BUR  to replace  the  Guard's roundout  brigades.  The  total  number  of separate brigades in the Guard declined from 24 to 22 in FY 96 and was scheduled to drop to  18  in FY 97.

Readiness remained one of  the Army's  key priorities during FY 96.1ts importance  was  reiterated  in  DOD's announcement  of a  five-year  plan emphasizing readiness, quality oflife, and modernization as the three high› est priorities. The Anny's ability to deploy  thousands of troops to Bosnia for  Operation  JOINT ENDEAVOR  and  to  sustain them  for  months signified that Army soldiers and equipment, in active and reserve components, were trained  and  ready.  The Army's ground force  readiness enhancement pro› gram, designed to provide collective training for reserve components, was fully  established,  with  several  hundred  trainers  assigned  to  each  of six regional  training brigades.  Thousands  of soldiers  trained  as  part of  their units  in  realistic exercises evoking the combat environment at one of the major training centers in the United States or overseas. In addition, thou› sands of  other soldiers participated in nation-building exercises, joint exer› cises, and combined exercises, further increasing their individual and unit skills. To improve readiness, the Army invested $33 million in constructing new  training  facilities.  Additionally,  the  Army  instituted  a  Total  Army School System (TASS) to integrate active and reserve component schools, while the Guard developed a vast network of  distance learning classrooms to distribute  information  to its soldiers. A  total of  125,000  soldiers remained forward deployed in Europe, the Pacific, and Panama.

Although restructuring and reorganization were  important during FY 96,  the  activity  that  had  the  greatest effect on  the  Army  was  Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR. Supporting one of  the largest peacetime operations since World War II, U.S. forces began deploying to Bosnia in December 1995 to monitor  and  enforce  the  Dayton  Peace  Accords  as  part  of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)  first  operational commitment of forces.  Eleven nations, including former Warsaw Pact countries, supplied brigades  to  reinforce Task  Force  Eagle,  composed  primarily  of the  1st Armored  Division.  Guard  and  Reserve  soldiers  were  mobilized  and deployed at the outset, validating the Total Army concept. The success of Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR and other missions in tJ1e Balkan region result› ed in  free elections in Bosnia in September 1996. In addition to Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, Total Army soldiers deployed  to more than sixty coun-

tries around the world in military operations other than war during FY 96. Soldiers  found  themselves  increasingly  involved  in  humanitarian  and peacekeeping operations;  as  a  result,  they  spent  lengthier periods  away from their home stations.

Despite the declining budget for procurement or modernization, Army organizations managed to develop numerous new weapons systems and upgrade older ones. Major weapons systems under development included the  Crusader  field artillery  system,  the  Theater  High-Altitude  Area Defense (THAAD) system,  the Javelin antitank missile system, and  the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter. At the same time, the Army reconfigured the  M1A1  Abrams  tank,  upgraded  the  M2A2/M3A2  Bradley  Fighting Vehicle,  and improved  the  capabilities  of the  Army  Tactical  Missile System (ATACMS). With respect to the aviation fleet, the Army modern› ized  the  AH-64  Apache  helicopter,  modified  the  UH-60  Black  Hawk helicopter, and extended the service life of  the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. In addition, the Multiple Launch  Rocket System (MLRS) acquired new capabilities, and  new  tactical vehicles  were  fielded  to  units. While attempting to wring as much as possible out of limited resources, Army procurement and modernization programs emphasized systems that would facilitate  attaining  and  maintaining  battlefield  superiority  against  any adversary. The FY 96 Army budget for research, development, and acqui› sition (RDA) was $12.2 billion, a decrease of39 percent since FY 89 and representing only 13 percent of  the DOD budget for RDA.

Throughout FY 96, installation realignments and closures under the Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  process  were  executed.  The Army's final installation recommended for closure under BRAC 88 was shut down;  at the same time, the Army began closing installations faster than  the  BRAC  processes  of subsequent  years  required.  Fort  Devens, Massachusetts, the last installation identified for closure under BRAC 91, closed  a  year  early,  while Vint  Hill  Farms  Station,  Virginia,  was  set to close two years early in FY 97 as part of BRAC 93. Under BRAC 95, the Army closed Fort Holabird, Maryland, in the first year of implementing that round of  closures.  Massive troop moves occurred with these closings and  realignments. New  facilities were  constructed  at  Fort  Carson, Colorado, to house the 1Oth Special Forces Group from Fort Devens, and the Military Police and Chemical  Schools moved from  Fort McClellan, Alabama, to Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri. As a result of these closings and realignments, the Army improved its power-projection platform capa› bilities and its ability to respond to worldwide threats. Although the imme› diate effect of  such changes was a rise in expenditures, the Army will ulti› mately save resources by consolidating its combat forces and eliminating expensive  and  unnecessary  infrastructure. In addition,  the  Army  made considerable progress toward aligning its active and reserve components,

particularly  with respect  to  training  and schools,  to  facilitate  the  mobi› lization  and deployment of reserve  units  that have  become  increasingly significant in Army operations.

Great strides in  the Army's environmental stewardship program were accomplished during FY 96 on  a budget of $789 million, less than allo› cated in  previous years.  Under a new DOD program assigning responsi› bility  for environmental  cleanup  to  the services,  the Army  restored  the f irst DOD site to  acceptable standards.  During the year,  the Army com› pleted  the  identification  and  screening  of all  potential  sites  needing cleanup;  I  percent  has  been  restored.  The Army  improved  its  resource management of  site clean-up funds, allocating two-thirds of  the budget to cleanup, surpassing the DOD goal. For the third year in a row, fewer fines and penalties for noncompliance or violations resulted from the growth of the Army's  environmental program. In addition to reducing the amount of its hazardous waste more quickly than scheduled, the Army also decreased the cost considerably of  disposing of such waste.  When  DOD presented five  of fifteen  environmental  awards  to  the  Army,  the  success  of the Army's environmental program was validated.

New and existing legislation compelled the Army  to  work  harder at adopting commercial business practices in  an effort to  reduce  costs and conserve  resources.  Authorizing  simplified  acquisition  procedures  for commercial items costing between $100,000 and $5 million, the Clinger› Cohen  Act  of  1996  reduced  acquisition  time.  The  Chief Information Officers  Act of  1996  required that each  federal agency's  Chief Information  Officer  (CIO)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (CFO)  work together to develop an accounting, financial, and asset management sys› tem. Providing  uniform  accounting  standards,  the  Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 required full  financial disclosure from  all federal agencies.  To  satisfy  the  guidelines  of  the  National Performance Review (NPR) of 1995, which emphasized results, customer satisfaction, decentralization, and mission  focus,  the Army implemented new  initiatives.  These  included  streamlining  procedures,  decentralizing acquisition  decision  making,  and  focusing  on  purchasing  commercial items rather than developing military-specific products.

In February 1996, the Clinton administration issued the new National Security Strategy of  Engagement and Enlargement, which maintained the strategy of furthering the growth of democracy around  the  world  while deterring and limiting threats. As the world's premier economic and mili› tary power, the United States exercised its global leadership toward devel› oping a more peaceful, democratic, and prosperous world,  believing that such actions would further U.S.  objectives for a safer and more prosper› ous  America.  The  central  components  of  the  national  strategy  were enhancing U.S. security through a strong defense and using diplomacy to

promote cooperative security; opening foreign markets and spurring eco› nomic growth; and promoting democracy abroad.

The  military  is  a  key  instrument  in  ensuring that national  security objectives are met. The national strategy requires a military capability suf› ficient to win two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts while also providing a credible overseas presence. In conjunction with other nation› al  resources, the military was  used  to  deter aggression; enforce treaties; promote stabili.ty; strengthen emerging democratic states; fight terrorism; support counterdrug efforts; and reduce the danger of nuclear, chemical, biological, and conventional conflict. The military empowered the United States with the ability to act unilaterally,  in  alliance with another nation, or multilaterally to protect national interests abroad.

The Army worked to redesign itself in FY 96 to meet the challenges of the  new  international  environment in which  numerous  threats  had replaced the monolithic Soviet threat of  the Cold War era. With declining resources and fewer personnel, the Army concentrated its efforts on effec› tively and efficiently using technology, information, equipment, and peo› ple. The Army strove to maintain the capabilities necessary to protect U.S. interests and to achieve land force dominance over potential adversaries. With a smaller force,  the Army emphasized modernization efforts more than ever before to ensure technological domination. During FY 96, with its deployment to Bosnia in Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, the Army proved that it was well trained, well equipped, and ready to fight.

## Organization and Management

## Organizational Changes

## Organizations

In  FY  96, the Army's restructuring  program to conserve  dwindling resources and use its decreasing workforce more effectively achieved con› siderable progress. For over twenty years, separate agencies had provided developmental and operational evaluations for the Army. The Operational Test and  Evaluation Agency had conducted operational tests and evalua› tions  of major  and  selected  norunajor  programs.  The  Army  Materiel Systems Analysis Activity had performed developmental  evaluations  of major and  selected nonmajor systems for the Army Materiel Command (AMC), while the Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM) was respon› sible for developmental evaluations of  the majority of  nonmajor systems. Army programs often faced two sets of  tests and evaluationsfirst, devel› opmental; second, operational. Some Army systems encountered two sets of testers and two sets of  evaluators before they were fielded.

As the  budget for  research,  development,  and acquisition,  including test and evaluation (T  &amp;E), declined in the 1990s, an emphasis began to be placed on  streamlined acquisition and organizational teamwork. Numerous studies and initiatives on T&amp;E in  1995 resulted in the concept of integrated test and evaluation (IT&amp;E), in which operational issues were addressed  during  system  development  and  T&amp;E.  Thjs  consolidation enabled the program manager to  involve the evaluator in experiments for rapid  acquisition  initiatives,  such  as  warfigbting  experiments  or  battle labs, which might have led to  formal acquisition programs. An increased emphasis on modeling and simulation was expected to reduce or enhance testing.

On 12 June 1996, the Vice Chief of  Staff of  the Army, General Ronald H.  Griffith,  directed that  the  Operational Test and  Evaluation Command (OPTEC) be given the responsibility and resources for developmental eval› uation of  major programs, as well as the assessment of  nonmajor programs and  survivability  analysis. Effective 1  October  1996,  OPTEC  would

receive a transfer of these functions from  the Army Research Laboratory and AMC's Survivability and Analysis Directorate. As OPTEC became the single evaluator for all Army systems, evaluation reports were reduced to one. Additionally, developmental  evaluations  were  funded  institutionally, ending the traditional  practice of partial  funding  by  program  managers, which, in turn, permitted OPTEC to exhibit independence.

In  its  effort  to  downsize  53  percent from  FY  89  to  FY  01,  AMC reengineered  and  restructured  its  organization  extensively.  The  primary example  was  the  disestablishment  of the  Aviation  and  Troop  Support Command  (ATCOM).  Located  in  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  ATCOM  was formed in October 1992 in response to a BRAC 91 decision that combined aviation and troop support functions. A BRAC 95 decision, however, dis› established the command with elements moving to  the Tank-Automotive and  Armaments  Command  (TACOM),  Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), Soldier Systems Command, and Missile Command (MICOM). AMC believed the resulting organization would  permit  it  to achieve operational efficiencies.

Soldier Systems Command, located in Natick, Massachusetts, was a new organization formed with no additional resources and in a short peri› od of time.  The  command's mission  was to  view  individual  soldiers  as "systems" to  optimize their capabilities and  to  improve their quality of lif e.  Teamwork between Soldier Systems Command and ATCOM, along with innovative initiatives, resulted in the design and fielding of  new sys› tems for soldiers stationed in  Bosnia. The command was recognized as a leader in  eliminating procurement specifications;  its Land Warrior  pro› gram is a key building block in Force XXI, the Army's  force for the twen› ty-first century.

Missile  Command  was  also  reshaping to  achieve  higher efficiency and effectiveness. New readiness initiatives and value engineering awards resulted in $129 million in savings, as well as the highest missile systems readiness  rates  in  ten  years.  The  command's Army  Primary  Standards Laboratory was  the  first  DOD  facility  to be  accredited  by  the National Institute of  Standards and Technology.

After  three  years  of planning  and  preparation,  the  Army  National Guard activated the Operational Support Airlift Command (OSACOM) on 2 October 1995. Responsibility for all day-to-day airlift support missions for the Total Army within the continental United States (CONUS) resided with OSACOM from that point forward. The mission, transferred from the active Army, consolidated 49 Guard aircraft from state flight detachments throughout CONUS and 77 active Army airplanes from 15 regional flight centers. Full-time active Army and Guard soldiers, as well as Department of the Army (DA) civilians,  belonged to  the command.  OSACOM's air transport missions decreased commercial air costs by $18.4 million.

PERSCOM (U.S. Total Army Personnel Command) gained new mis› sions  in  three  functional areas:  Army  Retirement Services Office (from Community and Family Support Center [CFSC]); Professional Development  (from  Health  Services  Command);  and  Army  Medical Department {AMEDD)  {Acquisition)  (from  the  Office  of the  Surgeon General). With these new missions, PERSCOM gained 13 personnel. The number of  personnel authorized to PERSCOM, however, declined signif› icantly  during  FY  96  as  335  authorizations  for civilian  personnel  man› agement and civilian personnel office regionalization were transferred to the  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  (Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs) (ASA  [M&amp;RA]).  Additional  reductions,  resulting  from  DA  initiatives, changes in funding, early  retirement and separation, and civilian person› nel office regionalization, decreased PERSCOM authorizations by a fur› ther 337 personnel.

PERSCOM experienced other significant changes in FY 96 with the downsizing  and  reorganization  of the  Force  Integration  and  Analysis Division within the Office of  the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Plans (ODCS› PLANS). The Special  Management Division was removed from ODCS› PLANS  and  placed  under  OPMD  (Officer  Personnel  Management Directorate).  In August  1996,  the  Personnel Management Authorization Document  (PMAD)  function  was  removed  from  the  Classification Structure Integration  Division  (CSID),  ODCSPLANS,  and given  to  the Office  of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Personnel  (ODCSPER).  The PMAD was the Army's single source for active Army authorizations and the Army's most current and  accurate personnel authorization document. Effective  September 1996,  ODCSPLANS  eliminated  the  Personnel Integration  Division,  incorporating  its  personnel  system  function  and workforce into the CSID. CSID then established the Personnel Proponent Branch (PPB), whose mission  was to  optimize the eight  lifecycle  man› agement functions  for  personnel  between  the  branch proponents,  major Army commands {MACOMs), and the Army Staff.  ODCSPLANS also eliminated its Force Structure Branch, reassigning its perso1mel within the MiJitary District of  Washington (MOW).

A major effort to  reengineer the Army's medical assets for the next century  resulted  in  the  activation of the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Command (MEDCOM) in 1994, referred to by General Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief  of Staff of the Army (CSA), as the "first Force XXI major command." The Army Surgeon  General, Lt.  Gen.  Alcide M.  LaNoue,  immediately  con› ducted a top-to-bottom functional analysis of  assets with the intent of  cre› ating  a streamlined,  "flattened"  organization  to  ensure  that  medical requirements were being anticipated and properly met. As a result, seven regional  medical  commands  (RMC)  were  created  to  integrate  reserve component forces,  containing  70  percent of the  Army's medical  assets,

into a seamless, combat-ready force by improving liaison with all units in their geographical areas.

The Army has long recognized that soldiers and  their families  must remain healthy, whether before, during, or after deployments. In addition, reemphasizing wellness could reduce health care costs. The new Center of Health and Preventive Medicine, established in FY 96, concentrated pro› motion  and  prevention  assets  in  one unified organization.  Soldiers  and families would be taught to develop and maintain healthy lifestyles, there› by  eliminating  potentially  devastating  illnesses and their corresponding emotional and financial burdens.

An entirely new organization was established in the Army Secretariat, combining  functional responsibilities  that  were previously  spread throughout the Secretariat and the Army Staff. The Secretary of  the Army activated the Office  of  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Army (International  Affairs)  (ODUSA-IA)  in  May  1996,  providing  a  single office  to  develop  policy  on  and  implementation  of Army  international activities in support of  U.S.  national security objectives. The organization supported  the  Secretary of the Army and  the CSA, and  represented  the Army on all international  policy matters with the Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD), defense agencies, and other services, as well as before Congress.  As  the  DOD  Executive Agent  on  numerous  issues  requiring interagency and multinational organization coordination, the Secretary of the Anny delegated this responsibility to the DUSA-IA. Through its inter› national  activities,  the organization supported Army regional component commanders' strategies and objectives. ODUSA-IA was directly respon› sible for the Army's relationships with international organizations, as well as with foreign govenunents, armies, and defense departments.

The  organization's  functional  responsibilities  were  divided  among political-military interaction, security assistance, materiel-technical coop› eration, and foreign attache liaison. PoJitical-military interaction included activities to improve mutual understanding, enhance military capabilities, and  share  experiences  with  friendly  and allied  nations  that  might  have been expected  to  participate  in  future  coalition operations. The Army's security assistance program helped provide friendly and allied nations the capability to defend themselves against legitimate threats. Equipment, ser› vices, and  training were transferred to foreign governments and interna› tional  organizations  through  foreign  military  sales,  direct  commercial sales, international military education  and  training,  foreign military financing, transfer of  excess defense articles, and provision of  equipment and services to support peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance opera› tions.  Materiel-technical cooperation activities were primarily conducted with  industrialized  nations  to  improve  multinational  force  compatibility and foster defense cooperation  in armaments by eliminating  duplication

and  sharing  weapons  systems  research  and  development.  ODUSA-IA's foreign  attache  liaison  function  supported  foreign  attaches,  interacted with the Washington Foreign Military Attache Corps, and showcased the Army to high-level visiting foreign military and civilian personnel.

Diminishing resources and the HQDA (Headquarters, Department of the Army) Redesign initiative, a comprehensive review of processes and functions by senior Army leadership that recommended consolidation and streamlining,  forced  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for Installation Management (OACSIM) to develop restructuring plans in FY 96 to  decrease and  reshape  the  organization.  Initiatives to reduce  OAC› SIM by 333 spaces between FY 96 and FY 03  were adopted, and imple› mentation began in FY 96. At the same time, OACSIM's major programs (BRAC,  Barracks Construction  and  Renovation, Army Communities of Excellence,  Environmental Restoration,  and  Community  and  Family Programs) survived, while new programs (such as Competitive Sourcing, Capital Venture Initiatives, and Leased Space Reductions) were initiated.

At the beginning ofFY 96, OACSIM's  authorized strength, including its  two  staff support agen€ies  (SSAs) and  three field  operating activities (FOAs) was 769 personnel. The two SSAs were the Army Environmental Office  and  the  BRAC  Office.  The  three  FOAs  were  the  Installation Support Management Activity,  the Army Environmental Center, and the Community and Family Support Center. In  FY 96,  the Community and Family Support Center, the largest activity with 331 personnel, gained 135 spaces  with  the  transfer  of the  Army  Marksmanship  Unit  from  Forces Command (FORSCOM) but began a reduction of  216 spaces, which was scheduled to end in FY 97. The two SSAs were scheduled for elimination between  FY 97 and FY 03,  with  their functions  to  be transferred else› where within OACSIM or its  FOAs.  In  addition, other offices would  be reduced or eliminated.

In summer 1995, Secretary of  the Army Togo D. West, Jr., decided that the  Army  needed a  more  effective  resource  allocation  process  than  the Select  Committee (SELCOM),  the  28-person  HQDA senior committee that reviewed, coordinated, and integrated the Army's  Planning, Programming,  Budgeting,  and  Execution  System  (PPBES)  actions.  In addition, the SELCOM reviewed Army policy, plans, programs, and bud› gets, and  referred  important issues to the  Secretary of  the Army and  the CSA.  Secretary  West  was  particularly  interested  in  creating  a  more streamlined decision-making body and involving the top Army leaders in the resource process.

On 20 July  1995, Secretary West disestablished SELCOM and estab› lished  the  Army  Resources  Board  (ARB)  as  the  Army's final  decision authority on policy, plans, programs,  and  budgets. The  Secretary of the Army, with the CSA as vice chair, chaired the nine-member ARB, which

paralleled the Defense Resources Board. In contrast, the Under Secretary of the Army and  the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army had cochaired the SELCOM. The mission of  the ARB Support Group, which met regularly, was to review all  issues and attempt to resolve problems before the ARB considered them. The ARB Support Group was designed to facilitate the process and enable senior leaders to  oversee jointly PPBES and support the ARB process.  If necessary, the twelve-member ARB Support Group could expand by four additional senior leaders to  form the ARB Support Group-Ad Hoc to discuss issues requiring broader input.

On  11  January  1996,  the  Under Secretary  of Defense  (Acquisition and Technology) designated the Army to establish a Joint Aerostat Project Management  Office  for  Cruise  Missile  Defense  (CMD).  Employing sophisticated  sensor  packages  in  tethered,  lighter-than-air  platforms, aerostats could provide over-the-horizon surveillance, tracking, and fire control for air defense systems such as the Patriot, the Medium Extended Air  Defense  System  (MEADS)/Corps  surface-to-air  missile,  and  the Navy SM2. On 22 January, OSD increased the Army's  TOA by $533 mil› lion  from  the FY 97-D  I  POM (Program Objective Memorandum), pro› viding  funds  for  the  program.  The  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army (Research,  Development,  and Acquisition)  (ASA  [RD&amp;A])  tasked  the Commanding  General,  U.S. Army  Space  and Strategic Defense Command  (SSDC),  on  6  February  to  set  up  the  organization  in Huntsville, Alabama.  SSDC maintained operational control of the orga› nization with joint staffing. From FY 96 to FY 02, technology develop› ment was expected to cost $655 million and produce two aerostat-bascd operational sensor units.

## Installations

In  the early  1960s, DOD closed major military installations without concern for the effect upon surrounding communities; in response, legis› lation in the mid-l970s required congressional involvement in the future. In 1983, a presidential commission recommended that a nonpartisan inde› pendent commission  be  established  to  approve  DOD  recommendations and, in  J  988, the Secretary of  Defense chartered a BRAC Commission. To alleviate concerns about whether the process was fair and objective,  the BRAC Act of 1990 established a uniform evaluation procedure for all mi  1itary  services.  The BRAC Act further required  the convening of BRAC Commissions, consisting of presidential  appointees,  in  1991,  1993, and 1995  to  review  DOD  recommendations  for  closures  and  realignments. Nearly all of the Army's recommendations for BRAC 95, the last down› sizing opportunity for the future, were approved. In  1996, the final list of installations to be closed or realigned under the BRAC Act of 1990 was approved.

With  expenditures  on  unnecessary  installations  decreasing  signifi› cantly,  resources  were freed  for  readiness  and  modernization  programs. The Army was planning to be positioned for Force XXI without the bur› den of  excess infrastructure. Additionally, valuable assets could revert to local communities when no longer needed by the Army. The majority of all  Army  installations  were  affected  by  the  BRAC  process,  whether as BRAC candidates or by receiving  functions  from  closing or realigning sites.  Since full  implementation of all four commissions was expected to result  in  recurring annual  savings of about $1  billion, the Army pursued efforts in FY 96 to accelerate all BRAC actions from previous rounds.

In 1995, the Army reached an  important milestone for the BRAC pro› gram,  closing  the  last  of the  installations  recommended  for  closure  by BRAC 88. Additionally, the Army began to work aggressively to initiate the twenty-nine closures and eleven realignments recommended by BRAC 95 and  to execute  requirements under BRAC 91  and 93.  During FY 96,  the Army  closed  Fort  Devens,  Massachusettsthe  last  of five  installations identified for closure by BRAC 91a year early. Fort Devens'  primary ten› ant,  the  1Oth  Special  Forces  Group,  relocated  to  Fort  Carson,  Colorado, upon completion of  newly constructed facilities. Closure of  Fort  Devens and the  realignment of the Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi,  Maryland, concluded the successful BRAC 91  program. The closure ofVint Hill Farms Station  in  Virginia,  the Army's only  base elimination in BRAC 93,  was scheduled to be completed by the end of  FY 97, two years early. FY 96 was the  first  of a  six-year  implementation period for  the BRAC 95  round. In September 1996, Fort Holabird, Maryland, as part ofBRAC 95, was closed. In  1996,  the Army  completed  the  St.  Louis-based ATCOM  closure and began construction at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, to house the Military Police and Chemical Schools from Fort McClellan, Alabama.

Installations  scheduled  for  realignment in  FY 97  were  Fort Meade, Maryland; Detroit  Arsenal, Michigan; Fort Dix, New Jersey; and Fort Lee, Virginia;  this  necessitated  preparatory  work in FY 96 as  part of BRAC 95's twenty-nine closures and eleven realignments. Smaller base or activ› ity closures, realignments, disestablishments, or  relocations that were con› tingent upon selling the property at fair market value, as prescribed by the commission, included Branch  U.S. Disciplinary  Barracks,  Lompoc, California; Rio Vista Army Reserve Center, California; and Big Coppett Key,  Florida,  all  closed  in  January  1996.  Scranton Ammunition  Plant, Pennsylvania, closed in March  1996, though its closure was not directed by a BRAC commission or mandated by public law. By the end ofFY 96, the Army had closed 674 facilities worldwide (81 in the United States, 572 in Europe,  17 in Korea and the Pacific, and 4 in Panama).

To  alleviate  the  economic  impact upon  local  communities,  a  1993 presidential initiative and its subsequent inclusion in the National Defense

Authorization Act of  FY 94 gave authority to the Secretary of  the Army to transfer real or personal  property at closing or realigning installations to promote economic redevelopment and job creation.  Under this  new dis› posal process, termed an economic development conveyance (EDC), the Army could  review  a local reuse authority (LRA)  business  plan for the property and establish a payment plan. In FY 96, EDCs were approved for Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana; Fort Devens, Massachusetts; and Tooele Army Depot, Utah.  In addition,  the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development submitted an EDC in July 1996 for the Defense Personnel Support Center Clothing Factory in Philadelphia.

Closed in  1995, Fort Benjamin Harrison was approved for an EDC to the Fort Harrison Reuse Authority at a reimbursed cost of  $6.1  million to be  paid over ten  years  in  four  installments. The state purchased  the golf course; a new state park would preserve 1  ,400 acres as a wildlife habitat; and  the main post would become the town center for Lawrence, Indiana. Redeveloping the installation was expected to provide 6,000 new jobs.

When  Fort Devens  was  closed,  the  Army  retained  a  portion  as  the Devens Reserve Forces Training Area.  Other portions were transferred to the Department of  Labor; the Federal Bureau ofPrisons for a regional med› ical  facility;  and  the  U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service for  expansion  of  the Oxbow National Wildlife Refuge. In November  1995, the  Massachusetts Government Land Bank requested an EDC for the remaining 3,400 acres (the  primary  portion  of the  main  and  north  posts,  which  consisted  of approximately 870 buildings, 6 million square feet of  building space, and all  utilities), and  agreed to pay $17.9 million over six years in six install› ments. The Gillette Company was constructing an $18 million warehouse and  distribution  center and  a  $50  million  plant,  while  Boston &amp; Maine Railroad  had  established a railhead  and transportation facility.  The reuse plan was expected to create 20,000 direct and 50,000 indirect jobs.

Tooele  City  Redevelopment  Agency  submitted  an  EDC  in  March 1996 for the entire 1,700 acres ofTooele Army Depot, which, since it was located outside of  a metropolitan area, qualified for a no-cost conveyance; this action enabled the Army to  avoid  $1.9 million  in  annual  costs. The 400,000 square foot  maintenance facility  and its equipment were trans› ferred to the redevelopment  agency,  subsequently  sold  to Penske Industries, and  used  to rebuild diesel  engines and  transmissions.  Within five years, 2,800 new jobs are expected to be created and, when the facil› ity reaches full operation, 3,800 jobs.

Closing many overseas bases was an essential element of transform› ing the Army from a forward-deployed force to a power-projection force. Due to worldwide commitments and the need to deploy troops around the world  as  speedily  as  possible,  not  all  overseas  bases  could  be  closed. Retaining only those installations that supported such a necessary forward

presence, the Army closed seven of  every ten overseas sites. By the begin› ning ofFY 97, European closures were about 97 percent complete, repre› senting the closure of 188  million  square feet of facilities,  equivalent to closing 12 of  the Army's largest installations. Base closures in Korea were 86 percent complete and  in Panama, 30 percent complete.

Under the terms of  the  1977 Panama Canal Treaty, all U.S. forces had to  be withdrawn and all property transferred to the Panamanian govern› ment by 31  December 1999. During FY 96, the U.S.  Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) conducted operations under a treaty implementation plan that  would  reduce  its  force  structure to  zero  by  1999  and  complete the transfer of military properties by  1997.  By the end of FY 96,  more than one-third  of all  Army  properties  had been  transferred  and the rest remained on schedule. In September 1996, Fort Amador, headquarters for U.S. Army, South (USARSO), reverted to Panama.

To  facilitate  the transfer  of  SOUTHCOM  from  Quarry  Heights, Panama, in  1997, the Secretary of  Defense, in March 1996, approved con› struction of a new headquarters building in Miami. USARSO was desig› nated DOD's Executive Agent for the move. While developing a compre› hensive plan to ensure an efficient transfer, USARSO also assumed more responsibility for operations  in  Panama. Joint Task Force Panama, a joint headquarters  enabling  in-country  crisis  or  contingency  response,  was commanded by the USARSO commanding general.

## Civilian Force

The new Plans and Strategies Division, Office of  the Deputy Assistant Secretary ofthcArmy (Civilian Personnel Policy), in June 1996 developed the Mid-Year  FY  96  Civilian  Personnel  Administration/Management (CPA/M)  Plan,  which  contained  strategies  and  goals  for  the  next  six months. In addition, the division also established, in August  1996, the FY 97- 98  CPA/M Strategic Plan,  which  provided  a framework  for  resource priorities. One purpose of  both documents was to ensure the full  partner› ship of  civilians in  the Army's future.

Efforts to streamline the civilian pers01mel system also occurred. By the  end  of FY  96,  the  Army  had  chosen  nine  of ten  sites  for  the  new regional  Civilian  Personnel  Operations  Centers  (CPOC)  and  hired  the regional directors. The  CPOCs  in Seckenheim,  Germany,  and  Fort Belvoir, Virginia, became fully operational in FY 96, while CPOCs at Fort Benning, Georgia; Aberdeen Proving Grot111d,  Maryland; and Fort Riley, Kansas,  were  opened.  CPOCs  in  Taegu,  South  Korea;  Rock  Island Arsenal, Illinois; Redstone  Arsenal,  Alabama;  and Fort Richardson, Alaska, were scheduled to open in early FY 97.

Under the concept of regionalized civilian personnel servicing, man› agers  and  commanders  were  given  the  capability  to process  personnel

actions, were  trained  to  use  new automated tools, and acquired account› ability  for  the personnel actions they processed. With the new division of labor,  personnel  specialists  at civilian  personnel  advisory  centers  were responsible  for  advising  managers and commanders on  their new  roles, while CPOC personnel accomplished personnel administration processing services. The Army attempted to educate its customers on civilian person› nel office regionalization through video teleconferencing, news bulletins, and brochures.

In  May 1996, the CSA issued a "white paper" emphasizing the impor› tance of  professional development of  Army civilian leaders. In June 1996, OSD  issued  revised senior grade targets lower than  what the  Army had programmed and assigned to MACOMs. During FY 96, the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of  the Army (Research, Development, and Acquisition) (OASA [RD&amp;A]) began a reengineering process to revitalize the civilian acquisition corps and integrate it with the military component to form a single Army Acquisition Corps. An integrated civilian/military acquisition career management structure and development of  a model for developing civilian  acquisition  leaders  were primary goals. Through  the Army Civilian Training, Education, and Development System (ACTEDS), the Army contributed $10.8 million to the competitive professional devel› opment of career employees and $19.9 million for civilian  leader devel› opment. The ACTEDS Intern Program increased minority and female rep› resentalion  within  the  civilian  workforce.  With  the  establishment of the Army's Civilian Personnel On-Line Home Page in FY 96, information on personnel,  training, jobs, and  communications became easily  accessible. In addition, the  Personnel Management Information and Support System, an  automated  personnel support system offering on-line technical advice about civilian personnel  management, became available.

The DOD Appropriations Act ofFY 1996 mandated that the Office of the Director of  Civilian Marksmanship, an Army activity under the Office of the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Logistics (ODCSLOG), be disestablished and that  its  assets, property,  and  records be transferred  to  a private  non› profit corporation. On 1 October 1996, the Corporation for the Promotion of  Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety replaced the Office of the Director of  Civilian Marksmanship.

## Management and Information Systems

## Personnel Management

As the Army  reached  its  drawdown end strength  in  FY 96, the  per› sonnel  community  decided  to  review  its  organizational  support, calling the process its "back-to-basics" program. In looking forward to providing

service  in  Force  XXI,  the  Army  used  the  "back-to-basics" program  to identify a foundation from which it could revolutionize personnel support. Although  the  basic structure  of personnel  service  support  was  deemed appropriate,  the  Army  recognized  that  it  needed  to  establish  preventive measures  to  eliminate  future  obstacles and enable future  improvements. At the same time, personnel service support to soldiers and theiJ· fami  ies I could not deteriorate. The Army was aiming toward providing a seamless coordination of personnel service support during peace, deployment,  and operations. Recent  peacekeeping  operations,  Army  participation in Partnership for  Peace (PfP) exercises  in  twelve  Eastern  European  coun› tries,  and  the  forward-deployed  presence  in  South Korea  tested  the  per› sorulel  service support system.

In  FY 96, PERSCOM developed  several  communications  initiatives to take  advantage  of new  technology  such  as  electronic  publication, client/server applications,  information  warfare,  and dish·ibuted systems. These new tools would allow personnel decision cycles to occur at a more rapid pace and, in  turn,  would reduce the time involved  in  the personnel lifecycle.  Operation ENGAGE for enlisted personnel management was one example ofPERSCOM's new communications u1itiatives.

FolJowing  the  successful  conclusion  of Operation  DESERT  STORM, Am1y  deployments  around  the  world  doubled.  Realizing  that excessive deployment could have a deleterious effect upon soldiers and their fami› lies, the Army established an unofficial ceiling of 120 days per year as the maximum that an  individual  or unit should  spend away  from home. To measure  individual  and unit  deployment,  the  Army  developed  PER› STEMPO (Personnel Tempo), where every day away from home counted toward  reaching that ceiling.  Army  leaders began  to  distribute  missions among a wider diversity of units to reduce the negative effects of  deploy› ments. To  prevent the same individuals with  highly desirable skills from being sent on constant deployment, the Army began to substitute soldiers with similar skills whenever possible.  Moreover, the Army made a con› certed  effort  to  reduce  the  number  of deployments  and  major  training exercises.  Surprisingly,  however,  soldier  retention  was  apparently  not affected negatively by the increased tempo of  deployments, since reenlist› ments occurred at a high  level.

The Army realized  it  must  maintain a  high  level  of  data accuracy to ensure that personnel service support could  be given as desired. To  man› age soldiers properly in  the personnel  lifecycle, as  well as  establish  per› sonnel policy,  managers needed to know exactly where an  individual sol› dier was stationed, what the soldier needed for future professional devel› opment,  and  when  the  soldier  was  due  for  reassignment  or schooling. Access to accurate and readily available personnel data enabled personnel managers  to  provide  units  with  appropriately  skilled  soldiers,  thereby

ensuring that unit missions could be accomplished. Improved forecasting skills, coupled with  access  to  accurate data, were expected to  permit the Army to synchronize requirements with available or projected pers01mel. In addition, data accuracy would assist in selecting the right programs and devising  appropriate  budgets  so  that  the  personnel  portion  of the  total Army budget (31  percent in  FY 96) was spent in a cost-effective manner.

The Standard Installation/Division Personnel System 3 (SIDPERS- 3) was  anticipated  to  be  the Army's prime catalyst for change  in  managing the  personnel  lifccycle.  A  new  tool  for  automating  personnel  actions, SIDPERS- 3 could push the Army toward its goal of  total  personnel  visi› bility.  SIDPERS- 3 would provide that necessary data accuracy and enable personnel  managers to know where a soldier was stationed, what job was being  performed,  and  when  the  soldier  should  be  moved.  Earlier  SID› PERS  versions  offered  weekly  updates  of information,  which  were  no longer sufficiently responsive for  personnel managers. As data input and access  to data  reached  real time, the  personnel  service  community required a new system that would provide more immediate feedback. SID› PERS- 3 would also permit personnel managers to compare and integrate personnel  lifecyclc data  from  the  hundred-plus systems  used  within  the personnel community. Reenlistment data could be used to predict recruit› ing needs; training school data could be used to identify soldiers for unit assignment; and  data  on  force  structure changes could  affect recruiting, training, and assignment procedures. With information more readily avail› able, personnel  managers and  leaders  would be more capable in  predict› ing and  meeting the Army's needs, as well as those of  its soldiers.

Throughout FY 96, the Army worked to develop SIDPERS- 3, which passed  its  OPTEC operational assessment at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland,  in  June  and  July  1996.  Initial  operational  fielding  of SlD› PERS- 3 occurred at Aberdeen Proving Ground in August  1996, and full fielding was expected to take place in April  1997. Although already a sig› nificant departure from  earlier SIDPERS versions, SJDPERS- 3 is a sys› tem that will allow for future  improvements.

In response  to Executive  Order J 2968, "Access  to Classified Information," released in August 1995, the Secretary of  Defense approved Change 3 to DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, in November  1995.  The  U.S.  Army  Central Personnel  Security  Clearance Facility  implemented  the  change  in  March  1996.  This  change,  which revised the guidelines for adjudicating security clearances, was a signifi› cant departure from previous policy. Adjudicators would now evaluate the "whole person" rather than  evaluating discrete  characteristics or experi› ences that might indicate a potential security risk. Permitting evaluators to apply the "whole person" concept could result in a broader interpretation of  disqualifying clements as well as mitigating circumstances. In addition,

the change revised due process, thereby expanding the rights of individu› als.  When  a  security clearance had been  denied or revoked,  the  change permitted individuals to  appear before an administrative judge and gave them  the  additional  right  to  appeal  the  judge's ruling.  These  changes, when initially adopted, lengthened security clearance adjudication beyond the lengthy process that already existed.

Without managing and using  personnel  resources  wisely,  the Army would  be unable to maintain readiness or conduct operations effectively. The Army recognized that it needed a new set of  technologies and systems to  be  able  to  identify  personnel  needs  accurately  and articulate  them  to OSD and Congress. With  Manpower Determination System, a workload management  system,  succeeding  levels  of leadership  would  add  their comments,  enabling  rapid  analysis  once  the  information  reached  the HQDA level. The system was tested in June 1996, followed by plans for development and application. After the Army Audit Agency (AAA) gives a comprehensive evaluation of the system, the Army anticipates that the Manpower Determination System will  be installed in several commands by FY 97.

The  Total Officer  Personnel  Management  Information  System  II (TOPMJS II) was part of  the Officer Personnel Management Directorate (OPMD) effort to improve access to and management of  officer personnel data. The Army expected that TOPMIS II would improve career manage› ment of  Army officers by their assignment officers, distribution managers, personnel service companies, and military personnel services worldwide. Services  available  on-line  for TOPMIS  II  users-primarily OPMD  and other  PERSCOM  offices-included  the  Officer  Record  Brief,  Officer Record  Detail,  Command  Slating  Stabilization  Break,  Goaling  and Monitoring, Cycle Validation, Field Interview, and Colonel's Assignment Sheet. TOPMIS users would, for example, be able to view Officer Record Briefs  on-line;  access  all officer  personnel  data  through  the  Officer Record Detail subsystem; access specific Acquisition Corps data and spe› cialized  reports;  and  slate  qualified  officers  for  command  positions.  A TOPMlS II development team of  military, civilian, and contractor person› nel was formed in February 1996 to reengineer the mainframe-based TOP› MIS, the existing version, into a client/server environment.

The Officer Evaluation Report (OER)  in use in FY 96 had  been in place for nineteen years. Although devised to be inflation proof, the OER had, over time, experienced insidious inflation. A survey of 1,500 officers demonstrated the consistent opinion that a new OER was needed desper› ately and  that all officers, regardless of  grade, should be evaluated in the same  format.  A  new  feature  on  the OER was a  section  identifying  the rated officer's  unique skills or areas of  expertise. The OER Support Form, which  has  been  in use  for two  decades,  facilitates  communications

between the rated officer and the rater by forcing them to identify clearly their expectations and goals. The officers who were surveyed highly rec› ommended that the OER Support Form be retained in whatever new OER system  was  developed.  A  new  form,  the Junior Officer Developmental Support Form (JODSF), was designed as  part of a new  leader develop› ment package to  assist junior officers  in  their  transition  into  the  Army. Aiding  subordinates  in  understanding  organizational  goals  would  be accomplished by a new requjrement for raters and senior raters to provide their own OER Support Forms to all officers at the next two lower levels. To ensure that senior raters could not rate the bulk of  their officers above average, the "Managed Profile Technique" was recommended as an infla› tion  control  tool  in the  new  system. The new  forms  were  tested  at  five overseas  locations  in  FY  96  and  were  well  received,  particularly  the JODSF.  Reaction  to  the  additional  counseling  required  as  part  of the JODSF was overwhelmingly positive.  Implementation  of the  new OER system was scheduled to occur on  l  October 1997.

Modernization  of  the  Officer  Personnel Management  System (OPMS), named OPMS XXI, was a yearlong effort to  change personnel management tools so that Army officers would be prepared to  meet nec› essary tasks in pursuit of  the Army mission. The Army was also reviewing the Enlisted Personnel Management System (EPMS) in FY 96 with a view towards  modernizing  it  the  following  year  in an  EPMS  XXI  review.  In both cases, the Army's  goal was to manage career paths effectively so that the  personnel  community  could  provide  correctly  trained  individuals when the Army needed them.

In  1995,  the  Army  Family  Action  Plan  General  Officer  Steering Commhtee decided that enlisted personnel management was  inefficient, obsolete, nonparticipatory, and reactive; the committee tasked the Enlisted Personnel Management Directorate (EPMD) to develop a  better system. At  the  time,  enlisted  soldiers  did  not  have  a  venue  for  interaction  with assignment managers or the opportunity to match their skills and prefer› ences with the Army's needs.  As  the  enlisted force decreased, the Army detennined that enlisted soldiers'  careers could be managed similarly to those of  officers.

In July  1995, the Army introduced Operation ENGAGE,  a set of  com› murucations initiatives designed to engage enlisted personnel in their own career  management.  The  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS) became operational  in  September 1995, enabling access to  any database and providing automated information on assignments, schools, and reten› tion.  The  IVRS  routinely  received  5,500  calls  daily.  In  June  1996,  the IVRS was updated to  include automated information on the Exceptional Family  Member,  Compassionate  Reassignment,  and Married  Army Couples  programs.  Additionally, in September 1995,  EPMD  career

branches  began  to  accept direct  fax  communications  from  soldiers and personnel offices, expediting processing time.  EPMD also designed new e-mail  addresses that readily  identified branch managers;  published and distributed EPMD pocket reference cards; and began sending 4,000 week› ly HQDA "PERSGRAMs" (letters formatted like telegrams) on important career issues directly to affected soldiers.

## Information Management

The  Information  Technology  Management  Reform  Act  (ITMRA), incorporated in the  National Defense  Authorization  Act  of  FY  96, required the appointment of a CIO in executive agencies; the CIO would report  to  that  agency's Chief Executive Officer. The Army  appointed a CIO to report to the Secretary of  the Army and began implementation of additional  requirements  mandated  by  ITMRA.  Executive agencies were further  directed to improve their business processes; develop interopera› ble information resources; develop information technology standards; and plan an interoperable command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) architecture that would eliminate functional "stovepipes"  and  cut  across  service  lines.  Designating  a  CIO  would enhance  the  Army's  information  technology  readiness.  The  Army Enterprise Strategy (AES), ten principles for achieving information supe› riority in wartime against any adversary, would more easily receive fund› ing and implementation with CIO support.

The Army's goal in information management was to develop a secure and interoperable  flow of  information  to warfighters.  The  Army Enterprise Architecture (AEA)  program attempted to  establish  seamless interoperability  and  to  digitize  the  battlefield,  building  upon  the  1993 Army Enterprise Vision and fulfilling the 1996 legislative requirement for an  information  technology  architecture.  Using  the  visions  and  require› ments of  war  fighters, AEA would develop a blueprint of  necessary future information systems that would also drive information technology invest› ment.  The  three  components  of the  AEA  were  the  Army  Operational Architecture-comprising missions, functions, tasks, information require› ments, and business rules; the Army Systems Architecture-consisting of the physical layout  of systems  and  communications;  and  the  Joint Technical  Architecture-Army (JTA-A~tablishing system  "building codes"  and  guidance  for joint and  combined  use.  The Army Technical Architecture (ATA) was signed in  January  1996, became the basis for the Joint Technical  Architecture  (JTA)  published  in August  1996,  and  then served as the Army's implementation of the JTA. Not only did AEA pro› vide  Force  XXI  and  the Army  After Next their information  teclmology architectures,  but it  is  designed  to  enable  the  attainment of information superiority. In addition, AEA will  be crucial for creating a digitized divi-

sion by 2000, a digitized corps by 2004, and a digitized active Army by 2010. Funding AEA was essential  for  achieving all  these goals,  and the Army  made  significant  progress  in  FY  96  toward  obtaining  necessary funds.

To provide the capability to  interact with other commands and agen› cies, PERSCOM  Information  Systems  Command  (PERSINSCOM) installed a video teleconferencing system in November 1995, albeit with outdated equipment from the Army  Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN). In April 1996, the old equipment was replaced by a new system. Frequent use by PERSINSCOM staff decreased TDY (temporary duty) costs and reduced time away from home station. In FY 96, PERSIN› SCOM added a new feature to the video teleconferencing system, which permitted communication with a larger array of  agencies. The system was scheduled  for  upgrading  by  June  1998  to  ensure  interoperability  with other DOD systems.

The handling of national security information was changed dramati› cally in April  1995  with  Executive  Order  12958.  New  guidelines  for review, downgrading, declassification, and  exemption from declassifica› tion created a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassi› fying information. Agencies were required  to review all classified infor› mation more than twenty-five years old and within permanent records for declassification  or  exemption.  If  not  reviewed,  documents  would  be declassified automatically in April 2000. With 270 million pages of  doc› uments to review at an estimated cost of $256 million, the Al.my estab› lished an Army Declassification Activity in June 1996.

In another  improvement  to information  management,  the  AAA upgraded its communications infrastructure in FY 96. AAA's DOS-based office automation system was replaced with Windows 95, petmitting real› time correspondence and providing Internet access. The AAA Information Management System (AIMS)  was converted from  a  UNIX-based mini› computer system with limited networking capabilities to a personal com› puter- based network  system. Additionally, training  applications that helped to identify training needs were added.

A  new  measurement  tool,  the  Installation  Status  Report  (ISR), would  allow  installation  commanders,  MACOMs,  and  HQDA  staff annua!Jy  to  assess  installation  management  against Army-wide  stan› dards.  The  ISR  was  expected  to  identify  requirements,  measure progress, and  assist in  resource allocation, as well  as eliminate numer› ous other reports.  ISR Part I, Infrastructure, was fielded  in FY 95; ISR Part II, Environment, in FY 96; and Part III, Services, is expected to be fielded in FY 98. Ratings were similar to those of  the Unit Status Report (USR), a monthly report on equipment and personnel readiness submit› ted by every Army unit. Acceptable readiness levels were designated CJ

and C2, or green; situations in  which  readiness problems were develop› ing were identified as C3, or amber; and C4, or red,  identified areas in which readiness had not been achieved. The first worldwide submission of  the ISR occurred in FY 96. ISR Part I reported the physical condition and  availability  of 219  major  facility  types  at  227 Army  installations worldwide; overall, they were rated C3. ISR Part II reported on the qual› ity of twenty-five environmental programs at 144 Army CONUS instal› lations, both active and reserve, with an overall C2 rating achieved. ISR Part JlJ  had  not yet been developed  by  the end of  FY 96. All  ISR data were compiled in the Headquarters Installation Status Report to be used above  the  installation  level  for  identifying deficiencies  and evaluating their effects upon mission performance.

The ODCSLOG initiated a seven-week program, the HQDA ODCS› LOG War on Equipment On-Hand (EOH) Shortages, in FY 96 to improve equipment  readiness  and  to  prevent  EOH  shortages  from  becoming  a commander's major concern.  When  ODCSLOG received  USR input,  it identified thirty EOH shortages and forwarded them to AMC. AMC, with its subordinate commands,  researched  the  issues and then  hosted  an  in› progress review to obtain a coordinated resolution from affected agencies and commands. This became the Army Materiel Status System, with pro› gram execution scheduled to begin in FY 98.

To  identify  any  possible  vulnerabilities that digitization  might  cause in  Force XXI, the CSA directed  that a full  range of information warfare attacks be conducted to reveal any such weaknesses and that appropriate countermeasures be developed.  In May  1995, the U.S. Army Intelligence Center established an Information  Operations Task Force,  which  devel› oped  an inf ormation  operations  war  game  that  was  conducted  in November 1995. The regional conflict scenario involved eighty-two par› ticipants from twenty-seven Army and joint organizations in a corps-level exercise.  Results  were  briefed  to  Army  leaders  in  January  1996 and an after-action plan was developed to resolve issues. In conjunction with the Director of Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers and the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations (ODCSOPS), the Intelligence Center created the C2 Protect Management Plan in a broader attempt to assess Army vulnerabil› ities with respect to information technology.

## Automation Systems

The Army Recruiting and Accession Data System (ARADS) collected information on evety Army enlistee, both active and reserve, and forward› ed  it to  the  Total  Army  Personnel  Data  Base (TAPDB)  and  to  recruiters. Applicant  processing  information  was  obtained  electronically  from  the Military Entrance Processing Command, while training school reservations

were received through the KEYSTONE RECRUIT Quota System. During FY 96, the base year of  the extended ARADS contract, a major engineering change proposal was planned. Additionally,  a migration strategy permitted ARADS  to  function  on  new  client/server  equipment  until the Joint Recruiting  Information  Support  System  was implemented.  Integrating ARADS  into  the  Army  Personnel  System  architecture  was  expected  to improve standardization, efficiency, accuracy, and performance.

The  KEYSTONE  System,  an  interactive  on-line  personnel  system supporting  thousands  of Army  users  worldwide,  supplied  critical  auto› mated tools for accession, training, assignment, retention, reclassification, and mobilization. KEYSTONE was originally run on a contractor's  main› frame, but in an effort to  reduce costs, PERSINSCOM in FY 95 acquired a mainframe for the Army that duplicated the contractor's. By December 1995,  KEYSTONE was operated solely on the government mainframe. The system was aging, however, and not meeting the needs of  the person› nel  community.  KEYSTONE application software was being redesigned in FY 96 and converted to the client/server environment to accommodate more users and permit more capabilities.

KEYSTONE  REQUEST,  a  subsystem  of KEYSTONE  fielded  in 1972 and written  in  FORTRAN, was used to make training reservations and unit assignments for all Army enlistees. Information on slots available for  training  was  obtained  from  the  Army  Training  and  Requirements System. When soldiers  left  the  active Army  with  service commitments, ARNG vacancies for them could only be found by making telephone calls. To improve  this transition, the Guard  fielded the National  Guard Automated Unit Vacancy System during FY 95 and 96. States sent week› ly  lists of  vacancies  to  the Guard  for consolidation; the consolidated list was then posted on the KEYSTONE REQUEST host, where it was acces› sible  to  users  worldwide.  Software changes to  KEYSTONE REQUEST had been written in several computer languages over time, making future changes increasingly difficult. An expanding base of  users, however, made improvements  essential.  To  provide  better support and  to  enable  faster software  updates,  the  KEYSTONE  REQUEST  subsystem  was  being migrated to a client/server environment.

Programming  for  the  Reserve  Statistics  and  Accounting  System (RSAS) was completed  and  moved  into  production  in  FY 96. Approval was pending on some functional elements ofRSAS, while other elements had  already  been  implemented. The purpose of RSAS  was  to  replace a myriad  of systems-Consolidated Army  Reserve  Strength  Accounting System,  Strength  Accounting  System,  Reserve  Component  Common Personnel Data System, Training  Requirements  Generator  System,  and Duplicate Social Security Number System. RSAS used the resources of the Total Army Personnel  Data Base-Reserve (TAPDB-R)  to  report the

Army Reserve's personnel  strength. The Defense  Manpower  Center,  as well as many other DOD and Army clients, used RSAS information.

The  purpose  of  the Standard  Installation  Division Personnel System- United States Army Reserve (SIDPERS-USAR)-Migration was to  provide  automated  personnel  management  information  for  Troop Program Units (TPU) by migrating the system to the TAPDB-R. TPU data had been maintained  in  a separate database from the rest of the  reserve force. Personnel and organization data were coded by users and transmit› ted electronically to SIDPERS-USAR, where they were edited for validi› ty  and  compatibility.  Documents  produced  by the  system  for  personnel and administrative support were given to MACOMs, Major United States Army Reserve Commands (MUSARC), and TPU users.  During FY 96, flmctional  description  and  requirements  documents  for  the  SIDPERS› USAR  migration  were  completed.  Migrating  SIDPERS-USAR  to TAPDB-R would allow users to access information on TPU and non-TPU soldiers from a single source.

The Retirement Point Accounting System (RPAS), originally devel› oped as an on-line and real-time program for the Army Reserve Personnel Command (ARPERSCOM), acquired data from the TAPDB-R but  was unable to interface with the systems of  other TAPDB-R users. The ongo› ing transition  of  ARPERSCOM, which would result in  fewer personnel, precipitated the decision to redesign RPAS. The new system supplied stan› dardized data from which other ARPERSCOM automated personnel sys› tems  could  obtain  information. In addition  to interface  ability, the redesigned  RPAS  offered  new  functions  for  tracking,  reporting,  and accounting for retirement points.

The Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), an automated information service that identified individuals who were eligi› ble for military benefits, was developed in 1979 to reduce fraud and abuse of military health care. The Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS), fielded in  1985, acquired data on fami› ly  member  entitlements  from  DEERS,  ensuring  that  benefits  listed  on identification cards were correct. Since then, however, significant changes in entitlements and  technology reduced the efficacy of  the DEERS data› base,  necessitating  a  redesign  of DEERS  and  RAPIDS.  In  November 1995,  a  committee  was  formed  to  design  the  Enrollment  Eligibility RAPIDS Reconciliation. Revocation of privileges could now be noted in the  system,  and  the  DEERS  database  was  automatically  updated  when new identification cards were issued. Fielding of  and training on the new system  occurred  at  Fort  Belvoir,  Virginja,  on 28  September  1996,  with DOD testing beginning on 30 September.

The  U.S.  Transportation  Command's Joint Transportation  Corporate Information Management Center was appointed to accelerate implementa-

tion of  DOD transportation migration systems by March 1997, in response to a  1993 Deputy Secretary of  Defense directive. In November 1995, DOD designated  the  Army  to  develop  the  Joint Transportation  Coordinators Automated Information for Movements System (TC AIMS II) to enhance installation transportation and unit movement automation, replacing exist› ing  movement information  systems. The Marine Air-Ground Task Force 11/Logistics Automated Information System became the migration solution for  unit  movement.  The  Army  Transportation  Coordinators  Automated Command Control Information System (TC ACCIS) module for rail load› ing  and  the  DA  Movement  Management  System- Redesign  section  for planning convoys were the models for the unit move function. Finally, the Air Force's Cargo Movement Operations System was selected as the sys› tem  for  the  installation  transportation office. The TC AIMS  II  transition office of twenty joint military and civilian  personnel  was  established  in January  1996.  In August  1996, funding  for TC AIMS  II was transferred from  the Air Force and Marine Corps to the Army. The Army transferred $15.5 million from TCACCIS; the Air Force contributed $17.9 million and the Marine Corps $3.0 million. Combining the services' best systems, TC AlMS 11  was  expected to  provide common deployment and daily  opera› tional automation  tools,  as well  as in-transit  visibility  data  to  DOD  sys› tems, such as the global transportation network.

Significant  efforts  to  modernize  the  U.S.  Army  Central  Personnel Security Clearance Facility's (CCF) automation systems began in FY 96. The Information Processing Center supporting CCF began migrating the Clearance Management System to an open system operating environment. PERSCOM obligated FY 97  funds  for  software development, computer maintenance,  workstation  upgrades,  and  telecommunications  upgrades. The latter two upgrades were essential for compatibility with new Defense Investigative  Service  automation  that  is  to  begin  providing  electronic investigation reports instead of  hard-copy ones in FY 97.

The Total Army Personnel System (TAPSYS) was a contract provid› ing  for  automated data processing services,  including software  develop› ment and  personnel  systems support, to ODCSPER. The  first TAPSYS contract, which ran from April 1989 to September 1994, was a cost-plus› fixed-fee contract, with work assigned to the contractor via work orders. TAPSYS- 2 was signed in August 1994 and permitted both level-of-effort (where requirements were not well known and purchases were made for a specified number of work hours) and completion delivery orders (where requirements were well  defined and purchase was made at a guaranteed price). TAPSYS- 2, with a five-year life span and an approved ceiling of $11 1 million, supplied automated services ranging from help-desk opera› tions  to  client/server  migration  support.  In  FY  96,  thirty-six  delivery orders were issued, at a value of  $25 million.

When PERSINSCOM reorganized in  1994, the Plans and Operations Directorate acquired  the  Project 80X (later named Personnel  Enterprise System- Automation  [PES-A]) office.  By mid-1996, the 80X ll contract desperately required extension, and PES-A was established as a separate organization to accomplish this. PES-A concluded over 30 contract docu› ments, saving $40.7 million of  the original system cost and adding 6 years to  the program. At the same time, PES-A began to develop replacement alternatives for the 80X II, which were scheduled to be completed before February 1997.

The  National  Guard  Bureau  (NGB)  operating  system  in  1996,  an IBM Multiple Virtual System/Extended Architecture on an Amdahl 5850 computer, was being eliminated from vendor maintenance the following year.  PES-A,  responsible  for  ensuring  hardware  compatibility  among Army  personnel  commands,  negotiated  with IBM and added  the  NGB Multiple Virtual  System/Extended  Systems  Architecture  to  the  PES-A contract for $241,000. The migration of  the NGB Headquarters operating system enhanced processing ability and reduced NGB maintenance costs 25  percent.

The AES  contained  an  objective  for  power  projection  of the  com› mand,  control,  communications,  and  computer  infrastructure  (PPC4I). This was to be accomplished through digitizing communications at select› ed installations via hardware and cable upgrades, system interoperability, and software development. During FY 96, PPC4I efforts concentrated on modernizing local area networks (LAN) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Lewis, Washington; and Fort Bliss, Texas.  Work progressed on LANs at Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Stewart, Georgia, with  completion scheduled for late 1996.  Telephone  switches  were  replaced  at  Fort  Stewart  and upgraded at Fort Hood, Fort Bliss, and Kwajalein Atoll. At Fort Campbell, Fort Lewis, and  Fort Benning, Georgia, switches were expanded. Cable rehabilitation projects were awarded  at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Hood, Fort Stewart, Fort Campbell, Fort Lewis, and Fort Bliss. Switch and cable projects would be operational in FY 97. Another technology inser› tion program relied on the installation of  larger capacity servers to support an increased Defense Information Systems Network bandwidth. Progress through FY 96 was considerable and was expected to remain on schedule in FY 97. Additional funding was required to keep the program on sched› ule through FY 97 and FY 98.

Pay  issues  also  received  attention  in  the  automation  arena.  In  April 1996, AAA became a pilot agency under the program to reengineer DOD travel,  which  resulted  in  an  automated  travel  process.  Up  to  this  point, DOD had processed travel orders and vouchers manually. ODCSPER led a team to develop an electronic  interface between  the military personnel system  and  the  standard  military  pay  system.  Immediate  results  would

include more accurate pay transactions  and  a  reduction in  military  pay workload and costs. AAA had recommended such an interface previously and sent representatives to  serve on the team to ensure that appropriate management controls were instituted.

Use  of the  International  Merchants  Purchase  Authorization  Card, issued to  36,114 Army civilians  and soldiers  for local purchase transac› tions of $2,500 or less, grew 78 percent in FY 96 as the number of  card transactions increased from 921,000 in FY 95 to 1.6 million in FY 96. As purchases with the card grew in FY 96  from a value of $427 million to $740 million and use of  purchase orders declined, the Army saved nearly $120 million. According to an audit by AAA, the card saved an average of $92 when used in place of  a purchase order. The greatest saving occurred in contracting offices (  46 percent), with other savings in supply (22 per› cent), budget ( 19 percent), and requesting (12 percent) organizations. The Army remained the largest single federal user of the card. The Assistant Secretary  of the Army  (Financial  Management  and Comptroller)  (ASA [FM&amp;C]) established a team to review practices associated with the card and to streamline and modify them as necessary.

## Budget

## Economies and Efficiencies

The NPR of 1995  emphasized results, customer satisfaction, decen› tralization, and mission focus. In response, the Army implemented more economical  and  effective  methods  to  accomplish  its  mission  with decreased resources. Cost-cutting initiatives consisted of  streamlining the workforce, improving customer service, initiating acquisition reform, and reducing regulations. Under the NPR charter permitting reinvention labo› ratories, agencies could test new methods without red tape. In FY 96, the Army designated FORSCOM and  the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) as DOD's only reinvention centers, which permitted them to coordinate directly with DOD for desired legislative changes.

MACOM efforts to reengineer and redesign forces were orchestrated to eliminate unnecessary levels and functions. Top-to-bottom assessments of institutional processes in all functional  areas were expected to reduce nonessential functions, reallocate resources, and possibly reduce the num› ber of  MACOMs. Comprehensive reviews of  all headquarters field oper› ating and staff  support agencies were conducted with? view toward reduc› ing their number and privatizing functions where possible. New initiatives in  acquisition  and modernization were  identified  to  increase  efficiency and effectiveness.

The  FY  97- 0 I  POM  update  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  Army could not sustain essential modernization,  improve  quality  of life,  and maintain an end strength of  495,000 active duty personnel without addi› tional resources. The Army established a senior-level Efficiency Working Group, headed by ODCSOPS, to generate significant annual savings by reducing costs, conserving resources, reengineering the force, and adopt› ing sound  business practices. The Cost and Economic Analysis Center and AAA reviewed and validated proposals made by the working group, and, after approval  by senior leaders, the Army was  expected to imple› ment new initiatives.

The Total Army  Quality  management philosophy,  adopted in  1992, resulted  in organizations  that anticipated and led change within FY 96.

The  1995 President's Quality Award Program honored five federal  orga› nizations  for  their  improvements  in  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness. Three  of  the five honorees  were  Army  organizations,  and  all  three belonged  to  AMC.  The  Red  River  Army  Depot  and  the  Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center both won in the Quality Improvement  Prototype  category.  The  Tank-Automotive  Research, Development, and Engineering Center won in  the  Presidential category. To further improve quality management, the Army implemented the Army Performance  Improvement  Criteria,  based  on  the  Malcolm  Baldridge National Quality Award, which assess an organization's total operation.

The  Manpower  and  Personnel  Integration  (MANPRINT)  initiative that enabled the Army to design future systems around the user and to cal› culate effects on operators,  maintainers, units, and  the  whole force  con› tinued in  FY 96.  Balancing system design against life-cycle costs, force structure requirements,  and  combat effectiveness,  MANPRINT defined personnel  requirements,  minimized  redesign,  improved training, and enhanced soldier safety, health, and survivability.  MANPRINT helped  in the design of  the cockpit of  the Comanche helicopter so that it supported the  full  range of  size  and  motion of  male and female  pilots. The use of modular components decreased maintenance requirements and damage to surrounding  components.  By  applying  the  MANPRINT  process,  the Army saved more than $3  billion.

Integrated Sustainment Maintenance (ISM) combined all active and reserve component general support maintenance units, installation logis› tics  directorates, maintenance depots, and defense maintenance contrac› tors under a single management structure. Army sustainment maintenance workloads  were  centrally  managed,  maintenance  and  repair  activities streamlined, costs reduced, and the Army's  sustaining base repair capabil› ity  maximized. A successful test program in  I  994 was expanded in  1995. Army leaders were expected to approve implementation of  ISM through› out the Army later in  1996.

## Legislation

The Army progressed  in  developing acquisition practices  similar to those of  commercial business and in transforming its processes to results› oriented  program  management  and  performance  budgeting.  Numerous pieces of  legislation both mandated and furthered this transition.

The new era of financial  management reform began with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of I  990, enacted to improve federal agency accountability  and  financial  reporting  to  provide  decision  makers  with accurate  and  timely financial  information.  All  federal  agencies  were required to appoint a CFO to centralize financial management, to prepare audited annual financial statements (which differed significantly from tra-

ditional  federal  financial  reporting),  and  to  modernize  their  financial information systems. The CFO Act exchanged vertical management for horizontal management, in an effort to eliminate "stovepipes" and permit better decisions at lower levels. Designated a pilot agency under the CFO Act, the Army had prepared audited annual financial statements since FY 91  on all Army funds. As did other agencies, the Army experienced diffi› culty  in  preparing  the  financial  statements,  since  its  financial  systems remained based on appropriations (to accommodate the budget process). Due to  the CFO Act, the Army revised its policies on physical inventory and the valuation of assets,  incorporated outcome-oriented performance measures, and restructured its management control process.

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 built on  the  CFO Act's mandate to  use  accurate financial  data  for  measuring performance  and  managing  functional  programs.  To  improve  program effectiveness and  hold  federal  agencies accountable for program results, GPRA required the development of strategic plans (by September  1997 for  FY  98),  annual  performance  plans  for  every  budget  activity  (by September 1997 for FY 99), and annual  performance reports (beginning March 2000). The annual financial reports required by the CFO Act and the annual performance reports required by the GPRA would be consoli› dated  into  one  annual  report  comparing actual resources  with  achieved results. To ensure that performance measures would be developed to com› pare requested resources with results, the GPRA designated seventy pilot projects. The Army's three project agencies were the U.S. Army Research Laboratory,  the  U.S. Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (COE)  Civil  Works National  Operation  and  Maintenance  Program,  and AAA.  Through  its project, AAA decided it needed to deliver services more efficiently to cus› tomers and identified their needs through interviews and  surveys.  In  FY 96, AAA submitted its report, "Applying the Principles of  the Govenunent Performance  and  Results  Act  and  Strategic  Planning  to  the  Inspector General/  Audit  Function,"  based  on  its  role  as  a  pilot  project,  to  the President's  Management Council as a case study on strategic planning and performance measurement.

The  Government  Management  Reform  Act  (GMRA)  of 1994 also resulted  from  NPR  recommendations.  Another piece  of legislation,  the Federal Financial Management Act of 1994, required aJI agencies covered by the CFO Act to submit audited financial statements, beginning FY 96, as well  as  a  consolidated  government-wide  audited  financial report, beginning  FY  97.  GMRA  authorized  the  Office  of Management  and Budget (OMB) to adjust the frequency, due dates, and reporting require› ments  on  a  test  basis.  The Senate  Committee on  Governmental Affairs encouraged  OMB  to  consolidate  or  adjust  financial  reporting  require› ments of  numerous laws, a concept the Army had long supported.

Several  legislative  acts  improved  the  changes  made  by  the  Federal Acquisition  Streamlining Act  (FASA) of 1994,  which  mandated  imple› mentation of  NPR  recommendations.  The  ITMRA  and  the  Federal Acquisition  Reform Act (FARA) of 1996 recognized the importance of information  technology for effective government. These two acts, known as the Clinger-Cohen Act, provided opportunities to streamline and reduce unnecessary steps in the acquisition process. FARA provided contracting officers  increased  flexibility  when  contracting  for  commercial items, authorizing the  use of  simplified  acquisition procedures to procure com› mercial  supplies  and  services  in  amounts  greater  than  the  simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) of  $100,000 but less " than $5 million. This has resulted in a reduction of  administrative and overhead costs and has elim› inated  some  governmental  barriers  to  industry.  Moreover,  when  a  con› tracting activity is  implementing an electronic commerce/electronic data interchange, the act allows the use of  simplified acquisition procedures for all  requirements between $50,000 and $100,000. The Clinger-Cohen Act permitted DOD to focus on information technology resources, to reduce acquisition time, and to develop sound acquisition strategies.

Under the CIO Act of 1996, federal agencies were required to appoint a  CIO to  develop,  maintain,  facilitate,  evaluate, and  assess  information systems. Federal agencies gained more flexibility in acquiring information technology. The CIO would work with the agency's  CFO to develop a reli› able, consistent, and  timely accounting, financial, and asset management system. The CIO Act gave each federal agency more flexibility  in  infor› mation technology acquisition.

The FFMIA of 1996 required federal agencies to develop and main› tain  fina ncial  management systems  that complied  with  federal  require› ments.  FFMIA  supplied  uniform  accounting  standards;  required  full financial  disclosure;  was built upon  the  CFO, GPRA, and GMRA Acts; and  enabled  agencies to  measure  spending against results. Agency  sys› tems would  be  audited  for  compliance,  and  agency  heads would  report remedial actions to Congress.

To establish accounting standards for federal agencies and other users of  federal financial information,  the  Federal  Accounting  Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) was created. The FASAB issues these standards under  the  title  "Statements  of Federal  Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFFAS)  and  Concepts,"  but  they  are  more  commonly  called  Federal Generally Accepted Principles (FEDGAAP). FEDGAAP issued in FY 96 were:  Accounting  for  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment;  Accmmting  for Revenue and Other Financing Sources; and Supplementary Stewardship Reporting. During FY 96,  OMB  revised  its  Federal  Hierarchy  of Accounting  Guidance  for  the  following:  SFFAS  and  Concepts;  OMB interpretations  on FASAB  standards;  OMB  guidance  on  Form  and

Contents; Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and other authorita› tive standards.

Army efforts at acquisition reform  were  guided  by  NPR initiatives. The Army gave program executive officers and program managers direct authority  to  expend  resources,  eliminated  unique  government  require› ments  for  Army  contracts,  mandated  compUance  with  the  ATA,  and reduced  data  and  management  reports  in  Army  contracts.  Rather  than specifying exactly how an item should be manufactured, the Army identi› fied  performance  measures  for  systems.  This  allowed  manufacturers  to meet Army standards  while maintaining  flexibility  and creativity  in  the production process, ultimately lowering Army costs. The Army also estab› lished a preference for commercial  items, which generally cost much less than  items  made  to  unique  military  specifications.  The  Direct Vendor Delivery  program  permitted vendors  to  deliver directly  to  the  ultimate consumer,  saving  the  Tank-Automotive  and  Armaments  Command  $45 million on tire purchases. By pm·chasing items from  the commercial sec› tor,  rather  than  developing  them,  the Army  saved  $400  million.  MED› COM the Prime Vendor concept, which permitted a single supplier to dis› tribute  a  specified class of  commercial  supplies in  a  given  geographical area  based on orders that  were submitted electronically,  reducing Army storage costs.

UnderFASA, the Army streamlined and reengineered acquisition pro› grams, reducing documentation, oversight, and barriers to private industry as well as providing new equipment to soldiers more quickly. Cooperative Research  and  Development Agreements  served  as  new  mechanisms  to transfer  technology  between  the Army,  academia,  and  private  industry. TECOM developed  the  virtual  proving  ground,  which was  expected  to reduce acquisition risk by  using virtual  prototypes before building actual systems.

DOD  revision  of  acquisition  regulations represented  dramatic changes in acquisition reform and implemented fully  the FASA. The new policies incorporated the recommendations of the  1995 Commission on Roles and  Missions of the Armed  Forces, stating a  clear preference for contractor-provided logistics support and directing that joint programs be consolidated  and  collocated  at  the  lead  component's  program  office. Revisions minimized mandatory directions and encouraged program man› agers  to  tailor acquisition strategies.  Additionally,  acquisition  policy for weapons systems and automated information systems was integrated, pro› viding common guidance and  oversight for software-intensive  weapons systems.  Mandatory  acquisition  procedures  were  established  only  for major  programs,  permitting  services  to  manage  their  own  programs. Integrated product teams were institutionalized, bringing representatives of all  functional  disciplines  together  to  develop  successful  programs,

resolve issues, and facilitate decision making.  In addition to a significant reduction  in  the size of  acquisition  regulations from  1,000 pages to  160, the  number  of mandatory  standard  report  formats  was  decreased.  The acquisition decision process was simplified by eliminating the Milestone IV decision  point, stating a preference for one production review by  the Defense Acquisition Board, and delegating the second production review to the military services.

On Acquisition  Reform Acceleration Day, 31 May  1996, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Reform)  launched the new  on› line Commercial Advocates Forum on the Internet to accelerate the acqui› sition of commercial items,  use of commercial practices, and elimination of  barriers. DOD's  entire acquisition community ceased normal operations for the day and focused on institutionalizing acquisition reform initiatives. Commanders and managers educated their personnel on pertinent acquisi› tion reform changes, conducted open discussions, and supplied DOD with feedback  for  future  improvements.  In  1996, DOD  conducted acquisition reform training through eleven  interactive satellite broadcasts on  subjects such as FASA implementation, the SAT, the Federal Acquisition Computer Network, the Single Process Initiative, the Overarching and Working-level Integrated Product  Team Process, and the Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data  Interchange.  The Army  trained  more  than  five  thousand personnel through its acquisition training seminars and began to develop career train› ing programs for Army acquisition personnel.

## Accountability

The Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) pooled  their  resources  to  resolve  issues  identified  in  past audits  and  to improve  the  reliability  of financial  data.  Joint  financial  and  functional teams  were  developing  and  implementing  interim  measures  to  address system deficiencies such as  inadequate interfaces between personnel pay and property systems and the accounting system. The Army's accounting system relied on a series of  field subsystems fed  from an array of inven› tory, property, procurement, payroll, accounts payable, and other manage› ment information systems. Conversion from  the Standard Army Civilian Payroll System to the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) was complet› ed  in FY 96. Active and reserve components were already being paid by one systemthe Defense Joint Military Pay System. AAA representatives served on a DOD team that evaluated the Corps of Engineers Financial Management  System,  used  to  perform  accounting  for  the  Corps  of Engineers. The team planned to review test results to determine if  the sys› tem could be used as a standard accounting system for DOD.

Cash  management initiatives resulting from joint efforts between the Army and DFAS  included encouraging civilian and military personnel to

be  reimbursed  for  travel  vouchers  via  Direct  Deposit/Electronic  Fund Transfer. Other initiatives involved educating Army vendors on the bene› fits  of payment via  Direct Deposit/Electronic Fund Transfer;  expanding credit  card  purchases for  small-dollar items; and  reviewing commissary change funds and returning excess funds to the Treasury.  In addition, the Army decreased cash payment advances for official travel by promoting use of  the government charge card. These initiatives allowed the Army to reduce the cash it held, decreasing Treasury costs.

A  visible  cash  management  initiative  resulted  from  the  Prompt Payment Act, which required vendors to be paid on time to avoid late pay› ment interest penalties.  In  1996, the Army incurred interest on only  .01 percent of  disbursements subject to the Prompt Payment Act; the goal was to  incur interest on no  more than .02 percent. In addition, the Army took advantage of  87 percent of  all discounts offered by vendors in 1996.

Debt management, which had grown noticeably on the heels of  demo› bilization and downsizing, was an important element of the Army' s stew› ardship over public funds. Debt from former soldiers represented a signif› icant portion of  the total funds due to the Army. In FY 96, the Army insti› tuted  policy  changes and  systems  improvements  that  decreased  former soldier debt from 52 percent of  the total funds due to the Army in  1995 to 40 percent in  1996.

During  FY  96,  eliminating  problem  disbursements  was  one  of the highest priorities of  the Under Secretary of  Def ense (Comptroller). DFAS used a centralized clearance system that allowed one installation to make disbursements  citing  another  installation's  funds tlu-ough  intraservice transactions,  interfund  billings,  and  cross-disbursements.  This  system, however, produced problem disbursements, which adversely affected the accuracy of  accounting reports, determination of  the availability of  funds, and rapid research and  resolution  of discrepancies. Since the Army con› ducted  a significant portion of its  transactions via  the DFAS centralized clearance system, problem  disbursements were a  particular problem  for the Army.

During  FY  96,  the  financial  management  and  legal  communities made significant progress  in  bringing Antideficiency Act (ADA)  viola› tions  to closure.  The Army  had  sixteen potential ADA violations under investigation as of 30 September 1996.  Of  the cases completed in FY 96, only one was determined to  be a violation of the act.  Under the Military Construction Act of 1994, expenditure of military construction funds  for certain  cost-plus-fixed-fee  contracts required  prior  approval  by the Secretary  of Defense.  A  violation  of this  restriction  resulted  in  a  case totaling more than $100 million. The Military Construction Appropriations Act of 1996  removed  the restriction. The ADA  tracking system was revised,  adding visibility to the process, and an ADA primer

on the ASA (FM&amp;C) web page increased awareness of fiscal constraints and ADA violations.

The ASA (FM&amp;C) Business Practices Office implemented a finan› cial  management  waiver  program  in  FY  94.  A  waiver  would  give MACOM and installation commanders the authority to implement or test financial  management  improvements  that  were otherwise restricted  by OSD or Army regulations. The specific objective was to identify ways to generate  revenues,  reduce  costs,  streamline  financial  procedures,  and develop operations similar to  those  used in  commercial  business.  From FY 94 through FY 96, forty waiver requests were submitted. By the end of  FY 96, 26 of  those had  been approved, 2 were still in  process, and 12 had been withdrawn because they required legislative action or were not supported by Army headquarters. Of  the 40 waiver requests, 7 were sub› mitted in FY 96, of  which 5 were approved, 1 remained in process, and l was withdrawn.

Improvements in the core competencies of  technology generation and application, acquisition excellence, and logistics power projection brought on by a need to accomplish the mission with fewer resources, sharpened AMC's focus as the Army changed from a forward-deployed to a power› projection force. Technology generation and application  underwent inno› vative changes, such as a significant increase in the number of advanced internal and external partnerships. In the core competency for acquisition excellence,  AMC  identified  half of the  established  specifications  and standards  for  elimination  or conversion  to  commercial  standards,  and conducted 40 percent of  its business electronically. In logistics power pro› jection,  new  ideas  such  as  total  asset  visibility,  integrated  sustainment maintenance,  single  stock  fund,  and  velocity  management  were  intro› duced.

As a  pilot agency  under GPRA,  AAA conducted  a continuous self› assessment process  during  FY  96.  AAA  concluded  that,  following  the Army's significant restructuring during BRAC, the Force XXI initiatives, and the HQDA Redesign, the agency was no longer synchronized with the rest  of the  Army. In March  1996,  the  Auditor  General  announced  that AAA would  be restructured. Army auclitors  had  been  traveling  to  field locations  to  interview  managers  and  collect  data,  and  travel  costs  had risen. AAA designed its restructuring to support tbe new concentration of forces and decision centers that had resulted from  the Army's restructur› ing. Offices  at  Fort  Riley, Kansas;  Fort  Sill, Oklahoma;  Natick Laboratories, Massachusetts;  Chambersburg, Pennsylvania;  and  Wilkes› Barre, Pennsylvania, were closed. AAA decreased the size of  another ten offices and increased  staffing  at three offices.  No  significant personnel reductions were planned. In a cost-cutting measure, AAA decided to con› duct agency schools  in  partnership with other audit agencies.  In  FY 96,

AAA  and  the  Air  Force  Audit  Agency  developed  a Leadership Development Course to be offered in FY 97.

Throughout FY 96, AAA played a vital role by performing audits in the  following  areas:  acquisition,  research  and development,  manpower, reserve affairs, financial management, logistics, environment, civil works, operations, personnel, intelligence, security, training, readiness,  informa› tion management, and health care. These audits resulted in potential mon› etary benefits of approximately $427  million.  The May  1996 "Audit of Reduced Price Initiative," on the Army effort to reduce supply stockage to save costs, showed that implementing the reduced  price initiative saved $68.2 million in  1994.  If the selection  criteria had  been  different or the number of items covered had been increased to 400, the audit stated, the initiative  could  have  saved  an  additional  $67.9  million.  The  July  1996 "Audit of Contracting for  Defense  Environmental  Restoration  Account Projects" showed that too many activities shared responsibility for award› ing contracts. The audit also identified potential savings of  $58.4 million. The April  1996 "Audit of  Total Asset Visibility" stated the Army had not integrated  its  total  asset  visibility  capability  into  its  decision-making process.  As  a result, the Army might be missing opportunities to reduce costs associated with acquisition, repair, and redistribution of  equipment, but potential savings were not measurable.

The  Army's  sixth  consecutive  annual  financial  statement  audit occurred in FY 96. The audit identified as progress the establishment of  a DOD-wide  Real  Property  Integrated  Process  Team,  development  of a method for revaluing unserviceable equipment, and institution of  ARNG financial  reporting  initiatives.  Other improvements consisted of submis› sion of inventory adjustments to  improve statement accuracy,  persistent efforts to reduce obligations, and the implementation of  the velocity man› agement concept. The audit identified as deficiencies the lack of  integrat› ed,  transaction-driven general ledgers;  the absence  of recording  holding gains  and  losses  in  the  inventory;  improper pricing or categorization of wholesale  equipment;  inappropriate  values  established  for  government property; and unreliable dollar values for accounts payable. Audit recom› mendations  increased  the  quality of financial  statements and  facilitated implementation of  the CFO Act;  GMRA; OMB and DOD guidance; and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

## Budget

The Army's  TOA of$64.9 billion for FY 96 was not yet the end of  the budget reductions that began in FY 86. The FY 97 budget was expected to decrease further, to $60.1  billion, and then rise slightly to $60.4 billion in FY  98.  The  Army's share  of the  DOD  budget  averaged  26.3  percent

between FY 89 and FY 96 but was scheduled to decrease to 23.6 percent between FY 97 and 0 I. Table  I indicates the FY 96 appropriation by cat› egory.

The Military Personnel, Army (MPA), budget in FY 96 was $20.3 bil› lion  for  the  active Army.  The  personnel  budgets for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve were $3.3 billion and $2.1  billion, respectively. The active Army decreased from 508,600 personnel in FY 95 to 491,100 in FY 96, short of  its J 993  Bottom-Up Review goal of  495,000 in FY 96. The Guard declined from 374,900 soldiers in FY 95 to 370,000 in FY 96, close to  reaching  its  expected drawdown  strength of 367,000 in  FY 97. The  Reserve  strength  was  241,300  troops  in  FY  95;  it  decreased  to 226,200 in FY 96 and was scheduled to stabilize at 208,000 in FY 98. The Army's civilian end strength, 272,700 in FY 95, dropped to 258,600 in FY 96 and was scheduled to decline to 236,000 by FY 01.

Unless directed  by  Congress, the Army was  not permitted to  budget for contingency or crisis response operations. Historically these had been

funded from third and fourth quarter OMA accounts, with the Army antic› affected. In

Reserve, maintained readiness objectives by funding air and ground oper› estimating costs of fuel,  spare parts,  and recurring home station  opera› tions, training, and maintenance based on unit-specific events.

ipating  supplemental  appropriations  at  a  later  date.  If funds  were  not authorized,  Army  training  and  readiness  were  seriously  and  adversely FY  96,  Congress  reprogrammed  $1.65  billion  to  support Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR  and  other contingencies,  but the  Army  still absorbed approximately $611  million in costs. The Army expected to pay between $400 million and $1  billion for contingency operations in FY 97. The OMA budget, $20.2 billion in  FY 96 for the active Army, $2.4 billion  for  the  Army  National  Guard,  and  $1.1  billion  for  the  Army ating tempo  (OPTEMPO)  and  enhancing the quality  of training  at  the combat training centers and installations. OPTEMPO is a framework for

The FY 96 total flying hour program constituted 1,11 0,242 hours  in the President's Budget. FY 96 execution of 1,035,117 hours represented 94.2 percent of the final adjusted program of 1,098,543 hours, reflecting the  impact of overall  FY 96 funding shortfalls and downsizing of force structure. This  compared with FY 95  execution  of 1,152,5 19  hours (90 percent); FY 94 execution of 1,232,640 hours (90.3  percent); and FY 93 execution of 1,37 1,670 hours (97.6 percent). The active Army flying hour program assumed one crew per aircraft and required 14.5 flying hours per crew per month. The cumulative executed flying hours average for FY 96 consisted of 14.3 hours per crew per month, compared to  13.8 in FY 95, 13.5  in FY 94, and 13.3 in FY 93. Neither the Guard nor the Reserve met its  flying hour requirements in FY 96. The Guard required 8.1  hours per crew per month but executed only 5.7; the Reserve required 9.0 but exe› cuted 6.1.  Execution of flying hours for all components was expected to decrease in FY 97, with requirements remaining the same for the active Army  at  14.5,  increasing for  the  Guard to  9.0,  and  decreasing  for  the Reserve to 8.  0.

Ground OPTEMPO requirements were generated using the Battalion Level Training Model for both active and reserve components and were programmed to support training readiness to achieve Cl to C2 readiness level in  the  active  Army  and  C 1  to  C3 in  the  reserve  components. Execution  of ground  OPTEMPO  equaled  107  percent of programmed miles in FY 96, a  16  percent increase from the FY 95 actual OPTEMPO of 91  percent.  The  required  OPTEMPO  of 800  miles  for  the  MlAl Abrams tank fell short, with an actual OPTEMPO of  642 miles in FY 96, though this was a 1 percent increase from FY 95. Required OPTEMPO for the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, 934 miles, was exceeded, with an actu› al OPTEMPO of 1,277 miles, which was a 27 percent increase in execu› tion from FY 95. A 41  percent increase from FY 95 was achieved in exe-

cuting  the 1,309  miles  of  required  OPTEMPO  for  the  M3  Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV), with an actual OPTEMPO of 1,517 miles. In FY 96, the Guard OPTEMPO requirement was 288 miles, but it was funded for an  OPTEMPO of only  178 miles. The Guard accomplished an actual OPTEMPO of 157  miles,  which  represented  88  percent  of the  funded OPTEMPO. This OPTEMPO execution was expected to increase slightly in FY 97. The Reserve's  programmed OPTEMPO of200 miles was almost reached,  with  an  actual  OPTEMPO of 184 miles; this  performance was expected to decline considerably to 76 miles in FY 97.

The OMA budget contained  funds  for  other  categories.  In  FY 96, OSD created the Joint NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical) Defense Program,  which  combined  all  service NBC defense funds  into  a  single program. Smoke and obscurants remained within the Army program, and $27 million was budgeted for them in FY 96. A sum of  $789 million was budgeted for compliance, conservation, prevention, and technology with› in environmental funding.  The  Defense  Environmental  Restoration Account and BRAC received $832 million in the budget. Depot mainte› nance, with a requirement of$1.1 billion, was funded at $915 million, cre› ating an unfunded requirement of$143 million. OMA also budgeted $335 million  for  Army  community  and  soldier  support,  primarily  libraries, recreation centers, sports programs, and gymnasiums ($159 million), and child development services ($11 0 mmion).

In previous years, the Army bad access to $18 billion annually for pro› curement. Budget cuts reduced that amount to $6.9 billion in FY 94, $6.7 billion  in  FY 95,  $7.5  billion  in  FY 96, and an estimated $6.3  billion  in FY  97. Modernization,  not  procurement,  became  the  Army's  key  to preparing  for  the  next  century  and  maintaining  maneuver  battlespace dominance.  The  EXFOR at Fort Hood, Texas,  and  various  warfighting experiments would help the Army determine what capabilities Army XXI and the Army After Next would need for the future.

The FY 96 budget ensured that the multiyear procurement of  UH- 60 Black Hawk helicopters would endure. The Army remained committed to developing  the Comanche  armed  reconnaissance  helicopter  and  the Crusader artillery  weapons  system.  To  replace  the  aging medium  truck fleet, the Army requested funds for the family of  medium tactical vehicles. The total procurement budget for aircraft and  related systems was  $1.5 billion.  Of  the  $446  mi ll ion  programmed for aircraft procurement,  $398 million  (89  percent)  was  designated to  purchase 60 UH- 60s.  Extensive modifications were budgeted for the AH-64 Longbow Apache ($442 mil› lion) and the OH- 58 Kiowa Warrior ($211  million). Close to $1.5 billion was planned for tracked weapons systems, while missile procurement and modifications totaled $839 million. The Army allocated a  total  of $236 million  to purchase  1,102  Hellfire  missiles;  $46  million  for  MLRS

(Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System)  rockets;  $121 million for 120 ATACMS;  $201  million for  1,010 Javelin  missiles;  and  $81  million  for MLRS launchers. Ammunition procurement was budgeted at $1.1  billion.

The FY 96 RDA budget for the Army was $12.2 billion, a cumulative decrease of39 percent since FY 89. Of  the DOD RDA budget, the Army received the smallest portion,  13  percent, while the Air Force received 38 percent,  the  Navy  33  percent,  and  the  defense  agencies 16  percent. Constrained resources ensured that modernization would focus on critical programs,  as  the  cost  of large  investments  was  prohibitive.  The  Army planned to purchase a limited number of new weapons, extend the lives and .improve the capabilities of  selected existing systems, and terminate procurement  and funding for programs  that  offered  only  marginal warfighting or sustainability improvements. Planned upgrades would pro› vide  benefits  only  for  the  near  future,  however,  and  replacement  of weapons systems and equipment could not be accomplished without addi› tional RDA funding.

The Military Construction, Army (MCA), budget for FY 96 focused on  facilities that would  upgrade the capabilities of  Army  installations to serve as power-projection platforms. New facilities would include modem barracks, computerized training simulators, strategic mobility infrastruc› ture, and an overseas pre-positioning site. The total MCA budget of  $625 million incorporated $323 million for troop and community support facil› ities  and  $105  million  for  operations and training facilities. Three child development centers were under construction for a  sum of  $17  million, while  new  training  facilities  were  built at Fort Benning,  Georgia;  Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Drwn, New York;  Fort Eustis, Virginia;  and  Fort Lewis,  Washington.  Of the total  MCA  budget,  $478  million  was  to  be expended  in  CONUS,  $36  million  in  Korea,  $48  million  in  Southwest Asia, and $64 million for planning and design. No MCA funds were des› ignated for Europe. The Army National Guard received $137 million for military construction and the Army Reserve $65 million.

The Army has long recognized that quality of  life for service members and their families has a direct impact on readiness.  Funding constraints, however, have affected the Army's ability to  acquire  and  maintain suffi› cient high-quality housing to meet its needs and to meet annual, recurring requirements  in  maintenance  and  repair.  The  Army  Family  Housing (AFH) portion of  the FY 96 budget integrated funds for construction and revitalization  of housing  as  well  as  the  operation  and  maintenance  of 133,000 Army family housing units worldwide. AFH construction dollars did not, however, increase the housing inventory, as the funds  were used to replace units that were uneconomical to repair. In FY 96, the AFH bud› get of $1.5  billion  was  expended  primarily for maintenance ($640 mil› lion), operations and  utilities ($451  million), and leasing ($221  million),

leaving  onJy  $118  million  for  construction,  improvement,  or  planning. Construction totaling $67.4 million for 488 units was scheduled for Fort Knox,  Kentucky;  the  U.S. Military  Academy,  New  York; Fort  Lee, Virginia; and Fort Lewis, Washington.

The Army's FY 96 Annual Financial Report, based on OMB and DOD requirements and guidelines, gave a clear picture of  the Army's financial position and results of  its operations. The Statement of  Financial Position, similar to a balance sheet in private business, presented the assets, liabili› ties, and net position of the Army on the last day of  the fiscal year. The Army's Statement of  Financial Position for FY 96 showed $201 billion in assets, $25.3 billion in liabilities, and a net position of  $175.7 billion. The net position was composed of unexpended appropriations,  invested capi› tal,  cumulative  results  of operations,  and  future  funding  requirements. This Statement of  Financial Position could be compared to that of  FY 95, when the Army had assets of $221.7  billion,  liabilities of $10.5  billion, and a net position of  $21 1.2 billion.

Military equipment represented half  of  the Army's assets; equipment, real estate, and physical plants comprised more than 62 percent of  assets. Sixteen  percent  of the  Army's assets,  $31.3  billion,  were  in  Treasury accounts,  with  virtually  the  entire  amount  coming  from  appropriated funds. Within the total $37.7 billion of  inventory held by the Army in  FY 96, $35.8 billion (95 percent) was invested in war reserve materiel.

Accounts payable (i.e., what the Army owed for purchases or bills) were generally designated as  such upon receipt of goods and services, regardless  of whether  the  items  were  covered  by  available  budgetary resources.  FY 96 marked the first year that the Army recognized liabil› ities  for  environmental  cleanup,  DOD  restructuring  and  downsizing, radioactive  waste  cleanup,  and  actuarial  liability  for  future  workers' compensation benefits. The Army recorded nearly $8 billion in environ› mental  restoration  as  a  liability  and  $5.3  billion  for  Formerly  Used Defense Sites.  Future  funding  requirements,  an offset  to  net position, included accrued expenses such as annual and military leave and totaled $18.2 billion in FY 96.

The Army, similarly to other federal agencies, relied on appropriations to fund its current activities, so no significant difference between revenues and expenditures was expected. FY 96 revenues totaled $62.3 billion and expenditures $64.7 billion, for a negative balance of$2.4 billion. This was a  worsened  position  from  FY  95,  when revenues  were  $59.8  billion, expenditures $60.8 billion, and the negative balance $1  billion.

Each  year  DOD  submits  to  Congress  an  omnibus  reprogramming action, which incorporates all reprogramming requests submitted by the services. It is  normally developed and submitted to Congress in April or May, with congressional approval generally received late in the fiscal year.

ln FY 96, the omnibus reprogramming was implemented by OSD on 26 August 1996.

As  expected,  the  Army's submission  of requirements  equaled  the sources obtained. The Army's request contained $310.1  million in FY 97 requirements and comparable offsetting sources, as well as $12.3 million in FY 95 requirements and sources. Funds were requested specifically to cover a shortfall  in  the  MPA appropriation and to pay for various  mod› ernization requirements in the  investment appropriation.  Offsets offered by  the Army  consisted  of funds  from  OMA and from  other investment programs, including the cancelled armored gun system program. The con› gressional committees approved practically all of  the Army's  requirements but disapproved the use of the majority of the proposed sources, particu› larly the funds offered from OMA. As a result, funds were available only for a portion of  the MPA shortfall. The investment modernization require› ments remained unfunded. In the final analysis, approved Army increases and decreases totaled $188.4 million.

The  FY 98-03  POM,  submitted  in FY 96,  intended to  provide the right  number of soldiers,  leaders,  civilians,  and systems to  meet  future Army  chaJJenges.  Despite  fiscal  austerity,  the  FY  98-03  POM  tried  to ensure  that  Army  missions  would  be  accomplished  while,  at the  same time, a stable and predictable environment for commanders, soldiers, and civilians would be created and maintained. Due to several initiatives and additional funding distributed to the Army in previous program and  bud› get reviews,  acceptable  levels  of near-term readiness  and sustainability were maintained. The Army adequately funded OPTEMPO.  In addition, upgrades were made to war reserve ammunition stocks, and backlogs  in ammunition demilitarization were addressed.

The  Army's  modernization  program  met  the  Defense  Planning Guidance challenge to increase investments in modernization and recapi› talization. Army RDA was funded at an average of  $13.3  billion per year. The growth from  FY 00  to  FY  03  was made possible due to  additional resources requested by OSD in the 1997 President's Budget, as well  as a new  strategy  that  coupled  management  efficiencies  with  reductions  in acquisition infrastructure. Significant investments in digitization and C4I were  made to  ensure that the Army gained and  maintained  information dominance in the twenty-first century.

The resource plan embedded in the FY 98-03 POM provided the sta› bility  and  predictability  needed  to  control  the  Army's transformation. Commitments to soldiers, the Army's essential asset, were upheld by pre› serving resources through provision for their modernization or upgrade.

In addition, the Army obtained funds to persist in efforts to maintain an acceptable quality oflife for service members, their families, and civil› ians. The Army also planned funding to enable it to pursue Force XXI, the

process of  change that is  the Army's comprehensive approach to its tran› sition into the twenty-first century.

Under the FY 98-03 POM, the Army was redesigning non-warfight› ing units and organizations to create further efficiencies while realigning warfighting elements of the Army to meet the needs of Force XXI.  By integrating  more  efficient business practices  at  all  levels  and  adopting technological improvements, the Army sought to reduce the cost of  doing business. A thorough review of  requirements for housing, other facilities, real property maintenance, training resources, and many other areas yield› ed more than $6 billion in savings during the FY 98-03 POM. The Army applied these  funds  to  more pressing needs and shortages in readiness, modernization, quality of  life, and force structure.

In 1995,  the Army  Budget Office  initiated efforts to  reengineer the programming  and  budgeting  phases  of the  PPBES.  The  initiative  was taken  because PPBES had  become more difficult to accomplish. A sus› tained decrease in the Army's  resources, the reduction of  Army personnel, an increased demand for  performance and accountability, and delays by OSD had all contributed to making the process unwieldy. New initiatives that were  affecting  the  process  included  the  GPRA  results-oriented process; the Quadrennial Defense Review, which established the direction for future budgeting; and the National Defense Panel, whose mission is to submit  recommendations  to  Congress  concerning  DOD  efforts  on improving the PPBES. The National Defense Panel will also conduct an independent assessment of  possible military force structures through 2010 and  beyond,  providing  it  to  Congress  with  DOD  comments  by 15 December 1997.

## Personnel

Following the personnel  drawdown  that  began  in  FY  89,  the Total Army at the end of  FY 96 was the smallest of  any since World War II. The U.S. Army dropped to being the eighth largest in the world. Active Army strength  decreased  by  about  17,000  personnel  in  FY  96,  from  approxi› mately 508,500 at the beginning of  the year to approximately 491 ,000 by the end of  the year. Planned personnel reductions were achieved by reduc› ing  accessions  as  well  as  using  several  separation  programs  such  as Voluntary Early Transition, Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI), Special Separation Benefits(SSB), and Early Retirement. The end strength, how› ever,  was  short of the BUR goal  of 495,000  personnel  because attrition during  the  year  was  higher  than  expected.  The  Guard  declined  from 374,900 soldiers in FY 95 to 370,000 in FY 96 and was close to reaching its expected  drawdown  strength  of  367,000  in  FY  97.  The  Reserve strength, which was 241,300 troops in FY 95, decreased to 226,200 in FY 96 and  was  scheduled to  stabilize  at 208,000  in FY 98.  Army  civilians numbered 272,700 in FY 95;  their numbers were reduced to  258,600 in FY 96 and were scheduled to decline further, to 236,000, by FY 01.

Minorities  comprised  38.6  percent  of  the  active  force. African American representation was the highest of all  minorities  at 27  percent. Hispanics  contributed 5.5 percent  of the  force  and  other  minorities accounted for 6.1 percent. Minority  representation remained  higher among the enlisted force than in the officer corps. Of  the 42.4 percent of enlisted personnel who  were  minorities,  30.1 percent  were  African American, 6 percent Hispanic, and 6.4 percent of other ethnicity. Of  the 19.4 percent of officers who were minorities,  11.5  percent were African American,  3.3  percent  Hispanic,  and  4.5  percent  from  other  minority groups.  Women represented  13.4 percent of  the force13  percent of the officers and  13.5 percent of  the enlisted force.

Sixty-six percent oftheArmy's  soldiers were married. With a military force  consisting primarily of married soldiers, readiness relied upon the ability of  families to manage in the service member's absence. The Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) offered symposia to families and senior Army

leaders, addressing quality of life issues and  improving services to  sol› diers and their families.

The Army's  retention rates for FYs 94, 95, and 96 remained consistent and  at  normal  levels  for  mid-career soldiers  as  well  as  career soldiers (those nearing or past retirement eligibility). Retention rates for soldiers serving their initial  term  of  enlistment were  about  I  0  percent above nor› mal levels.  Enhanced advertising, reduced influence of the drawdown on younger soldiers,  and  concerned  command  involvement had  a  positive effect  on  retention  rates  for  first-term  soldiers  in  FY  95  and  FY  96. Overall,  the  Army  achieved  99.9  percent  of its  FY  96  retention  goals. Nevertheless,  PERSCOM reviewed  its retention programs in  an  effort to increase its end strength in FY 97. FY 96 retention rates, which were near› ly  equivalent to  those of FY 94 and  FY 95, are shown in Table 2, delin› eated by rank, gender, and etlmic representation.

The Army continually  worked  to  reduce the  number of nondeploy› able  soldiersthose  who  were unable  to  deploy  to  a  specified  area of operation. Permanent nondeployable soldiers constituted less than  I per› cent of the  force,  an improvement from  FY 95, while temporary nonde› ployable  soldiers  comprised  nearly  5  percent  of  operating  strength, remaining  a  serious  concern  to  Army  leaders.  The  Army  planned  to improve the evaluation process for determining the nondeployable status of  soldiers in  FY 97.

An  individual  soldier  can  be  nondeployable  for  multiple  reasons simultaneously. The Army assigned priorities to  categories of nondeploy› ability  and,  by  listing  a  soldier only  in  the  highest-priority  category  to which he or she belonged, avoided counting that soldier as nondeployable more than once. When a permanent medical limitation (HIY-positive, can› cer, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, or other progressive medical condi› tion) was diagnosed, the service member was given an assignment limita› tion  and  was  not  assigned  to  deploying  units.  If a  member  already assigned to a deploying unit became restricted permanently, reassignment and  replacement  occurred.  Non-unit  personnel  (transients,  trainees/stu-

## PERSONNEL

dents,  long-term  patients,  prisoners,  and  personnel  awaiting  separation) were not categorized as nondeployable. Table 3 depicts the numbers and categories of  nondeployable Army personnel for FY 96.

The active Army  recruiting mission increased as the drawdown pro› ceeded. During the years of personnel reductions, the number of  recruits

acquired had been far less than the number of soldiers leaving the Army. Once the  Army  reached  its  end  strength  goal,  an  increased  number of recruits were needed to offset normal attrition so that the number of per› sonnel required  by the  BUR could  be maintained. The Army's accession objective in  FY 95 was 63,000 personnel. This increased to 73,000 in FY 96 and was scheduled to rise further to 90,000 in FY 97. The Army added 350 noncommissioned officers to the active recruiting force from FY 94 to  FY 96  to  meet the  new  challenge.  Increased  advertising assisted  the Army  in  meeting  its  recruiting  goal.  The latest Youth  Attitude Tracking Study,  conducted  by  DOD,  showed  an  increased  awareness  of Army opportunities among the  nation's youth.  About I 0  percent of those sur› veyed indicated  they  would  probably join the  military,  with  educational funding listed as their primary motivation.

One of the Army's recruiting objectives was  to  provide high-quality non- prior service (NPS) accessions. To  achieve this objective, the Army established annual goals for the percentage of  NPS accessions that were high school diploma graduates. Table 5 shows that, while the active Army and the Army Reserve met their goals in FY 96, the Army National Guard again  fell  far short. Although  the Guard did not meet its objective for the percentage of soldiers who  held  high school diplomas, all of its soldiers who did not have a diploma held its equivalent.

The Army also established annual goals to limit the number of indi› viduals entering the service who scored in the  lowest category (Category IV) of the Armed  Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). All elements of the Total Army achieved or exceeded their goal of  2 percent or less of  acces› sions belonging to AFQT IV, as shown in Table 6.

In  FY 96,  the Army began studying how to  improve the professional development of the enlisted  force  to  reflect the post- Cold War environ› ment. A review of  EPMS XXI was scheduled to occur in FY 97. The pri› mary objective  of EPMS  XXI  will  be  to  ensure  the  development  and maintenance of  appropriate career paths to produce properly trained sol› diers for Army missions.

On a monthly basis, DA determines the number of  soldiers to be pro› moted, by Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) and grade, from board promotion lists for the senior enlisted ranks of  sergeant, first class, mas› ter sergeant, and sergeant major. DA also selects soldiers for promotion to the ranks of  sergeant and staff  sergeant and publishes the minimum board scores.  Tn  FY  96, 45,235  enlisted  soldiers,  or  10.7  percent of the  total enlisted  strength,  were  selected  for promotion to  or within  the noncom› missioned  officer  corps.  This  total consisted  of 535  promotions  to sergeant major,  3,350  to  master  sergeant,  8,550 to  sergeant,  first class, 10,878 to staff  sergeant, and 2 1,922 to sergeant.

The Army achieved 99.9 percent of its reenlistment goal, with 72,990 soldiers reenlisting. Of  the initial-term soldiers,  100.2 percent of  the reen› listment  goal  was  accomplished,  with  2 1,484  first-termers  reenlisting. Approximately 82 percent of  these soldiers had higher than average scores on the general test administered by  the Army prior to enlistment,  which was a  positive indication  for  the  future  of the  noncommissioned officer corps. A total of  23,174 mid-career soldiers reenlisted, representing 102.2 percent of  the Army's  goal, while 28,332 career soldiers reenlisted at a rate equal to 97.8 percent of  the goal.

One program the Army used to improve retention and to maintain readi› ness  in  certain  specialties  was  the  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  (SRB) Program, in which incentives were paid to soldiers with designated MOSs. ln FY 96, due to mHitary pay and allowance reductions, the SRB Program budget  was  decreased  from  $22.8  million  to  $17.5  million,  causing  a decrease in retention in some specialties.

Enlisted reassignment no-shows persisted in detracting significantly from  personnel  readiness.  Although gaining units expected  soldiers  to arrive in response  to published  orders,  personnel were  sometimes deferred or removed from the assignment. The Army made a concerted effort in  FY  96  to  reduce no- shows,  which  would  improve efficiency, enhance  morale,  and  ease  budgeting.  ODCSPER approved  an  action plan,  which was  implemented in March 1996, to  focus efforts at PER› SCOM and in  the field to  decrease no-shows. The description of a no› show was expanded to include deletions (soldiers who were deleted from assignment within  ninety  days  of,  during,  or  after  the  report  month), non-movers (soldiers who failed to depart the losing command as sched› uled), and late arrivals (soldiers who failed to report to the gaining com› mand as scheduled). This new definition better fit the gaining comman› der's view  of a  no-show  and  improved  personnel  readiness  reporting. Under the plan,  reassignment procedures at the installation level  were tightened and, in May  1996, management reports tracking no-shows by name were created.

Although there was no VSI program for enlisted soldiers in place in FY 96, a small Early Retirement program for them did exist. A total of750 enlisted soldiers were  approved  for  early  retirement  in  three categories, with basic active service date and grade established as the parameters. No early retirement categories were based on a soldier's MOS.

The Army experiences  personnel shortages and  excesses  when  sol› diers lose skill qualifications  or  organizations  experience  structural changes.  To  relieve  this  personnel  imbalance,  some  soldiers  must  be reclassified in another MOS. Nevertheless, many reclassification requests are disapproved because the soldier is not qualified to serve in the MOS, the Army cannot provide training for the new MOS, the Army does not need additional soldiers in  the MOS, or the request is incomplete. Of the 6,306 reclassification  requests in FY 96, only 61  percent were approved. ODCSPER planned to enhance RETAIN, the system used for reclassifi› cation processing, in FY 97.

## Officer Personnel

Officer end strength for FY 96 was 80,628, against a target of  81,295, which  produced  a shortage of 667 officers.  Commissioned officers fin› ished the year at a level of  68,662, short of  the goal of  69,645 by 983 offi› cers. The bulk of the officer shortages were in the ranks of  captain and major. Although this did not affect readiness, the shortages were apparent to field commanders.  Successful drawdown programs and an increase in voluntary separations by company grade officers contributed to the short› ages. Warrant officers numbered  11 ,966, higher than the target of 11 ,650

by 316 officers. The distribution of officers serving on active duty  in  FY 96  is shown in Table 7.

The  U.S.  Military Academy  processed 4,722  congressional nomina› tions for the class of2000. Of  the  1,651 offers of  appointment made,  I  ,192 were  accepted,  and  these  new  cadets  entered  West  Point  in  June  1996. Eleven  applicants  graduating  from  service  academies  other  than  West

Point applied for cross-commissioning in the Army.  Of these,  l 0 acces› sions were approved5 from the Air Force Academy, 3 from  the Naval Academy,  and  2  from  the  Merchant  Marine  Academy.  In  interservicc transfers, the Army considered applications from eight officers to transfer into the Army from  other services, approving those  from  three  individu› als. The Army also considered twenty-three applications to transfer from the Army to other services and approved fifteen of  them.

Due to budgetary constraints, the Army did not convene any selection boards for Call to Active Duty Programs. Applicants with unique skills or with critically  short MOSs were considered individually as exceptions to policy.  Forty-three officers were considered and twenty-five approved to return to active duty for such purposes as serving on the Retiree Council or the Physical Disability Evaluation Board.

ODCSPER approved several major changes to improve the quality of the officer corps. A branching model was developed to distribute officers better,  based  on  quality,  race,  ethnic group, gender,  and academic disci› pline, as well as to improve chances for West Point cadets to receive one of  their top three branch choices. A new functional area designation model was designed to  improve ODCSPER's ability to satisfy officers' requests when designating functional areas while still meeting the Army's  needs. In a new  approach,  ODCSPER  divided  officer  authorizations  between branch-qualified and non-branch-qualified captains, enabling ODCSPER to fill  the Officer Distribution Plan from the officer inventory in a more efficient  manner.  In  addition,  ODCSPER  developed  and  implemented new slating models for Command and General Staff College (CGSC) and senior service colleges.

The end strength of  the Dental Corps decreased to 1,158 at the end of FY 96 from  1,282 in FY  95, a  reduction of 124 officers. The disparity between  civilian  salaries  and  active  duty  dental  pay  contributed  to  the struggle to  recruit and retain dental officers that had persisted for several years. Unable to meet its recruiting goal, the Army developed several pro› grams  in  FY 96  to  increase  accessions  into  the  Dental  Corps.  One  of these, created with the assistance of  the Office of  the Surgeon General and the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, sent active duty dental officers on recruiting missions, authorized Health Prof essions Scholarships for den› tal  students,  and  authorized  a  $30,000  accession  bonus  for  new  dental officers.  In  addition,  a  long-term  health  education  board selected  forty officers to attend residency training.

Programs  to  reduce  the  number of officers on active duty  included VSIISSB and Early Retirement. The goal ofVSIISSB in FY 96 was to pro› vide  significant  incentives  for  captains  to  leave  active  duty  voluntarily. Early retirement was offered to officers who had served at least fifteen but no more than twenty years in the Army. Majors who had been passed over

once for lieutenant colonel were highly encouraged to take advantage of early retirement.

Implementation of the  Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act (DOPMA)  remained  a  constant process  throughout  FY  96. The Army complied with the goals for selection rate and length of  time for promo› tion  in  the  basic  branches,  except  for  the  selection  rate  to  lieutenant colonel  and  the  length  of time  for  promotion  to  major. The  year  group being  considered  for  lieutenant  colonel  had  not  been  subjected  to  the Selective  Early Retirement Board process, thereby creating  a surplus of majors. The future need for lieutenant colonels was smaller than in previ› ous years and was reflected in the selection rate. Though the Army had not met the goal for length of  time for promotion to major for several years, the  length  of time decreased two months in FY 96 and was projected to decline  further. Table  9 illustrates  the  actual  selection  rates  against  the DOPMA goal and the length of  time in service for promotion versus the DOPMAgoal.

Section 931  of  the FY 94 National Defense Authorization Act, which required each service to develop and implement personnel plans to permit the  orderly  promotion  of officers  to  brigadier  general  or rear  admiral (lower half), was fully implemented by DOD in 1995. The Army and other services  revised  career  development  paths  to  accommodate  early joint assignments. In addition, they assigned more colonels/captains, lieutenant colonels/commanders, and senior service college graduates to joint duty; educated  officers  on  joint education  opportunities;  and  toughened  the standards for Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation.

The Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986 stated that completing a joint duty assignment (IDA) was essential for an officer to be able to perform effectively as a general officer and was one element of becoming joint qualified. In FY 96, promotion boards selected forty-five Army officers to the rank of brigadier general.  Of  these, 40 percent were joint qualified, while 9 percent had joint equivalency waivers. In compar› ison, 76 percent of  Air Force, 63 percent of  Marine Corps, and 32 percent of  Navy selectees were joint qualified.

In FY 96, the Army designated the largest number of  JSOs of  any ser› vice-346 ofDOD's  total515. The Army also named 797 officers as JSO nominees, one-third of the total  2,356 JSO nominees throughout DOD. Of the  Army  JSO  nominees,  405  were  so  designated  because  of their Critical Occupational Specialties (COS) in infantry, armor, artillery, air defense artillery, aviation, special operations, or combat engineers. In FY 96, of all Army officers with a COS, 1,566 officers had completed Joint Professional Military Education (JPME); 1,109 were designated as JSOs; 2,144 had  been named JSO  nominees;  1,495  were JSO nominees  who had  not completed JPME;  1, 149 were JSO nominees serving in a JDA; and 8 were JSO nominees who had completed a JDA and were cw-rently attending JPME.

Of the JSOs with COSs,  163 of the field grade officers had already served in a second joint assignment, 46 of which were  in a critical joint position, and 155 were currently serving in a second joint assignment, 74 of which  were  in  a  critical  joint position.  Of the  general officers  with COSs,  14  had already served in a  second joint assignment,  7  of which were in a critical joint position, and 12 were currently serving in a second joint assignment, 9 of  which were in a critical joint position.

The first assignment for Army officers in FY 96 after being designat› ed a JSO were as follows:  116 to command positions,  13  to HQDA, 2 to critical Joint  Staff positions, 6 to other Joint Staff positions,  15  to  other critical JDA positions, 84 to other JDA positions, 15 to PME (profession› al  military education) positions, 32 to  other operations, and 60 to  other staffs. JDA tours for general officers ranged from 20.8 to 25.5 months and averaged 24.4 months. Field grade officers remained in their tours for 32.9 to 37 months, with an average of36.5 months. A total of  516 officers were unable  to  fulfill  the  normal  JDA  tour  length  of 36  months  because  of retirement, COS reassignment, or a new JDA assignment overseas. At the end ofFY 96, the Army had 3,249 officers serving in JDA positions, 34.8 percent of  all the DOD JDA positions.

Of the  1,84  7 waivers awarded to field grade officers, a total of 1  ,070 were for departing a JDA position before the minimum tour length of 36 months had been served; 45 of  the waivers were for JSO designation. Of the  167  waivers  given  to  general  officers,  45  were  for departing  a JDA early, 36 were for attending CAPSTONE (the Battle Command Training Program for  senior commanders  at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas),  and  45 were  for  promotion  to  brigadier general.  A  total  of 282  Army  officers graduated from JPME Phase U (Armed Forces Staff  College) in FY 96. Of those,  15  percent had not completed the resident PME Phase I, while  14 percent had completed a nonresident PME Phase I.

Promotion rates for joint officers in FY 96 were much higher than the board average for the Army competitive category. Table  10 indicates pro-

motion percentages by rank, as compared with the board average, for various types of  joint assignments. ·

FY  96  was  the  sixth  year  of  implementation  of  the  Defense Acquisition Workforc. e Improvement Act (DAWIA), as DOD aggressively managed the acquisition workforce. The Army used Process Action Teams (PAT) and an Acquisition Corps Reengineering Team to initiate new pro› grams,  concepts,  and  policies.  Section  906d  of the  National  Defense Authorization Act ofFY 96 reqUired a DOD reduction of 15,000 acquisi› tion personnel. An additional reduction of 15,000 personnel was planned to occur in FY 97 as part of the DOD requirement to reduce acquisition personnel by 25 percent from FY 96 to FY 00.

The  DAWIA  permitted  only  Acquisition  Corps  members  to  hold Critical Acquisition Positions (CAP).  In  FY  96, DOD implemented the Best Qualified Program for seni9r acquisition positions such as Program Executive  Officers,  Acquisition  Category  (ACAT)  I  and  II  Program Managers (PM), and Deputy PMs, fulfilling the DAWIA objective to fos› ter career opportunities for both military and civilian personnel. In FY 96, the  Army selected two ACAT I PMs, using the Best Qualified civilian/mil› itary competition.  During FY 96,  the Army held  its  second centralized civilian selection board for PMs in the civil service pay grades of  GS- 14 and GS- 15, selecting thirteen, more than twice as many as selected dur› ing the first board in FY 95.

In FY  96,  the  Army  developed  a  Civilian  Acquisition  Leader Development model supported by an automated Individual Development Plan, revitalized the civilian component of  the  Acquisition Corps, and initi› ated a Central Career Management Program. The high caliber of  acquisition personnel was demonstrated by the fact that no individuals needed certifi› cation in lieu of  a baccalaureate degree by an Acquisition Career Program Board in FY 96. The Army trained more than 20,000 government  and indus› try personnel in FY 96 with its traveling road show that promoted process improvement.  Additionally,  the  Army  initiated  an  Acquisition  Corps Reserve PAT to recommend improvements in the reserve components.

A total of  2,314 Army personnel participated in acquisition education in FY 96. The largest group, 2,027 individuals, was involved in the DOD Thition  Reimbursement  Program. Under  the  Defense  Acquisition Scholarship Program in  FY 96, thirteen scholarship students were select› ed,  five of  them Army personnel. Pursuing full-time graduate degrees in business,  physical  science,  engineering,  technology  management,  and public  administration,  these  individuals  were  scheduled  to  join Army acquisition upon graduation. An additional 282 persons served as interns in the acquisition workforce.

Within the Army in FY 96, a total  of 4,986 CAPs were occupied by GS- 14, GS- 15,  and  Senior  Executive Service  civilians,  lieutenant colonels, colonels, and general officers.  Of these CAPs, civilians  filled 4,268 positions and military service members filled 7 18. The majority of the CAPs, in systems planning, research, and development, was filled by 2,316  civilians.  The  largest  concentration of military service members, 450, was  in acquisition management. Acquisition Corps members in FY 96 numbered 4,755, with the highest concentration found in systems plan› ning,  research,  development,  and  engineering,  and  the  next  greatest grouping in program management.

Army Acquisition PMs met the goal of  serving four years in their posi› tions in FY 96.  Of the  PMs who  were reassigned  in  FY 96, all  ten  had served their full term; their average length of  assignment was 50.5 months. The Army granted eighty-seven waivers or exceptions to acquisition work› force personnel in FY 96. Forty-one waivers, the majority, were issued for humanitarian reassignments or discharges; twenty-seven were for reassign› ment in the government's  interest; and the remainder was for other reasons.

The promotion rate for officers in the Acquisition Corps was consis› tently higher than in the Army competitive category, except to the rank of lieutenant colonel, as shown in Table  II.

## Special Topics

Secretary West assembled a task force to study soldier participation in extremist activities in the Army after the bombing of  the federal  building

in  Oklahoma City and  the murder of two civilians  in  North Carolina by Fort Bragg soldiers. On 2 1 March  1996, the task force released its report, entitled  "Defending American Values."  The  task  force  found  no  wide› spread or organized extremist activity in  the Army, although it did identi› fy individuals  and  small informal  groups  that  held extremist  views. Neither allegations of widespread, concerted recruitment of  soldiers for extremist  causes  nor  organized  participation  by  soldiers  in  extremist groups was substantiated. The task force concluded that the Army impart› ed traditional American values to  its soldiers and fostered an environment in which respect for others was expected. The report further stated that the Am1y needed to remain vigilant to recognize subtle forms of  racism and to  reaffi rm the importance of  diversity and human decency. Since caring for soldiers and their families received renewed emphasis in the "back-to› basics"  program,  the  report  noted  that  the  Army  needed  continually  to support American values of tolerance and  nondiscrimination, as  well  as take action when transgressions occurred.

In conjunction with promoting American values, ODCSPER prepared a  leader's guide on  violence prevention  in  1996.  Combining issues cov› ered by diverse programs into a single document and a focused program, the leader's guide listed a comprehensive review of steps useful  in  limit› ing  risk  factors in  all areas  injurious  to  soldiers  and  their  families. Preventing domestic violence, avoiding injuries, and developing a healthy lifestyle  were  some of the  topics  covered.  The  number  of substantiated domestic abuse cases declined in FY 96 to 9,562 from  10,026 in FY 95, continuing the decline of the previous two years.

To further ensure a healthy Army, the U.S. Army Center for Substance Abuse Programs (ACSAP) developed a  three-day course on Installation Prevention Team Training (lPTI) for personnel with the authority to com› mit installation resources  for  the  prevention  of  substance  abuse. Participants  developed collaborative  risk reduction processes, developed an integrated Installation Prevention Plan for their home installation, and learned to apply the Army's Risk Reduction Model.  Upon completion of the  course,  teams  briefed  their  installation  commanders  on  their  newly developed  plans,  with ACSAP providing assistance  for implementation. Funding  for  the  program,  including  travel  and TOY  costs,  was  paid  by HQDA.

lo FY 96, ACSAP conducted 14 IPIT courses, training teams from 43 active  duty  installations,  representing  70  percent  of Army  installations. More than  four  hundred  military  and  civilian  personnel,  at  all military ranks  through  colonel and civilian  grades  through  GS- 14,  were trained. The cross-discipline installation teams integrated personnel from Alcohol and  Drug,  Safety,  Equal  Employment  Opportunity, Provost  Marshal, Army  Community  Service,  Civilian  Personnel  Office,  Chaplaincy,

Preventive Medicine, Social Work Services, Family Advocacy, and Office of  the Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) organizations.

The  Army  drug  testing  program  remained  a  valuable  program  for commanders and supervisors in deterring illegal drug use, identifying ille› gal drug abusers, and providing a legally defensible basis for administra› tive and Uniform Code of Military Justice actions to remove drug abusers from the Army. In FY 96, the rate of  specimens testing positive for illegal drugs was 0.99 percent, with  11,443 positive specimens out of 1,161,527 specimens tested. The active Army had the lowest positive specimen rate at 0.61  percent, or 5,897 specimens testing positive out of 964,280 speci› mens tested.  Exhibiting the highest illegal  drug usage rate, 2.93  percent, the  Guard  tested  positive  in  4,141  specimens  out  of 141,393.  Not  far behind the Guard, however, were the Reserve and the Army civilian work› force.  Reserve soldiers tested 2.52 percent positive in 1,195 specimens out of47,495, while civilians demonstrated a 2.51  percent positive rate in 210 specimens out of 8,359 tested.

On  12  April 1996,  the  Food  and  Nutrition  Board, Institute  of Medicine, U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, began a  review of military women's nutrition as part of the Defense Women's Health  Research Program. The study planned  to use available research to recommend changes for women in military regulations and standards to  replace the rules that had been based on research conducted primari› ly  on  men. The study's objectives were to ensure military readiness by reviewing  the  consistency,  adequacy,  and  currency  of scientifically based nutrition standards for military women. In addition, it would con› sider body fat standards, energy requirements for rations, nutrition rec› ommendations for women in garrison, and strategies to counter iron and folate deficiencies that impaired readiness. Nutrition education, weight loss/maintenance guidelines for  women across the reproductive  lifecy› cle,  and  calcium  intake and fitness  habits  with  consequences  to  bone health  would  be addressed. The study  would  also assess the  impact of current regulations, standards, and policies on the military readiness of servicewomen and suggest ways to  improve military readiness through new nutrition  initiatives, adjustment of  medical standards, and  identifi› cation of inconsistent or conflicting regulations. Finally, the study would suggest  universal standards  and  policies  to satisfy service-specific requirements (such as a single DOD standard for female body fat and a single method of  assessment).

The study found that, although 10 to 20 percent of  women had a defi› cient iron intake, they had to restrict their dietary intake to meet military body  fat  standards.  At  the  same  time,  they  were  issued  3,600  calories when  in  the  fielda  high  caloric intake designed  to  meet  male energy requirements. Body composition standards were founded on the belief  that

a large waist girth in men indicated lack of  exercise, overeating, poor mil› itary  appearance,  and  long-term  health  risks.  No simple parallel  site of female fat deposits producing the same side effects has been found to exist for women;  hence, each military service uses a different female body fat equation.  Servicewomen  were  actually  placed  at  greater risk  for  stress fractures  and,  in  later  life,  osteoporosis,  because of the  requirement  to maintain excessively low  body weight through dietary restriction. Of  the I  0 percent  of servicewomen  who  were  pregnant,  some  were  probably restricting their weight gain  to  an  excessive degree,  compromising their health and possibly accounting for the lower birth weight of their infants.

The FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act revamped DOD pro› cedures in determining the status of  missing service members, DOD civil› ians, and DOD contractors. DOD was required to form an office of  miss› ing personnel, while theater commanders were obliged to review all miss› ing person recommendations from field commanders. Legal counsel was to  be  assigned to represent each missing person and, in conjunction with the  DOD  missing personnel  office,  would  review  any  new  information that might change the missing person's status. Each military service was expected to appoint an  initial review board at the time of loss and a sub› sequent review board a year later for each missing person. Review boards would be conducted every three  years for  thirty  years,  and  the  primary next of  kin would be given a government allowance as long as the service member remained missing.

The  Defense  Prisoner  of War/Missing  Personnel  Office  (DPMO) completed a comprehensive review of  all losses to determine if  any known information, documents, or investigations could produce additional  leads on prisoners of war (POWs) or missing persons.  DPMO forwarded  the review  to  each  primary  next  of kin  on  1 December  1995.  DPMO  also assumed  responsibility  for  all  U.S. goverrunent  persotmel  worldwide placed in DUSTWUN  (Duty  Status  Whereabouts  Unknown)  status. DPMO's activities consisted  of coordinating with the  individual's home station, conducting an informal investigation of  the absence and the search or recovery operations, and retaining the person in DUSTWUN status for a maximum of  ten days. During FY 96, there were no individuals report› ed  in a DUSTWUN status.

As of  30 September  1996, there were 662 Army soldiers unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. DPMO began using a process called 3rd Criterion, in anticipation of  its approval as policy, to account for soldiers whose bod› ies were lost at sea or destroyed in aircraft crashes, explosions, or similar incidents. At the end of  FY 96, the Army had 152 soldiers unaccounted for who seemed to fit this category. DPMO pursued confirmation of  the fate of  all  DOD  individuals on the Vietnam priority discrepancy case list who were unaccounted for.  A January  1996 policy review confirmed the fate

of  5 individuals, reducing the list to 50 for whom confirmation was being pursued, of whom 31  were Army soldiers.

In  January  1995,  DPMO  began  holding  meetings  throughout  the United States with the families ofPOWs and missing persons in locations convenient to the greatest number offamilies. Government representatives updated families monthly on policy issues and current events, and fami› lies  were  able  to  express  their concerns  and  ask questions.  The Army, which usually sent one individual as the Army liaison to DPMO for each meeting, responded directly to family members on all issues raised during the meetings. In  1996, fifty-two family members of  Army soldiers attend› ed  the DPMO meetings.  General Dennis J.  Reimer,  CSA, was the guest speaker at the  twenty-seventh annual meeting of the National League of Families in June 1996, at which family members were able to review their family member's file. The government paid for the travel of  family mem› bers to attend the briefings held in conjunction with the league meeting.

An Army  soldier  listed  as  unaccounted  for  from  the  time  of the Vietnam  War  was  discovered  to  be  living in Georgia.  Master  Sergeant Mateo Sabog had served twenty-four years on active duty  before he dis› appeared. On 1 March 1996, he was returned to active duty and assigned to  Fort Gordon, Georgia. The general court-martial convening authority, Fort Gordon's commanding general, gave Sabog a letter of  reprimand for lost time and retired him from active duty on  l May  1996.

The Army Retiree Council, designed to communicate issues of inter› est for the retired community to the CSA and other Army leaders, held its thirty-sixth annual meeting in the Pentagon in April 1996. Of  the sixty-one issues  submitted  by  Army  installation retiree  councils, 60  percent  were concerned with the future of  military health care. The Council authored a joint  position paper strongly supporting the restoration of  promised health care and  recommending  that TRICARE Prime  be opened  to  all  retiree beneficiaries.  The  Council,  pleased  with  annual  legislative  efforts  that ensured  COLA (Cost  of Living  Allowance)  equity  from  1994  through 1998, urged  the Army  to maintain COLA equity beyond  1998 to  remain fair and equitable to retirees, and to aid in recruiting and retaining a high› quality  force. The Council further recommended strongly that DOD pre› serve the commissary benefit as an integral part of the military's earned compensation system, particularly since military pay raises had tradition› ally been computed using the commissary benefit as a fundamental por› tion of  the compensation calculation. As the Army retiree population grew, exceeding the active duty population in FY 96, the Council urged senior Army  leaders  to  remain  advocates  for  retirees and to  counter a  possible trend by local commanders to reduce retiree services.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint  for the Future

Force XXI, the Army's  vision for transitioning from an industrial-age, threat-based,  Cold  War Army  to  an  information-age,  capabilities-based Army  in  preparation  for  the  twenty-first  century,  made  considerable progress toward redesigning the Army's operational forces during its third year of planning and  experimentation. The comprehensive  approach of Force XXI aims to produce Army XXI, a twenty-first century Army orga› nized, equipped, and staffed to maximize the potential of  the information age.  Focusing  on soldiers, doctrine,  organization, training,  leader devel› opment, equipment,  weapons,  and sustainment,  Force XXI will  provide the  nation  with  a  ground  force  capability to conduct simultaneous  and seamless operations across the spectrum of conflict. With a view toward future  increased joint operations,  Force  XXI  is  creating  modular  force packages, integrating information technologies, improving real-time bat› tlefield information, and increasing electronic connectivity between units. Force XXI force design strives for more lethality, mobility, flexibility, sur› vivability, and responsiveness. As a result, planners are considering using more infantry, more lethal artillery, brigade-based combat service support, and brigade reconnaissance. In the future, information technology and the lessons gleaned  from Army XXI are expected to produce an even more agile, lethal, and versatile force, called Army After Next.

ln spring  1995, the Army began reviewing its division design to create a new Force XXJ division. It will operate jointly as part of  a corps and will need  heavy and light forces  to  respond to any mission. A heavy division was designed  first;  light and  special  divisions will  have  the capability to receive  new  technology.  TRADOC  accepted 7 possible  designs in April 1995, narrowed the field to 3 in  September 1995 following an affordabili› ty  study,  and  selected I in  January  1996 for field experimentation. With 15,800 soldiers, the experimental division is smaller than the 18,500-troop divisions designed to implement AirLand Battle doctrine in the 1980s, but

similar in size to all earlier divisions of  the twentieth century. This experi› mental force contains three maneuver brigades and an air cavalry brigade and is capable of  tailoring modular force packages for different missions.

## Force Development

The  1993  BUR forced  the Army to  improve the  effectiveness of its early-arriving forces,  enhance strategic mobility,  and  improve  the  readi› ness  of its  reserve  components. The Army  is  capable  of dispatching  a CONUS-based contingency force of  up to seven divisions and  its support elements anywhere in the world.  Light forcesairborne, air assault, and light  infantryprovide  versatile,  strategic  force  projection  and  forcible entry capability and are able to operate in restricted terrain such as moun› tains, jungles, and urban areas. Heavy armored and mechanized forces› equipped  with Abrams  tanks,  Bradley  fighting  vehicles,  Apache  attack helicopters,  and Paladin field artillery systems-provide mobile warfare capability.  Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)  offer  unique  capabilities, such as reestablishing stability and civil infrastructures.

In FY 96, the number of  active Army divisions declined from  12 to  I  0, while the number of Guard divisions remained at 8, stabilizing the Total Army division strength at 18 for the foreseeable future. Active Army sep› arate brigades remained at 3 while the reserve separate brigades decreased from 24 to 22.  Reserve separate brigades were expected to decline to  18 in FY 97. The active Army retained its 5 Special Forces groups and  the Reserve its 2 Special Forces groups; the Army Ranger Regiment remained in the force.

The  BUR  recommended  that  fifteen  enhanced  readiness  brigades capable of  deploying ninety days after mobilization replace Guard round› out brigades. These enhanced  readiness  brigades?  infantry,  5  mecha› nized  infantry,  2  armor,  and  I  armored cavalry  regimentare  now  the nation's principal reserve ground combat maneuver force.  Readiness ini› tiatives  focused  on  these  enhanced  readiness  brigades,  as  well  as  other Guard and Reserve combat support and combat service support units that would deploy early in a crisis.  In FY 96, twelve  of the  fifteen enhanced readiness  brigades completed demanding training conducted by recently organized  Regional  Training  Brigades.  Two  of the  enhanced  readiness brigadesthe 48th from  Georgia and the 39th from Arkansascomplet› ed successful rotations at the National Training Center (NTC) and at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), respectively.

The Total Army in FY 96 was composed of  a contingency force of  two active  corps and  four active  divisions. The remaining  forward-deployed force in  Germany consisted of one active corps and two active divisions (one  armored,  one  mechanized  infantry).  In  the  Pacific,  the  forward-

deployed force contained one  light infantry  division  in  Hawaii and  one infantry  division  in  Korea.  Eight  Guard  divisions  made  up  the  Total Army's  strategic  reserve,  with  the  fifteen  Guard  enhanced  readiness brigades providing the reinforcing force. In addition, the Army possessed a  rapid  regional  response capability  of one active  corps and  two  active divisions.  With  an  emphasis  on  power  projection,  the  majority  of the active Army's land combat units-one airborne division, one air assault division,  one armored  division,  two  mechanized  infantry  divisions,  one light infantry division, and one armored cavalry regimentwere stationed in CONUS. One infantry brigade was stationed in Alaska.

MACOMs at the end of FY 96 were AMC, the Corps of Engineers, the  Criminal  Investigation  Command,  Eighth  U.S.  Army,  FORSCOM, MEDCOM,  Information  Systems  Command,  Intelligence  and  Security Command (INSCOM), MOW,  Military Traffic Management Command, Special Operations Command (SOCOM), TRADOC, U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), and  Seventh Army,  U.S.  Army,  Pacific  (USARP AC),  and USARSO.  USARPAC, the Army element of the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), was designated as one of the three primary contingency joint task forces. The USARPAC Area of  Responsibility (AOR), largest in the Army, encompassed  16 time zones, 41  nations, 56 percent of  the world's population, 4 of  the world's most  populous countries, and 8 of  the world's largest  armies.  The  37,000  U.S. Forces,  Korea,  soldiers  worked  with 700,000  Republic  of Korea  (ROK)  soldiers  as  part  of the  Combined Forces  Command.  USAREUR's 65,000  soldiers  belonged  to  the  U.S. European  Command (EUCOM),  which covered an AOR comprising  83 nations on 3 continents. Third U.S. Army was the Army component com› mand for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), with 20 nations of  north› east Africa and Southwest Asia in its AOR. USARSO, as part of  SOUTH› COM,  had  3,800  soldiers  and  2,800  civilians  in  an AOR  spanning  19 nations.

At Fort Hood, Texas, the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) was des› ignated  the  Army's EXFOR and  will  serve  to  conduct experiments  for Army XXI. The EXFOR lst Brigade Task Force was formed with a tank battalion and a mechanized battalion from the 4th Infantry Division, and a  light infantry battalion from  the 25th Infantry Division (Light).  During FY 96, the EXFOR Task Force applied and tested new concepts and tech› nologies in preparation for an AWE at the NTC in March  1997. AWEs are an  important element of Force  XXI,  verifying  real  changes to  doctrine, training, and combat developments; the EXFOR AWE will test the "how› to-fight" concept. During the NTC rotation, the EXFOR Task Force and its supporting elements will be maneuvered and monitored as if  they were a division; their equipment, doctrine, force mix, training,  leader develop› ment, and soldiers will all  be evaluated.

The Army is in the process of  fielding eighty-seven different systems to the heavy force in EXFOR and thirty-seven systems to the light forces, including combat computers,  diagnostics,  electronic  POW  information tags, own-the-night equipment, the Land Warrior system, and total asset visibility.  Nearly one hundred concepts have been developed that will be tested  in  the  EXFOR AWE.  ln  response to new  technology,  sixty new draft manuals reflect the changes in tactics, techniques, and procedures; they  will  guide  digitized  operations  from  squad  through  brigade  level. Doctrine has been rewrittenTRADOC has produced Pamphlet 525-5, Force XXI Operations, for digitized and  nondigitized operations as well as  division  organization.  Field  Manual  100- 5, Operations, the  corner› stone of  Army doctrine, is currently being rewritten. To facilitate the tran› sition,  TRADOC  is developing  training  support  packages  for  the EXFOR, including simulators, simulations, and live training, and is con› ducting distance  learning,  all  of which  illuminates  future  standardized training.

To  ensure  that  SOF  are  equipped  to  meet the  twenty-first century, SOCOM selected the 7th Special  Forces  Group  (Airborne)  as the SOF Force XXI test bed and began implementing its own Force XXI initiatives in  June 1995. The first initiative reviewed military intelligence support to the  Special  Forces (SF) groupcurrently consisting of military detach› ments at group and  battalion  levelsand fonned a group-level military intelligence company to  test  whether it could better support subordinate battalions and improve low-density specialty training. Two additional ini› tiatives attached a civil affairs company and a three-person psychological operations  (PSYOP)  element  to  the  group  to  provide  a  more  rapid response to the theater commander and to  satisfy mission requirements. Other initiatives consisted of evaluating the requirements  for  scuba and military free-fall- trained SF  detachments.  In addition, the Special Operations Support Command was formed.

Winning the information war has emerged in Force XXI as critical for battlefield superiority. The Army is attempting to digitize the battlefield so that  military  leaders  in  the  field,  from  squad  to  corps  level,  can  obtain information in real  time  on  terrain,  the  environment,  and  friendly  and threat unit locations. The "tactical internet" is the digitized battlefield that provides rapid, updated, filtered information over interoperable systems to enable commanders to operate effectively and apply appropriate forces at the  right location  when  needed.  At  the  same time,  the Army  recognizes that extensive use of information technology and  digitized data may pre› sent  vulnerabilities as  well  as  strengths. The CSA ordered  a Force  XXI Red  Team,  composed  of the  Army  Digitization  OITice;  the  Director of Information  Systems  for Command,  Control,  Communications,  and Computers;  INSCOM;  CECOM;  and  TECOM,  to  subject  systems  to

information  warfare  attacks,  thereby  identifying  weaknesses  for  which countermeasures can be developed.

In  1996, DOD aru1ounced a five-year plan emphasizing three priori› tics:  readiness, quality of  life, and modernization. By 2000, DOD's  mod› ernization budget was scheduled to increase to $67 billion, a significant rise from FY 96. The Army's modernization plan for a capabilities-based force promotes five objectives: project and sustain the  force, protect the force,  win the information war, conduct precision strikes, and dominate the maneuver battle. To maintain or attain battlefield technological supe› riority,  the  Army  is  working  to  acquire  new  information  technologies, particularly advanced sensors, computers, and communication systems. Major systems are being acquired, including the Crusader field artillery system, THAAD system, Javelin  missile,  and  Comanche armed  recon› naissance  helicopter.  In  addition,  existing systems  such  as  the Abrams tank, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, ATACMS, MLRS, and Apache Longbow weapons system are being upgraded. The Army is also modernizing crit› ical  support systems such  as  trucks,  generators,  radios,  and  individual clothing and equipment. Finally, the Army is retiring many older systems that  are  expensive  to  maintain  a11d  that  provide  only  minimal  combat capability.

## Training

Training is one of  the key clements in creating and maintaining a pro› fessional and ready Army. In leader development, the Army is concentrat› ing  on  developing  decision  making  at  all  levels.  The  warrior  ethos  is emphasized,  while  new  training  concepts  are  linking  schools  to  units, coordinating field training to  simulations and sin1ulators, and embedding training devices in operational equipment. The Guard has developed a dis› tributive training technology  in a  national strategy to connect TRADOC schools, Guard facilities, the Internet, simulations networks, and soldiers' homes. In addition, it will connect the state area commands (STARC), (the sustainment base), with  soldiers deployed worldwide and,  by  providing access to  information, training,  and  knowledge,  will  enhance quality of life. The Regional Distance Learning Demonstration Project is under con› struction  and  currently  connects  nine  distance  learning  classrooms in Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  Virginia,  West  Virgirua, Maryland,  and  the District of  Columbia. Built with cooperation  from the Defense Information Systems Agency, the distance learning network will  be fully compatible  with  other  services  and  future  DOD  worldwide  networks. Course  curricula  designed  by  TRADOC  ensure  high-quality,  mission› essential training. In its "Future Army Schools21st Century" initiative, the Army  is  establishing the TASS,  which integrates  active  and  reserve

component schools.  Reserve  component  instructors  will  replace  active component instructors in training active Army soldiers. In a pilot program, Reserve instructors will also train ROTC cadets.

In addition to readiness, integration of  the active and reserve compo› nents  is  essential to future  success. FORSCOM's ground force readiness enhancement program,  designed  to  provide a collective training evalua› tion for reserve component units and staffs before and after mobilization, reached maturity in FY 96.  All six  regional  training brigades, each with 250 to  300 Army trainers and a headquarters staff of 40 personnel, have been established and arc at 50 percent of  their required personnel strength. The regional training brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington, is at 100 percent strength;  it  conducted  annual  training  for  the  41st  and  81 st  Infantry Brigades (Guard enhanced readiness brigades) in FY 96. The ground force readiness enhancement program also detailed four hundred Army trainers to five divisions (exercise) within the Reserve.

The Army operates NTC at Fort Irwin, California; JRTC at Fort Polk, Louisiana;  and the Combat  Maneuver  Training  Center  (CMTC)  at Hohenfels, Germany, all  of which  use  field  exercises  to  improve  readi› ness.  NTC trained more than 40,000 soldiers in FY 96 in  12 rotations of brigade task  forces  (2 battalions each), of  which  11  were from the active component  and I from  the  Guard.  At  JRTC,  nearly  20,000  soldiers received training in  10 rotations of  brigade task forces (3 battalions each).

As  an  example  of training,  the Florida Army National  Guard's 53d Infantry Brigade  (Light),  one  of  the  enhanced  readiness  brigades, deployed 4,500 soldiers to JRTC at night under blackout conditions, air› landing one infantry battalion via a C- 130 aircraft, inserting two infantry battalions  and  a  field  artillery  battery  by  helicopter,  and  conducting  a ground move protected by an attack helicopter battalion. The brigade then conducted  six  infantry platoon  movement-to-contact live-fire  exercises, six 81-mm. mortar platoon  live-fire exercises, two  107  -mm.  mortar pla› toon live-fire exercises, and three 105-mm. field artillery battery live-fire exercises. Having conducted a successful exercise without incurring any damage to property or suffering any serious personnel injuries, the brigade redeployed  to  home  station  after  receiving  commendations  from  the observer-controllers  and  opposing  forces.  Another  enhanced  readiness brigade, Louisiana' s 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), participated in a combat training center (CTC)-Iike rotation at Fort Hood, Texas,  pro› gressing from company team to task force level  operations and  incorpo› rating close air,  engineer,  air defense, and indirect fires.  The 256th  now meets Army strength, equipment, and readiness standards.

At  CMTC  in  Hohenfels,  five  task force  rotations  (three  battalions each)  were  conducted  in  FY  96.  A  battalion task  force  usually  has  one conventional  CMTC rotation  annually.  Units scheduled to participate in

Task Force ABLE SENTRY  in Macedonia, however, received specific train› ing in peace support operations, while those preparing for Partnership for Peace exercises received training in conventional and peace support oper› ations.  Units  called to  the  Implementation Force (IFOR)  to  support the Dayton  Peace Accords  in  Bosnia received specific training in  enforcing treaties,  establishing and  enforcing  an  operations  zone,  removing mines and  other  hazards, relocating  refugees,  and  inspecting  facilities  and forces.

The  Jungle  Operations  Training  Center  (JOTC),  at  Fort  Sherman, Panama, is the only Army site for collective jungle training for  light, air› borne, Ranger, air assault, and Marine Corps infantry.  In addition, JOTC conducts  the  engineer jungle  warfare  course  and  the  aircrew  survival course,  and  routinely  trains  allied  exchange  platoons.  During  FY  96, eleven infantry battalion rotations occurred at JOTC.

The Battle Command Training Program, located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, conducted 2 corps warfighter exercise (WFX) equivalents, 7 divi› sion  WFX  equivalents,  12  reserve  component brigade  battle  command and  battle  staff training exercises, and  12  Operations Group Delta Joint Task Force exercises.

rn  FY  96,  approximately  $33  million  was  invested  in  new  training facilities.  A  Close  Combat Tactical  Trainer  (CCTC)  was  built  at  Fort Benning,  Georgia, for $4.9 million;  Fort Knox, Kentucky,  also acquired one that cost $5.6 million.  A  new  infantry  platoon  battle  course at Fort Drum, New York,  cost $3.8 million  to  construct, while an armor range, also  built at Fort Drum, required $5.02 million. At Fort Eustis, Virginia, $5.4 million was expended to develop a deployment training facility, and $8.5  million  was  spent at  Fort  Lewis,  Washington,  for  a  multipurpose training range.

Participation in  exercises  is  fundamental  for Army  readiness.  More than 55,000 FORSCOM soldiers participated in 21  major joint exercises, including  BRIGHT  STAR, BLUE  FLAG,  and FUERTES  DEFENSAS (Strong Defenses). These exercises were designed to improve military-to-military relationships, enhance U.S. presence in critical regions, and improve joint and  combined operations.  In  EXCALIBUR  96,  HQDA  satisfactorily  prac› ticed  its  Continuity  of Operations Plan, in  which  key  functional  offices within the Army Staff  (Emergency Relocation Group) were denied the use of their normal Pentagon workspaces and were directed to relocate to an emergency relocation site. POSITIVE FoRCE 96, a mobilization exercise for executing two major theater wars, was postponed until FY 97 due to real› world deployments to Southwest Asia in October 1996.

USARSO supported Honduras and Uruguay with exercises FuERZAS ALIADAS (Allied Forces) and FuERZAS UNIDAS (United Forces), respective› ly.  These exercises aided  the  countries' militaries in executing  multina-

tiona! peacekeeping CPX (command post exercises),  an important mis› sion as Latin American armies acquire new peacekeeping responsibilities.

Third Army  soldiers  in CENTCOM planned,  coordinated,  and  sup› ported ten  separate series  of recurring,  bilateral  exercises  with  regional nations, ranging from company team to battalion task force size and exe› cuted by active and reserve FORSCOM  and  USAREUR  units. CENTCOM's largest  exercise  is  BRIGHT  STAR,  conducted  in  Egypt  by Third Army, which serves as the Joint Task Force (JTF) headquarters. Tn 1995, BRIGHT STAR  involved 60,000 participants from  five  nations,  with 20,000  of those  from  the United  States, in a  deep  attack  scenario  with AH-64 Apache helicopters from the United States, Egypt, and the United Arab  Emirates.  Third  Army  soldiers  also  participated in ULTIMATE REsOLVE,  INTERNAL LoOK, ROVING  SANDS, and BLUE FLAG.

In the EUCOM AOR, USAREUR executed eleven training exercises from JTF level to multinational interoperability. In  1995, USAREUR sol› diers participated in 6 PfP exercises involving 22 of  the 27 nations partic› ipating  in  the  program.  PfP exercise PEACEFUL  EAGLE,  held  in  Albania, encompassed  the  participation  of Bulgaria,  Greece,  Italy,  Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Turkey, and the United States. Designed to build trust and  confidence  among  southern  European  countries,  the  two-battalion exercise included platoon training, company field training, and a battalion staff  exercise.

USARPAC soldiers participated in 16 JCS (Joint Chiefs of  Staff) exer› cises, 2 army-to-army FTXs (field training exercises), and 3 CPXs. These occurred  at  JRTC,  at  NTC,  and  in  the  Philippines,  Japan,  Australia, Singapore,  and  Thailand.  Southeast  Asia's  premier  training  exercise, COBRA GOLD 96, was a multinational air, land, sea, and amphibious exer› cise in  Thailand sponsored by PACOM in which 19,000 U.S. and Thai mil› itary  personnel  participated  to  improve  interoperability  and  to  demon› strate U.S. resolve to support Asian nations. BALIKATAN 95 was held in the Philippines and involved more than 300 U.S. Army personnel. An annual joint and combined CPX that focused on U.S. rapid deployment to Korea, ULCHT Focus LENS, was conducted with ROK forces.

Military-to-military programs promote interoperability, enhance pro› fessional understanding, build lasting bonds with other nations, and some› times assist  in democratization processes. USARPAC's  Expanded Relations  Program  (ERP)  initiative,  which  supports  Asian  and  Pacific nations as well  as  U.S.  strategic goals,  promotes army-to-army dialogue and  contributes  toward  developing and  modernizing  Asian  and  Pacific ground forces.  In  FY 96,  150  ERP  missions  were  conducted  through senior officer visits, staff  information exchanges, conferences, humanitar› ian  assistance,  individual  and  unit  training  exchanges, and bilateral and joint exercises.  Specific events  included  the  annual  CGSC team visit  to

India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan; representation on the Mutual Defense Board with the Philippines; and the annual PACOM staff talks with Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Key ERP events in FY 96 were the annual JCS exercises ULCHI Focus LENS, FOAL EAGLE, and RSOJ (Reception,  Staging,  Onward  Movement,  and Integration)  in  Korea,  as well as ORIENT SHIELD  in Japan; and Army exercises YAMA  SAKURA  and NORTHWIND in Japan.

Another  USARPAC  initiative  is  the  INDO-U.S.  Executive  Steering Group, created to develop army-to-army programs between India and the United  States  and  to  improve  relationships  with  senior  Indian  leaders. Senior  officer  visits, observer  exchanges,  conferences,  and  training opportunities  have  increased  the  level  of confidence  between  the  two countries, improved Indian military professionalism, and helped to devel› op similar programs with other countries. To enhance interactions between allied  and  friendly  armies of the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean region, USARPAC established the Pacific Armies Management Seminar. Since its inception, participation  has  grown  from  nine nations  to  the  thirty-seven present at the March  1996 seminar in  Bangkok, Thailand. Two  hundred military personnel,  including twenty general officers, attended the semi› nar, which was cohosted by USARPAC and the Royal Thai Army.

To  build  regional  cooperation  and  aid  in  the  counterdrug  effort, USARSO conducts a distinguished visitor program, which consists of  rec› iprocal two- to  three-day visits between the USARSO commanding gen› eral and  commanding  generals  of Latin  American  armies.  In 1996, USARSO  received distinguished visitors from Belize, Panama, Venezuela, Bolivia,  Colombia, Guatemala, and Suriname. ln return, the USARSO commanding general visited Brazil, El Salvador, Peru, Bolivia, and  Venezuela. USARSO  also  conducted  platoon  exchanges  with Venezuela,  Argentina,  and  Uruguay,  and  conducted  the  first  combined FTX in Belize between U.S. and Belize forces.

The Nuevos  Horizontes (New Horizons) nations assistance program was  an  important  element  in  U.S. efforts  at  nation  building. Nuevos Horizontes consisted  of three  JCS exercises in 1996.  Soldiers  from  the California Army National Guard participated in Joint Task Force Eureka in  Panama;  from  Alabama's 8 Lst  Regional  Support  Command  in  Joint Task  Force  926 in Honduras;  and from  USARSO's  536th  Combat Engineer Battalion (Heavy) in Joint  Task Force Builder in El Salvador and Ecuador.

Nation-building  exercises  were  a  significant  accomplishment  by USARSO soldiers.  Overseas-deployment-for-training exercises benefited Latin American countries as well  as Army soldiers. In 1996, active  and reserve  component  engineers  in  Belize,  Honduras,  Costa  Rica,  and Panama  built  or repaired  37  schools,  5  clinics,  15  water  wells,  and  6

bridges. In addition,  they  built  or  improved  nearly  fifty  kilometers  of farm-to-market roads.  Medical, dental, and  veterinarian  professionals  in 16 medical readiness training exercises in 8 countries treated 40,000 med› ical patients, 8,000 dental patients, and more than 20,000 animals.

## Deployed Operational Forces

The Army  maintains  125,000 soldiers  forward-deployed  in  Europe, the Pacific, and Panama. On any given day, an average of21,500 soldiers are deployed from their home stations around the world.  During FY 96, 38,000 soldiers were deployed in  more than 60 countries in  military oper› ations other than war.

Operation JOINT ENDEAVORin which U.S. forces supported NATO in monitoring and enforcing the Dayton Peace Accords in Bosnia in one of the  largest  peacetime operations since World  War  IIproved  to  be  the most significant deployment of  the Army in FY 96. JoiNT ENDEAVOR was also NATO's first  operational  commitment of forces,  the  first time  U.S. Army soldiers had served in  Eastern Europe in substantial  numbers,  the first  time American  and  Russian  troops  had shared a common  mission, and the first cold weather combat operation since the Korean War. Before JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  Army  soldiers  were  participating  in  Operation DENY FLIGHT,  enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia; SF soldiers conducted com› bat  search-and-rescue.  On  8  December  1995,  a  Presidential  Selected Reserve  Call-up  was  signed  and,  within  ten  days,  7,745  unit  soldiers (2,082 Guard, 5,663 Reserve) and 350 Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) were mobilized, nearly all for the 270 days authorized by law. The majority of  the units backfilled or augmented staffs and units in Germany,  particularly  in  postal,  military  police,  movement  control, logistics, aviation, personnel  administration,  finance,  military  intelli› gence, and maintenance functions. Some units deployed to Bosnia to per› form civil affairs, PSYOP, public affairs, firefighting, military history, rear area  operations,  fire  support,  aviation,  logistics,  and  maintenance  mis› sions. CONUS and forward-deployed active duty civil affairs, PSYOP, SF, and  SOF  aviation  units  of the  lOth  Special  Forces  Group  (Airborne) immediately  began  preparing  for liaison  with  NATO countries  and deployed to support the IFOR that would soon arrive.

Sixteen Guard  units  in  twenty-two  states  were  mobilized.  With  an average of  four days between call-up and arrival at mobilization stations, these units demonstrated their baseline readiness. A Kansas target acqui› sition battery (minus) supplied counterbattery radar coverage at Sarajevo Airport while a Pennsylvania fire support element provided fire direction support for the Nordic Brigade. A few units remained in CONUS to sup› port mobilization and  to  backfill deployed units. All  reserve component

requirements  for  SOF,  medical,  postal,  finance,  mobilization  support, logistics, and  firefighting units were filled from the Reserve. At the end ofFY 96, 74 percent of  all reserve component units supporting Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR  were  from  139 Reserve units. During 1996, two addi› tional  mobilizations  of reserve  components  occurred,  as  soldiers  and units were deployed in  successive 270-day rotations to take the place of those  returning  from  active  duty  commitments.  The  FY  96  National Defense  Authorization  Act  reimbursed  lost  income  up  to  $5,000  per month  for  mobilized  Guard  and  Reserve  soldiers.  In  addition,  DOD authorized a test program  that  waived  deductibles  for  CHAMPUS (Civilian  Health  and  Medical  Program of the Uniformed  Services)  for mobilized Guard members.

Recognizing that extensive predeployment preparation was needed for the IFOR, USAREUR immediately organized nondeploying units to train and  support  the  deploying  force.  Individual  training  focused  on  mine awareness, checkpoint operations, rules of  engagement, and negotiations, while CPXs and fire-coordination exercises targeted intelligence and fire control  systems.  All deploying  units trained together  at CMTC  in Hohenfels,  replicating  the  Zone  of Separation  they  would  establish  in Bosnia under similar conditions.  ISLAND THUNDER and FORWARD RESOLVE were two  USAREUR exercises  that tested contingency and deployment plans.  MOUNTAIN  EAGLE  was a capstone exercise that certified the  force and served as mission rehearsal. Mountain  SHIELD  II  certified the Southern  European  Task  Force  to  serve  as  a  JTF  with  the  mission  of extracting  United  Nations  (UN)  forces  from  a  hostile  environment.  In addition,  lessons  learned  from  Operation  DESERT  STORM  resulted  in  a comprehensive training program for nondeployers. Family assistance cen› ters,  family  support  groups,  and  rear  detachments  gained  new  skills, ensuring that 95  percent of all  families  remained  in  theater during  the twelve-month deployment.

During a  bitter winter  storm  in  late  December,  with accompanying snow,  rain,  mud,  and flooding,  the  502d Engineer Company constructed the longest assault bridge in modern history. When trucks and boats could not accomplish the job in extreme weather, helicopters transported six-ton bridge segments and dropped them into the Sava River between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to  be  maneuvered  into location by  boat crews. In conjunction with USAREUR's intermediate staging base in  Hungary, the Sava River bridge enabled deployment ofTask Force Eagle (the !FOR) equipment and  personncl373  trains  with 7,187  rail  cars;  1,408 cargo plane sorties; and 2,047 transport vehicles moving 5,000 tracked vehicles, wheeled vehicles, and containers. Task Force Eagle deployed into twenty› four  base camps,  with  soldiers  sleeping for weeks  in  makeshift camps, abandoned  buildings,  or  their  vehicles  while  establishing  the  Zone  of

Separation to monitor the peace agreement. The U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory offered commanders and staff  guid› ance to overcome the hostile winter environment.

The  1st Armored  Division  formed  the  basis  of Task  Force  Eagle, which  was reinforced  by  USAREUR, V  Corps,  the  Southern European Task Force, other U.S.  Army assets, and  fifteen  brigade-size units from eleven  NATO  allies  and  former  Warsaw  Pact  countries,  including  a Russian airborne brigade. USAREUR alone deployed 23,000 soldiers to JOI NT ENDEAVOR. Some units have returned to home station or relocated to bases  in  rim  countries.  Military  police and  lighter forces  have  replaced armored  and  mechanized  inf antry  units.  As Task Force Eagle  elements redeploy, retraining  is  conducted  at  the  Taborfalva  Training  Area  in Hungary. USAREUR is now focused on sustaining, maintaining, support› ing, and redeploying U.S.  forces in Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary through the  USAREUR (Forward)  command  post  in  Taszar,  Hungary,  and  the National Support  Element,  2 1st  Theater  Army  Area  Command,  in Kaposvar, Hungary. Sustaining the deployed force requires a daily flow of 3 convoys and  12  air  sorties  carrying  75,000 meals;  192,000 gallons of water; 130,000 gallons of  fuel; and 133 short tons of  supplies. The success of Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR  and  other missions  in  the Balkan  region resulted in free elections in  Bosnia in September 1996.

For FORSCOM soldiers,  thousands of  whom  were  deployed during FY 96 for operations or training,  the average length of time absent from home station was 140 days. FORSCOM soldiers played a vital role in pro› viding  humanitarian relief to  Haitians and  Cubans  at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in Operation SEA  SIGNAL.  In CONSTANT VIGIL, a CENTCOM oper› ation, FORSCOM soldiers assisted in deterring aggression while gaining valuable joint and combined training.

Hundreds  of USARSO  soldiers  deploy  temporarily  for  exercises, nation-building activities,  counterdrug operations,  and  civic action  pro› grams.  In  Ecuador,  USARSO  assumed  base  operational  support  for Operation  SAFE  BoRDER, the  U.S.  contribution  to the UN  Military Observer Mission in  that country. Since  1995, USARSO has sent thirty› five  soldiers  and  four  UH-60  Black  Hawk  helicopters  to  support  the multinational observer contingent in  Patuca, Ecuador, to peaceably settle the long-term border dispute between Peru and Ecuador.

U.S. Army  troops  deployed  to  Haiti under  Operation  UPHOLD DEMOCRACY,  beginning  in  September 1994, to support a UN mission to restore  the democratically  elected government to  power.  SOF and other U.S.  forces  had been poised to conduct a forced entry but quickly shifted focus  when  the  mission  was  changed  through  successful diplomacy. Although the last of  those SOF elements departed Haiti in February 1996, a  Presidential  Selected  Reserve  Call-up  in  May  1996  mobilized  2,100

reservists  from  the  Guard  and  Reserve for UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY.  Initial requirements for port operations, civil  affairs, PSYOP, and  SF personnel gave way to needs for logistical, aviation, military police, engineer, postal, and transportation units. More than 70 percent of  the reserve forces came from the Reserve. Until April 1996, Army soldiers helped the Haitian gov› ernment maintain order, develop a security force, and repatriate refugees. The current mission includes high-visibility patrols and provision of  secu› rity for food convoys. The Army also provides a quick reaction force to the UN  Mission  and  trained  5,275  Haitian  National  Police  at Fort  Leonard Wood, Missouri, from June 1995 to early 1996.

In  the  CENTCOM AOR,  Operation SOUTHERN  WATCH  enforces  the no-fly zone below the 32d parallel in  southern Iraq that was imposed  by the UN after the  Persian  Gulf War to  protect coalition forces  from  Iraqi aircraft. Although primarily air assets are involved in  SouTHERN  WATCH, 1,500 Army soldiers providing fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and other support were assisting the JTF. From August to December 1995, VIGILANT SENTINEL deterred Iraqi aggression with major contingency deployments from ARCENT (U.S. Army Central Command). In September 1996, Iraq fired missiles  at  a  U.S. aircraft, challenging  multinational  forces  in SOUTHERN  WATCH.  The United  States retaliated  with  Operation DESERT STRJKE, in which Army units participated, disabling Iraqi air defenses with Tomahawk and cruise missiles in a show offorce designed to deter further Iraqi  aggression.  ln response, the UN  imposed additional sanctions; the no-fly  zone  was  expanded  to  the  33d  parallel;  additional  troops  were deployed to the region; and Operation NORTHERN WATCH  was implement› ed, enforcing a new no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in northern Iraq. Army units also participated in DESERT FALCON, a show of  force in FY 96 to deter Iraqi aggression in northern Iraq, and PROVIDE  COMFORT, an ongo› ing operation to protect Kurds in  northern Iraq from Iraqi attacks.

The  United States,  concerned  with  Iraqi aggression  toward  Kuwait, deployed 3,500 soldiers from  the 24th Infantry Division to Kuwait as part of  VIGILANT  THUNDER in 1996  to  preclude  Iraqi  retaliatory  strikes. INTRfNSTCACTION, initiated in  1993, is a continuous show offorce by com› bined U.S.  and Kuwaiti forces  to deter Iraqi aggression. A U.S.  battalion task force  deploys  twice  yearly  to  conduct  combined exercises  with  the Kuwaiti Army.  In FY 96,  1,475  soldiers  from  the  3rd  Infantry Division and 1,400 from the  l  st Cavalry Division participated in INTRINSIC ACTION in two separate rotations.

CENTCOM is nearing its goal of  pre-positioning a full heavy division in Southwest Asia.  In spring  1995, Army war reserve combat equipment to  equip  the  first  full  brigade  was  put in place at Camp  Doha, outside Kuwait  City  in  Kuwait.  ARCENT-Kuwait oversees  the  equipment and conducts  joint  and  combined  training in Kuwait. In March 1996,

ARCENT-Qatar  was  established  and  outfitted  with  Army  war  reserve combat equipment for an armor battalion task force (the initial element of another full  brigade) and  the division base. ARCENT  - Saudi Arabia  pro› vides command and control for the Patriot air defense artillery task force, PROVIDE  COVER,  which, deployed in both Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia, was composed  from  FORSCOM  and  USAREUR  elements.  In  addition, ARCENT  -Saudi Arabia provides the command and control structure for theater ballistic missile defense  in  the  regi011.  These three command and control activities will facilitate a transition to war in the region. INTRINSIC ACTION forces use the Army war reserve combat equipment pre-positioned at ARCENT-Kuwait.  In April  1996, a  task force  from  the  24th Infantry Division, deployed to the United Arab Emirates, conducted the first annu› al exercise to equip and sustain a full combat brigade from equipment pre› positioned afloat by unloading Army war reserve combat equipment off  of five ships on station in the CENTCOM AOR.

On 25 June 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside the  military com› pound at Khobar Towers in  Saudi Arabia, killing nineteen Air Force ser› vice members. DOD dhected commanders in Southwest Asia to take addi› tional  protective measures.  In  accordance with CENTCOM's force pro› tection/relocation  plan,  DESERT  Focus,  published  in  July,  Army  forces moved  to  locations  that were  more defensible  and  deployed  an  infantry battalion  to protect Patriot sites and other Army facilities. DESERT Focus now refers only to  the protection mission of  the infantry battalion.

The United States maintains no bases in Africa but does participate in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. In an effort to promote region› al stability, the United States fosters democratic institutions, helps protect natural  resources, and supports national  development. The U.S.  military offers exchange programs and trains African soldiers.  Nevertheless, U.S. armed forces do sometimes become involved in internal crises on the con› tinent, particularly when U.S. citizens are involved.  On 4 April  1996, fac› tional fighting in Monrovia, Liberia, cut the American embassy's  access to the  airport,  which  then  closed  on  6  April.  The  following  day,  Special Operations  Command,  Europe,  began  conducting  Operation  AssURED RESPONSE,  evacuating  400  U.S.  citizens and  1,700 foreigners  between 9 and  20 April,  using  an  intermediate  staging  base  at  Freetown,  Sierra Leone, and a safe haven in Dakar, Senegal. Army soldiers were deployed from the 3d Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry; 1st Battalion, 1Oth Special Forces Group; 3d Battalion,  I  60th Special Operations Aviation Regiment; and the Southern European Task Force.

In April  1996,  USAREUR forces  were participating  in  six  separate large-scale  operations  at  once  in  Macedonia,  Saudi  Arabia,  Hungary, Bosnia, Croatia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In addition to the 23,000 sol› diers serving in JoiNT ENDEAVOR, USAREUR also deployed 7,000 soldiers

to Hungary  and  Italy,  and  5,000  to  Croatia.  Under  Operation  ABLE SENTRY,  as part of a  UN mission, the United States has been monitoring Macedonia's border with Serbia and reporting violations to UN sanctions for  three  years.  Every  six  months,  a  USAREUR combat  battalion  task force of  approximately 525 personnel deploys to Macedonia. Historically, only infantry units performed the mission; from April to September 1996; however, the first armor battalion executed the task. As one unit prepares for the mission, a second executes, and a third recovers and retrains. ABLE SENTRY  was scheduled to  end in May  1997, but the UN Security Council extended the mission for six more months.

Fifty  thousand  soldiers were  based  in  Korea,  Hawaii, Alaska,  and Japan  in FY 96.  As  an  example  of USARPAC  deployments,  soldiers from  the 45th  Corps Support Group  (Forward) were  deployed  in  May 1996  to  Germany,  Bosnia,  Hungary,  the  Sinai,  the  island  of Kosrae, Kwajalein Atoll, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, and CONUS. Soldiers were also sent to Cuba and other locations in support of CENTCOM and  the  U.S.  Atlantic  Command.  USARPAC  soldiers were assigned permanently  to  the Investigation and Recovery Team of JTF Full  Accounting,  which  conducts  investigations,  excavations,  and recovery operations  to  find  missing American  military members  from the Vietnam War.

The Army provides nearly  l ,000 soldiers to the Multinational  Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai, an independent (non-UN) peacekeep› ing mission, created as a result of  the  1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Treaty  of Peace.  The  United  States,  Israel,  Egypt,  Germany,  and Japan fund  the  MFO's expenses.  Since  1982, various nations  have con› ttibuted military and  civilian  personnel  to  serve in  approximately  thirty remote operational sites in the Sinai Peninsula ofEgypt. U.S. participation consists of one light infantry battalion, which  rotates  every six months, and one support battalion, which rotates once a year. In FY 96, battalion› size task forces of  approximately 350 personnel began or ended three sep› arate tours of duty.  Soldiers operate checkpoints, reconnaissance patrols, and  observation  posts along the  international  boundary  to  verify  treaty implementation. In December 1995, the CSA approved a study on includ› ing  reserve  component  soldiers  in  future  rotations  to  reduce  the  PER› STEMPO for the active Army. USAREUR also provided a small element to support a UN observer mission in Tblisi, Georgia.

The U.S. Army increasingly supports disaster relief and humanitarian missions.  In  Operations  MARATHON  PACIFIC  and  PACIFIC  HAVEN,  Army units offered  humanitarian and civic assistance. In PACIFIC  HAVEN,  thou› sands of Kurds and other persons in  northern Iraq who had  been threat› ened by the Iraqi government were evacuated to Andersen Air Force Base (South),  Guam,  beginning  16  September  1996.  JTF Pacific  Haven  sup-

plied shelter,  processing,  care, and security for  6,600 evacuees prior to their final relocation. USARPAC sent the JTF's  Army element, which con› sisted  primarily  of infantry,  military  police,  and  K9  dog  teams,  whose tasks were to provide security for  the refugees. Additional soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division; FORSCOM; SOCOM; INSCOM; U.S. Army, Alaska; MEDCOM; and USAR, Guam, provided administration, medical, engineering, public affairs, PSYOP, civil affairs, and linguistic support.

As  the  DOD  Executive  Agent  for  Military  Support  to  Civil Authorities,  the Army extended  support dw·ing FY  96  in  various major disasters,  usually weather catastrophes. In  1996, the Director of  Military Support (DOMS) sent troops to  stem  floodwaters  and assist victims  in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, New York, and Calif ornia. When Hurricanes Bertha, Edouard, and Hortense hit the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  and  Puerto  Rico,  airlift  assets,  personnel,  and equipment were deployed. Army personnel also assisted South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia during Hurricane Fran. In addition, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of  Columbia received Army assistance during the blizzard of 1996. To suppress wildfires in Alaska and California, the Army sent 1  ,200 active duty personnel and eight military airborne fire› fighting systems to assist local authorities. During a natural gas explosion in  Puerto Rico, the Army sent two urban search and rescue teams.

In 1996, DOMS created a Domestic Preparedness Section to imple› ment  the  Defense  Against  Weapons  of Mass  Destruction  Act,  which authorizes federal agencies to assist state and local agencies responding to terrorist incidents. In July 1996,when TWA Flight 800 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after taking off  from Kennedy Airport, New York, the Army supported its recovery with 630 active duty soldiers and sup› port  equipment. In addition to the  10,000 soldiers deployed to support the 1996  Summer  Olympic  Games  in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  Army  personnel assisted law enforcement personnel following the bombing of  Centennial Olympic Park.

The Anny's counterdrug budget in FY 96 was $230 million. Working with the Utah Army  National Guard, the Army digitized the Transcriptionffranslation  Support  System  in  Draper,  Utah,  to  increase support to the Drug Enforcement Administration. An increase in training of drug law  enforcement agencies by Army Mobile Training Teams and TRADOC also occurred. In October 1995, the United States and Mexico agreed that the U.S. Army would train instructors for new Mexican coun› terdrug  SF units;  conduct pilot and  aviation  maintenance  training;  and establish  an  airmobile  capability.  Counterdrug  training  for  instructors began in April  1996 at the School of  the Americas, Fort Benning, Georgia, with follow-on training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky. By September 2000, I  26 instructors per year will have received

training. The Helicopter School of  the Americas at Fort Rucker, Alabama, began conducting UH- 1  H pilot and aviation maintenance training for 450 Mexican Air Force personnel annually through 2001. In April 1996, DOD tasked  the Army  to  transfer 73  UH-lH helicopters to  Mexico;  all  heli› copters, spare parts, and aviation ground  support are  to  be delivered  by September 1997. In June  1996, the Army was directed further to provide and install  a UHLH  flight simulator in Mexico by April  1998 to sustain initial pilot training.

Army SOF participated in 850 missions in 101 different countries dur› ing FY 96, with highly visible missions being those in Haiti, Bosnia, and Liberia. ln Kuwait, SOF created a permanent presence with its lRJs GoLD exercise  series,  in  which  it  enhances  command  and  control,  integrates joint forces, and coordinates joint/combined war plans. One SF company rotates every  I  20 days  through lRJS  GoLD.  Another vital SOF mission is demining.  In  June I 996,  DOD  implemented  a  new  plan  that  would improve  mine  detection  and  clearing  technology,  share  the  technology internationally,  and  assist  foreign  nations  in  developing  humanitarian demining programs. The seventeen nations supported by the United States are Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Chad,  Costa Rjca, Eritrea, Ethiopia,  Honduras,  Jordan,  Laos,  Lebanon,  Mozambique,  Namibia, Nicaragua, Rwanda, and Yemen; Zimbabwe and Guatemala are under con› sideration  for  inclusion.  SOF conducts the  humarutarian demffijng  pro› grams in all countries except Afghanistan and Namibia. Civil affairs sol› diers  assist  host  nations  in  developing  the  infrastructure for a  demining program; PSYOP elements assist in  media campaigns to increase public awareness;  and  SF  personnel  teach  mine  clearance  techniques  such  as locating, mapping, and destruction in place, but not mine removal.

## Military Intelligence

Army  military  intelligence  (MI)  priorities  during FY 96  were  con› cerned with supporting operational deployments and preparing to support Army  XXI.  New  intelligence collection,  processing,  and  disserrunation systems  featuring  information-age  technologies  were  fielded  in  Haiti, Macedonia,  and  Bosnia.  Use  of these  new  systems  imparted  lessons learned  from  which  new tactics,  techniques, and procedures were devel› oped for the  benefit of other units  and the EXFOR. The lessons learned will  also  be  applicable  to  new  systems  such  as  the  Common  Ground Station, Advanced Quickfix, and the Ground-Based Common Sensor.

Force  XXI  demands  new  intelligence  organizations  at every  level from echelons above corps to maneuver brigade, beginning with a small› er,  modular,  and  more  flexible  and  deployable  divisional  MI  battalion. Though smaller than its predecessor by eighty-three personnel spaces, the

new MI battalion includes a direct support MI company for each maneu› ver brigade;  organic signal intelligence and imagery colH~ction systems with targeting ability; real-time "sensor-to-shooter" links; an analysis and control team equipped with the All-Source Analysis System; a Common Ground Station; and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Ground Control Station.

During FY 96, to  reduce vulnerabilities of information systems,  MI established the Land  Information  Warfare  Activity  (LIWA)  within INSCOM; began the Force XXI  Red Team effort; developed a Command and Control Protect Management Plan to protect information capabilities; and  conducted  the  first  tactical-level  information  operations  war game. LIWA,  a  forty-person  organization  supported  by  information  warfare activities  from  the Army and other military services,  integrates informa› tion warfare into its activities and provides commanders with an addition› al  tool  for  success in  battle.  The  LIWA  conducted  vulnerability assess› ments  of U.S.  forces  in  Bosnia  and  is  forming  a  computer-emergency response team to help protectArmy information systems.

In May J 995,  the  commanding  general,  U.S.  Army  Intelligence Center, established an Information Operations Task Force and directed it to conduct an  information operations war game that would develop oper› ational and tactical concepts and doctrine. Conducted in November  1995, the  war game portrayed  a corps-size force  in  a  major regional  conflict. Eighty-two participants from twenty-seven Army, joint, and national orga› nizations used simulations along with command and control warfare plan› ning tools to address information operations issues. One of  the key lessons resulting  from  the  after-action  plan in  1996  was that the Army needs  to work harder at utilizing information-age technology while protecting dis› semination and providing information to operators.

To provide Force XXI with the capability for battlefield visualization, the  CSA,  in  May  1995, directed  the  development of a battlefield visual› ization management plan and a battlefield visualization advanced concept technology demonstration; he also requested that the JCS address the lack of  digital terrain elevation data. The Rapid  Terrain Visualization Advanced Technology Demonstration will evaluate technologies for collecting, pro› cessing, and delivering rapid high-resolution digital terrain elevation data. The Battlespace  Command  and  Control Advanced  Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) will develop the system on which to portray the high-resolution  data,  with  enemy and  friendly  forces  overlaid on a  high fidelity,  three-dimensional  view  of the  battlespace.  The two  demonstra› tions  will  be  merged  into  the  Rapid  Battlefield Visualization ACTO  to provide a single system for rendering a virtual rendition of  the battlespace before engaging the enemy.

The Army has produced a prototype battlefield visualization system that was first used in September 1995 to depict a corps exercise area in

Panama.  In  subsequent  exercises  in  FY 96,  friendly  forces  data  were added  along  with  modular,  semiautomated  forces. During  exercise ROYAL DRAGON io May 1996, the prototype battlefield visualization sys› tem used live intelligence feeds from the Guardrail Common Sensor, the Air Force U- 2, long-range reconnaissance company digital imagery, and other systems for the first time. The system was integrated with Army battle command systems to  receive enemy forces dispositions from  the All-Source  Analysis  System and  fliendly data  from Phoenix,  the Maneuver Control System; both were displayed on a high fidelity,  vir› tual replication of  the exercise area. The Army plans to insert this proto› type  in  the Rapid  Battlefield Visualization ACTD for further develop› ment  and  to  demonstrate  it  at  the  March  1997  AWE  in  Fort  Irwin, California.

At that AWE, the EXFOR will also employ new intelligence and elec› tronic warfare systems as weJI  as higher-echelon collectors and downlinks that  provide  intelligence  in  real  or  near-real  time.  Already  fielded  to EXFOR  arc  the  All-Source  Analysis  System,  Commander's Tactical Terminal, Common Ground Station, Mobile Integrated Tactical Terminal, Ground-Based Common Sensor, Trojan Spirit II, Advanced Quickfix, and Unmanned Aerial  Vehicle-short  range.  Higher-echelon  supporting  sys› tems include Guardrail Common Sensor, Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar  System,  Modernized  Imagery  Exploitation  System,  Enhanced Tactical  Radar  Corrclator,  and  Airborne  Reconnaissance  Low.  Three Advanced Quickfix systems are being built in FY 96 and 97 at a low rate of production, prior to  a decision  being made to proceed with fuJI  pro› duction. Advanced Quickfix is a helibome system that provides division and  armored  cavalry  regiment  commanders  with  an  organic  ability  to locate targets, determine an opponent's  order of  battle, attack enemy com› mand and control, and locate threatening radar emissions. The Ground› Based Common Sensor,  mounted  on  a  wheeled or tracked vehicle,  has similar capabilities to  the Advanced Quickfix. This ground sensor,  how› ever, is  the Army's only asset that can process signals intelligence, locate precision targets,  and attack enemy electronics at any time of  the day or night, in any weather and on any terrain. In addition, the system is mobile, is not dependent on other systems to carry out its mission, and provides its  troops  significant protection from  enemy  fire,  particularly when  the sensor  is  mounted  on  the  electronic  variant  of the  Bradley  Fighting Vehicle.

## Nuclem;  Biological, and Chemical Issues

On 22 August 1996, the first nerve agent (GB)-filled M55 rocket was destroyed  successfully  at Tooele  Chemical  Disposal  Facility  at Tooele

Army Depot, Utah. Sixty rockets were moved on 21 August and 180 on 23 August from  a storage igloo to  the disposal facility  for processing. The Army had voluntarily postponed operations for fifty-seven days until the U.S. District Court for Utah could act upon a suit filed  by private groups to  halt  the  start-up  of the  facility.  After  a  nine-day  hearing,  the  court declined to  halt the process. The private groups then filed a motion on 22 August with  the Utah  Solid and  Hazardous Waste Control Board to pre› vent the start of  operations, but the Board conducted an emergency meet› ing and denied the motion that same day.

## Theater Missile Defense

In FY 96, the Army substantially advanced its theater missile defense capabilities, initiating plans to extend the range of the Army tactical  mis› sile system to treaty limits. Fielding THAAD, requiJed for active defense› in-depth  and  area  protection,  is  a leading  priority  of the  Space  and Strategic Defense Command (SSDC). THAAD fielding progressed in FY 96,  as  did  fielding  of Patriot  Advanced  Capability-3  (PAC- 3).  Direct downlink and delivery of  theater and national intelligence products in the› ater  to  the  tactical  commander  will  be  assw·ed  by THAAD. The  newly established Joint Aerostat Program  Management Office  is  assessing the applicability  of  lighter-than-air,  tethered  platforms  for  cruise  missile defense,  with  operational  assessments  occurring  at White  Sands, New Mexico. The first Joint Tactical Ground Station remains on schedule and is set for fielding in  FY 97.

Army support of  joint training, exercises, and military operations for theater missile defense resulted  in tbe Missile Defense Battle Integration Center (MDBTC) as theAnny's primary distributed interactive training for a synthetic battlefield. With MDBIC, soldiers solve tactical problems they would  confront in  combat in  a virtual, digitized, simulated environment, deploying threat missile systems on designated terrain  in anticipated light and  weather conditions. In  FY 96, during its  second year of demonstra› tions, the  MDBJC  supported  BruGHT  STAR,  ULCHI  Focus  LENS,  and PRAIRIE WARRIOR at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and ROVING SANDS at Fort Bliss,  Texas.  The  Force-Projection  Tactical  Operations  Center  (TOC), which provides the joint force  land component commander with  a com› mand and control  facility tailored for  theater missile defense, completed its second year of  successful operation.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

To  support  the  Army's changed  focus  from  forward  deployment  to power projection,  the  reserve  components  have  restructured and  reorga› nized along with the active Army. The Army Reserve has become primar› ily  a  support force, while  the Army National Guard provides the  bulk  of the reserve components' combat forces. The Reserve provides 45 percent of all  combat service support units  in  the Total Army;  30 percent of all combat support; 97 percent of  all  civil  affairs;  86 percent of all  psycho› logical operations; 70 percent of  all medical and chemical capability; and 100 percent of  all training and exercise divisions, railway units, and enemy POW brigades.

During the drawdown, the Reserve inactivated or transferred virtually all of its combat units, the majority of  its helicopter units, and a portion of its corps- and division-level combat support units to the Guard. In FY 96, the  Guard received  more  than  1  1  ,560  personnel  slots from the  Reserve and inactivated 229 units with 24,768 force structure spaces. From FY 95 to FY 96, the  Guard remained stabilized  at 8 combat divisions  while its separate  brigades  were  reduced  from  24  to  22.  In FY 97,  the  separate brigades  will  undergo  a  further  reduction  to  eighteen,  completing  the Guard's force reduction.

In FY 92, FORSCOM established the Contingency Force Pool (CFP) as a Total Army power-projection force that would deploy to crisis areas worldwide.  CFP I units  supported  active  Army  divisions  scheduled  to deploy first; CFP II units supported those scheduled to deploy later. Force packages were designed for each division, with CFP I  units  in packages numbered from  1 to 4 and CFP II units in packages from 5 to 7. CFP units were  designated  as  high  priority  and  received  additional  resources  to achieve greater readiness. The Guard's deployability rate  was 95  percent in October  1993  and  remained  higher than  that of the  Reserve and  the active Army until October I 994, when it fell  to  89 percent. In FY 94, 478 Reserve units and 368 Guard  units joined active Army units  in  the CFP, providing the capability to  deploy  up  to  2 corps headquarters and  8-2/3

active component divisions from CONUS bases. In November 1995, the Force Support Package (FSP) replaced the CFP.  Support for 4-1/3 divi› sions, one full  corps, and one theater slice (elements of  a theater army) is designated FSP I; support for one division, one partial corps, and one the› ater opening slice is designated FSP ll. Of the  1,116 FSP  units, 202 are the  highest  priority  units  in  the  Guard.  Eight  FSP  units  are  currently deployed to support peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.

As the size of  the active Army decreased, reserve components experi› enced a rise in  mission requirements and predicted a shortfall . in  combat support and combat service support units by 2003. In addition, the BUR and the National Military Strategy required highly trained and equipped, combat-ready reserve forces to support two major regional conflicts. As a result of the Army National  Guard Division Redesign Study in FY 96, twelve low-priority combat maneuver brigades will convert to higher-pri› ority suppott units, and two former combat divisions will convert to com› posite combat support/combat service support divisions, pending funding approval. The active Army and the Guard will develop a closer relation› ship under the AC/RC  (Active  Component/Reserve Component) Integrated Division Concept, which is part of  the Redesign Study. A com› posite active Army/Guard division will be formed-the active Army will supply the division headquarters and the Guard will supply three enhanced separate brigades. Following approval by the Secretary of  the Army, active Army personnel will be selected and assigned to the division.

The  enhanced separate brigades selected  to  be the principal reserve ground combat maneuver force are scheduled to be fully operational by FY 99 and are currently making the transition to the new design from their for› mer roles as roundout/roundup brigades, heavy separate brigade, armored cavalry  regiment,  and  separate  brigades.  Modernization  and  extensive training  are being conducted to ensure that they will  be compatible with active  Army  divisions.  By  30  September  1999,  all  enhanced  separate brigades are expected to achieve C- 1 readiness in personnel, equipment on hand, and equipment serviceability, and to attain C- 3 readiness in training.

Expectations for the enhanced separate brigades are high. The FY 96 Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan apportioned the brigades to  the  unified and  specified  commands.  In  April  1996,  the  enhanced  brigades  were placed on the Time-Phased Force Deployment List, which sets priorities for  unit  deployments  during  mobilization.  In  September  1996,  the  DA Alignment Study placed the separate brigades at the third-highest priority level on the DA Master Priority List, which sets a hierarchy for all Army units  according  to  the  "first-to-fight,  first-to-resource"  concept.  As  a result  of the  emphasis  placed  on  the  enhanced  separate  brigades,  the remainder of  the Guard's  strategic reserve combat forces will not be fully equipped or staffed.

The Summer 1996 Command Plan established force structure plans for the Reserve for FY 96 and beyond. The Reserve will provide augmen› tation forces  to the Icelandic Defense Forces and to the  122d Prisoner of War Information Center. In addition, the Reserve will  provide personnel to fill TDA positions at the Atlantic Intelligence Command. The plan also encompassed strategic military intelligence detachments and the realign› ment of  garrison support units (GSU).

To  provide  the Army  with  a greater power-projection capability, the Reserve established GSUs that can be  mobilized on the first day  of any contingency.  When active Army  units  deploy,  GSUs take  their place on active Army installations, ensuring that needed functions can be accom› plished. Three  GSVs were  activated  in  June  1996  to  support Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR.  GSUs can also provide assistance to active Army units during  peacetime  when  needed.  In  addition  to  forming  the  GSVs,  the Reserve  reorganized  its  port  and  terminal  units,  medical  augmentation hospitals,  movement control  units, and  replacement battalions and  com› panies to improve its support to the Total Army in time of  crisis.

MI support was redesigned significantly under the Reserve Component  Military  Intelligence  Force  Design  Update  95- l plan approved in  September  1996, with activation planned for FY 97. Active Army MI Force Projection Brigades have a regional focus, enabling them to  support power-projection  maneuver forces  aligned with  either  Major Regional Contingency East or West,  the two  regional contingencies that the  military  is  prepared  to  fight simultaneously.  Reserve  component MI units  at echelons above  division  will  be  reoriented  in the  same manner. The plan  calls  for two  reserve component MI groups aligned  to  active Army power-projection brigades, an  imagery analysis  battalion, and two technical  intelligence companies (the latter were  immediately aligned  to power-projection brigades  with global theater  support  missions). Modularization  will  ensure  that  only  needed  skills  are  mobilized.  The package oriented toward Major Regional  Contingency East includes the 505th Military Intelligence Group (East), the 345th Military Intelligence Battalion (Theater Operations) (East), and the 323d Military Intelligence Battalion  (Theater  Exploitation)  (East).  Scheduled  to  support  Major Regional Contingency West is  a  package containing the 295th  Military Intelligence  Group  (West), the 368th  Military  Intelligence  Battalion (Theater Operations) (West), and the 32lst Military Intelligence Battalion (Corps Support) (West).

The U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command, belonging to SOCOM, was not providing sufficient funding for unit opera› tions or training for one of  its subordinate units, the 1st  USAR Linguist Unit Reinforcement Training Unit. In October 1995, the linguist unit commander requested that the unit be realigned under the USAR Deputy Chief of  Staff

for  Intelligence.  In  December  1995,  SOCOM approved  the realignment. The unit's  linguistic skills would be used by the Reserve to support the Force Design Update as it pertained to MI linguist battalions and companies.

As DOD executive agent for NBC defense, the Army has developed what it considers the pillar of biological defense.  In September 1996, the 31 Oth Chemical  Company  (Biological  Integrated  Detection  System [BIDS]) was activated as a reserve unit at Fort McClellan, Alabama. The company, with four reserve platoons and one active Army platoon, will be assigned during wartime to  a chemical brigade or a Theater Army  Area Command chemical battalion for command and control. The BIDS com› pany mission is to provide early warning, detection, location, and  identi› fication of biological weapons in the  field. The company's 185  soldiers, who can be deployed in 35  point/detection teams,  will accomplish long› range, standoff  biological detection. An M31  positioned on a Hum  vee (the familiar  term for  the  High-Mobility,  Multipurpose  Wheeled  Vehicle [HMMWV]) is the primary detection equipmentit can detect a biologi› cal cloud and identify up to four different biological agents. An airborne detection  tool,  the  XM94  Long  Range  Biological  Standoff  Detection System,  is  mounted on  a  UH-60  Black Hawk.  The XM94 can provide early detection of biological weapon attacks and  has a range of thirty  to forty  kilometers.  Each  BIDS  company will  receive  three XM94 systems when fielding, which begins in FY 97, is complete.

The reorganization  of the  U.S.  Army Reserve  Command  (USARC) structure  for  command  and  control,  designed  to  improve  training  and mobilization of  reserve units, was a significant restructuring effort of  FY 96.  In  April 1996,  ten  regional  support  commands  (RSCs)  and  three regional  support  groups  (RSGs)  replaced  the  twenty  Army  Reserve Commands (ARCOMs)  located  in  CONUS.  Three ARCOMs remained outside  CONUS  (OCONUS)  in  Hawaii,  Puerto  Rico,  and  Germany. Eliminati . on  of  the ARCOMs reflects changes made by  the Reserve as  it developed into the Total Army's primary combat support and combat ser› vice support force.

USAR's  Office  of Installation  Management  and  Policy  (OIMP), established in November 1995, is the focal point for coordinating support and  resources  for  all  reserve  installations  and  Reserve  Forces  Training Areas (RFTAs). Two of  OIMP's first actions were the deactivation of  Fort Devens,  Massachusetts,  on  31 March J 996  and  the  activation  of the Devens  RFTA  on  1 April  1996.  Fort  McCoy,  Wisconsin,  acquired  the responsibility for  command  and  control  of  the  Devens  RFTA. In September  1996,  OIMP  gained  responsibility  for  all  reserve  issues  on installations scheduled for transfer to the Reserve.  Plans began immedi› ately to transfer Fort Dix,  New Jersey, and the Charles E.  Kelly  Support Facility,  Pennsylvania,  to  the  Reserve  for  command  and  control.  Next,

OIMP worked  to  extend  command and control from Fort Dix over the Charles E.  Kelly Support Facility and the Devens RFTA, and to deactivate Fort Pickett, Virginia.

The RSCs have acquired responsibility for installation management and base operations as the Reserve has assumed more of  the Army's mis› sion  for  those  functions.  RSCs are  located  in  Los Alamitos, California; Fort Totten, New York; Birmingham, Alabama; Fort Snelling, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; North Little Rock, Arkansas; Fort Devens, Massachusetts;  Fort  Douglas,  Utah;  Oakdale,  Pennsylvania;  and  Fort Lawton, Washington. The RSGs, located at Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana; and San Antonio, Texas, are designed to support RSCs with large unit populations.

Cw-rently, the Reserve currently manages seven installations previous› ly operated by the active Army and will acquire Fort Dix in FY 97. Fort Dix and Fort McCoy, an installation already managed by USAR, are two of  the Army's fifteen power-projection platforms, requiring significant attention to their infrastructure and support. In August 1996, USARC directed com› manders to use reserve installations for training, regardless of  other instal› lations available in their geographic area. In September 1996, the Reserve approved a realignment plan for the Devens RFTA. The 94th RSC, located at Fort Devens, would  provide regional support for  information manage› ment,  public  affairs,  food  service,  maintenance,  and  alcohol  and  drug abuse programs, while Fort Dix would provide other regional support.

BRAC  and  related  actions  remained  an  issue  during  FY  96.  The Reserve  received  DOD approval  to accept transfer of two  buildings  on Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, avoiding a $66.5 million lease and  received  final  approval  and  transfer of property  at  the  Dallas Naval  Air  Station,  Texas.  The  Orlando  Local  Reuse  Authority  (LRA) opposed  the  Reserve's efforts  to  acquire property at  the  Orlando  Naval Training Center,  Florida, except for one building that requires five  to  six million  dollars  for  renovation.  In  addition,  the  LRA  recommended  that state funds  be  used for  a joint Army,  Naval,  and Marine Corps Reserve project.  In Texas, the Reserve plans to build a new USAR Center at Red River Army Depot, where it received some properties that had been iden› tified as excess.  In  response to an  LRA request to declare a range at the Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Academy at the Darby USAR Center on Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, as excess, the Reserve conducted a study on consolidating NCO academies.

## Strength and Personnel Management

Since 1989, the number of  personnel in the reserve components has decreased 22 percent. The Army Reserve, with a 35 percent decline sched-

ulcd to occur until  the drawdown is complete in FY 98, has withstood the worst of  the reductions. Guard strength at the end of  FY 96 was 370,000; Reserve strength decreased to  226,200. The Reserve did  not  achieve  its end strength objective for officers or enlisted personnel in  FY 96 due to high attrition rates.

The Guard met 99.2 percent of its end strength objective for FY 96. Total  strength included  41,834 officers and  328,142 enlisted personnel. Although the attrition rate for officers, at 11.8 percent, was lower than iri previous  years,  officer  strength  was  below  the  programmed  objective. Officer accessions were 72.8 percent below the objective. Nonaviator war› rant officer authorizations were filled at 70.7 percent, creating a shortage in  technical specialties, while aviation warrant officer authorizations were filled  at  100  percent. Accession  of enlisted personnel was  98  percent of the programmed objective. Non-prior-service accessions met 95.1 percent of the objective and  consisted of 38.9 percent of total  accessions,  while prior service accessions  met 99.6 percent of that objective and provided 61.1  percent of total  accessions.  Quality  of accessions  was  maintained, with the exception that 82.3 percent of  enlistees, rather than the objective of95.5 percent, were high school diploma graduates. When enlistees with general equivalency diplomas  are  included,  100  percent of all  enlistees had a high school diploma. Non- prior service accessions declined in FY 96 due to  increased competition from the civilian job market, the govern› ment shutdown, and a public belief that the drawdown would lead to lim› ited opportunities in  the military.

Within  the  Guard,  both  minorities  and  women  were  concentrated within  the  lower  two-thirds  of the officer corps and  the enlisted corps. Minorities comprised 25.6  percent of assigned  strength (6.6  percent of officers and 16.8 percent of  enlisted personnel), representing a  l percent increase from FY 95. Continuing a decline that began in FY 88, however, the percentage of  African Americans dropped  1.5 percent, from  17.2 per› cent in  FY 95 to  15.7 percent in FY 96. Women in the Guard comprised 8.6  percent of assigned strength (8.3  percent of officers and  8.6 percent of  enlisted personnel), representing a small increase of 0.4 percent since FY 95.

A Reserve audit published in January  1996 revealed  that, to  reduce attrition  rates,  improvements  needed to be made in  managing  personnel strength, providing leadership, and caring for soldiers. Problems found in the audit included inconsistent realistic mission training, inadequate unit sponsorship programs, ineffective reenlistment interviews, and inadequate attention  paid  to  increasing  retention.  Audit  recommendations  focused primarily on acquiring and  training "additional duty  retention  NCOs"› personnel to whom the  unit commander gave the task,  additional to per› forming the functions of their primary MOS, of trying to  improve reten-

tion within the unit. In addition, the audit report suggested improvements for the sponsorship program and leader development.

The Guard developed a Recruiting and Retention Program for recruit› ing quality soldiers,  retaining  MOS-qualified soldiers, and reducing the loss offirst-term soldiers, and has implemented it across the nation.  In FY 96, the Guard's  "first line leader training" program reduced attrition 4 per› cent from the FY 95 level, retaining 15,000 soldiers and saving $800 mil› lion in  training costs. The retention program incorporated a new advertis› ing campaign that resulted in 49,000 commercials that reached 53.3 mil› lion persons in  the targeted age group.

A new tool for  improving retention, the Selective Reserve Incentive Program, was implemented in FY 96.  Non- prior service enlistees enter› ing  high-priority  units  received  a  $2,500 enlistment  bonus,  while  other non- prior service enlistees could elect to use the Student Loan Repayment Program  during their  initial  contract period if their loan did not exceed $10,000. The Civilian Acquired Skills Program offered a $5,000 bonus for all  enlistees.  In  addition, the Reserve offered a $2,500 bonus for soldiers who reenlisted or extended their tours.

In  May  1996, the Reserve gained another useful personnel capability when the Reserve Associate Support Program was approved. Selected sol› diers would complete initial  training, serve a  mandatory two-year active duty tour in  an  active Army unit, and then return to  their Force Support Package units as drilling reservists to complete their four-year obligation. The program would provide the high-priority Force Support Package units with highly trained and experienced soldiers.

The first  major  legislation  to  affect reserve commissioned  officers since  1954 is the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA), wltich will be effective I October 1996. In preparation, the Reserve estab› lished a system to train  individuals  who will implement and manage the legislation. The intent ofROPMA was to modernize statutes, provide uni› formity across the services and between the reserve and active forces, and streamline reserve officer personnel actions. With ROPMA, officers must be best qualified, in  addition to fully qualified, for promotion to the next higher  grade.  Time-in-service  requirements  have  been  eliminated,  and majors  selected  for  promotion  to  lieutenant  colonel  no  longer  require Senate confirmation. Lieutenants serving in a  captain's position will  not be eligible for accelerated promotion, although second lieutenants can be promoted  with  twenty-four  months  in grade.  Above  the  rank of major, officers will  need  three years  in grade to retire at that rank unless forced out of the service for maximum years of  commissioned service or age, in which case the time-in-grade requirement will be six months. Lieutenant colonels  must  separate  after  28  years  of commissioned  service  and colonels after 30; the  provision  for colonels  to  be  able to  remain  for  5

years in their grade position was eliminated. Officers below the grade of lieutenant colonel who are twice not selected for promotion will be sepa› rated. In FY 96, USAR's DCSPER prepared to eliminate reservists under the new ROPMA rules.

A policy on early retirement eligibility appeared in FY 96 for disabled members of  the Selected Reserve. A soldier who requested transfer to the Retired  Reserve due to  medical  disqualifications that prevented  further active duty service would  be eligible for early retirement and, therefore, receipt of  retired pay at age sixty, under certain conditions. The transfer to the Retired  Reserve must  occur  between  5  October 1996  and  30 September 1999, and the soldier must have accumulated between fifteen and twenty years of  qualifying service. The soldier cannot be eligible for immediate  military  disability  retirement  and  cannot  have  intentionally caused the disability.

In May 1996, the Reserve changed its personnel management system from one based on branch and functional areas to a regional team organi› zation.  The teams  provide  total  lifecycle career management support to soldiers,  help  the RSCs  to support soldiers in  a responsive manner,  and support  the  RSCs  in maintaining  unit  readiness. Simultaneously,  the Reserve  consolidated  personnel  functions in the new  ARPERSCOM located  in  St. Louis,  Missouri,  scheduled  to  replace  ARPERCEN  in October  1997. In preparation  for  becoming  a personnel command, ARPERCEN implemented the personnel electronic record  management system, an efficient system that creates electronic documents from paper and  microfiche and  permits instantaneous access to  records  by  multiple users.  The conversion is 96 percent complete and  will  be operational  in January  1997. The Reserve  reduced costs, improved accountability, and reduced staff  by combining all civilian pay operations in one location and reducing military pay operations from six centers to three.

The Army Reserve recognizes that contented family members are cru› cial  in  retaining  military members. In 1996, USAR conducted  fourteen Regional  Family  Program  Academies,  or workshops,  for  2,600  partici› pants, training volunteers, unit full-time personnel, and leaders on family readiness.  Each  RSC  and  the  65th  ARCOM  conducted  one  academy, while the 88th RSC conducted three academies. In addition, USAR sol› diers  attended DA  Family Team Building  classes  and  returned  to  their installation to implement training for family members. A training program of forty-one  classes,  designed  to  develop  self-reliant  family  members, covered  basic  military terms  and  customs, discussed  community resources, and taught problem-solving techniques.

Complaints to the USAR Inspector General (IG) persisted in the areas of personnel  management,  finance  and  accounting,  personal  conduct, training  management, and command management of operations.  Of the

881  allegations  made in  FY  96 of fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanage› ment,  333 were  unsubstantiated.  Inspector  General  Action  Requests (!GAR), totaling 3,214, declined by  10 percent from the previous year but remained twice as  high as the  number executed  in  FY 94. The National Guard IG handled over 5,600 cases in FY 96, the majority of  which were in  tbe  same categories  as  Reserve  cases.  The  Guard  IG also  conducted general inspections of  the 91 st Division (Exercise) and the 1  08th Division (Training) and completed  general inspections of  six commands. Unsatisfactory ratings were given to inventory, property book, and hand› receipt procedures, and  to 40  percent of the commands for NBC equip› ment. The IG also assessed various training areas as inadequate and noted concern about the management of  evaluation reports, personnel qualifica› tion records, weight control, and maintenance.

## Training and Readiness

The  tiered resourcing  methodology  of  "first-to-fight,  first-to› resource," initiated in  1994 in response to declining resources, resulted in congressional authorization  for  more full-time support personnel for the first-to-deploy  FSP  units  and  enhanced  separate  brigades.  The Reserve Component Active  Guard/Reserve  (AGR)  program permits  trained  and experienced soldiers from the active Army and its reserve components to apply for active duty or full-time positions in the National Guard or  Army Reserve. The intent of  the AGR program is to provide highly trained offi› cers and  enlisted  personnel  to organize, administer, recruit,  instruct, and train  selected  reserve  units  and  personnel.  The  Army's AGR  program offers  opportunities  for  career development  and  upward  mobility,  thus encouraging retention, since AGR soldiers are eligible for the same bene› fits as their active Army counterparts. In FY 96, 23,045 AGR soldiers and 25,541  military  technicians were assigned as full-time support personnel in  the  Guard,  increasing the  readiness  level of  the  FSP  22  percent over J 994. A total of II ,575 AGR soldiers and 4,540 military technicians were serving full  time  in  the  USAR in FY 96. Although the Reserve received the  lowest level  of  full-time support of the reserve components, approxi› mately 70 percent of its units were rated as ready for war.

As the nation emphasized partial mobilization planning instead of  full mobilization, the Reserve no  longer needed to provide initial  entry train› ing  for  huge  numbers of soldiers  upon  mobilization,  but  it  did  need  to increase its capability for  unit training. The Total Army Training System (TATS), devised in  FY  94 to  provide uniformity in  training Reserve and active Army soldiers, resulted in a reorganization ofUSAR training divi› sions  into  divisions  (institutional  training)  (DMT) and  divisions  (exer› cise)  (DIVEX).  The  DJVlTs  manage  individual  training  within  a  geo-

graphic area,  including initial  entry training, MOS reclassification train› ing, and refresher training for  members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).  Specialized  training  brigades  and  battalions  in  the  DIVITs  are formed  from  USAR  Forces  Schools,  which  were  previously  part  of ARCOMs. Several DIVITs will be in  place in FY 97. The DIVEXs pro› vide training for combat support and combat service support units of the Guard  and  Reserve,  conduct CPXs  for headquarters  units,  and conduct FTXs ("lanes" training) for subordinate units.  Supporting lanes and sim› ulation  training  is  a  cornerstone  of Reserve participation  in  TATS.  The ground forces  readiness enhancement program, also an element ofTATS, established a plan for all DlVEXs, RSCs, functional commands, and sub› ordinate  commands  to  train  with  the  active  Army  on  premobilization, postmobilization, and collective tasks.

The Army National Guard executed a  major training initiative during Annual  Training  96,  supporting  FORSCOM  lanes  training  for  enhanced separate brigades with divisional units. Guard  divisional units from California's  40th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and Kansas'  35th Jnfantry Division (Mechanized) served as opposing forces in training Oregon's  41st Separate Infantry Brigade and Washington's  81 st Separate Infantry Brigade. The Guard and Reserve also participated  in  numerous exercises  overseas and within CONUS to enhance their tl-aining and readiness levels.

In Exercise RIFLES  MovE,  the  Reserve planned and executed  trans› portation support to move the 3dArmored Cavalry from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Fort Carson, Colorado, relieving active Army transportation assets from the responsibility while simultaneously accomplishing useful training. For the first time, Reserve units were completely responsible for convoy oper› ations; additionally, they assisted in rail loading at Fort Bliss. The Reserve established a trailer transfer point in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and convoyed 850 loads of cargo from  Fort Bliss to Santa Fe, and  then  to  Fort Carson. Three thousand soldiers participated in this exercise, used by battalion and higher headquarters to conduct unit training under operational conditions.

The transition  to  the  Guard's new promotion policySelect, Train, Promote, Assignneared completion in FY 96.  Scheduled  to be  opera› tional  in  January  1997, the  program will  ensure that only  those enlisted soldiers on a promotion list for a current or projected vacancy will receive training for that grade level. The Reserve bas established priorities for  its professional development education budget to fund FSP and CONUS sup› port base units at I  00 percent, to fund DIVEXs and second priority units at 90  percent, and  to  provide  the  remaining  funds  and unfilled  training allocations to the rest of  the units. Training funds for IMAs and members of  the IRR are expended as available. In FY 96, obtaining individual train› ing  allocations  for  non- prior service  enlisted  personnel  remained diffi› cult, though the situation had improved.

The TASS was implemented fully  in FY 96 as former state military academies became TASS training brigades and were subsequently redes› ignated. Following a year of  transition, lessons learned from the prototype TASS  region  will  be  applied  to  the  other  six TASS  regions. In 1996, FORSCOM examined the possibility of a  centralized language training contract.  If such  a contract is established, Reserve units can discontinue contracting individually for language training at hlgh cost, and can ensure that training will be received. The  Guard  Video  Teleconferencing Command and  Control  Network  was  operational,  with  connections  in place  for  all  STARCs,  six  enhanced  brigades,  and the  National  Guard Readiness  Center.  In  FY  97,  connections  to  the  remaining  enhanced brigades and  to  Alaska,  Guam,  Puerto Rico,  and  the Virgin  Islands are expected  to  be  completed,  providing  a  command  and  control  network between  commanders  and  STARCs,  as  well  as  between  the  Readiness Center  and  state  headquarters.  The  Guard  also  expanded  its  Regional Distance Learning Network in FY 96, with nine prototype classrooms cur› rently  operational  in Delaware,  the  District  of Columbia,  Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia. The Guard's plans to establish these classrooms in all states and territories are being executed.

## Mobilization

Every year, approximately 20,000 Army Reserve soldiers deploy to 50 countries to support military operations. In the last decade, the percentage of the Reserve's soldiers  mobilized  in support of  Total Army  operations has increased, while that of  the Guard's bas decreased.

During Operations DESERT SHIELD  and DESERT STORM,  35 percent of the Army's reserve component forces were Reserve, while the proportion during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY reached 70 percent. The latter per› centage has held constantin Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, Anny reservists comprise 67 percent of  the reserve forces. Additionally, more than 25,240 Guard soldiers deployed overseas during FY 96 for operations missions in support of combatant commands or UN peacekeeping forces, to provide nation-building assistance, and to participate in training exercises.

The Presidential  Selected  Reserve Call-up on 8  December  1995,  in response  to  ethnic  strife in  Bosnia,  mobilized  members  of the  Selected Reserve for  the  third  time in  five  years. A  mobilization of  2,087 Guard soldiers from 28 states and 53 units supported JoiNT ENDEAVOR. The first Guard units began deploying on 14 December 1995 and arrived in theater on  24 December  1995.  Guard  personnel  numbered  994  military police mobilized in 8 companies; 414 soldiers from 2 nondivisional, direct sup› port maintenance companies; and 116 personnel in 9 public affairs detach› ments.  Other Guard soldiers were mobilized from aviation command and

control elements, an SF command and control element, field artillery fire support batteries, target acquisition batteries, and combat arms command and  control  elements.  Military  police  command  and  control  elements, movement control detachments, and a logistics support element also sent Guard soldiers on the deployment. The remaining Guard soldiers arrived in  the  European theater as part  of a  finance  battalion,  adjutant general detachments, military history detachments, linguist units, and other TDA support elements.

The Army Reserve mobilized 2,799 soldiers from  104 units in FY 96 for JOINT ENDEAVOR in 2 nonmedical and 3 medical rotations. Reserve sol› diers  operated  mobilization  stations  at  Fort  Benning,  Georgia,  and  Fort Dix, New Jersey.  In  addition,  some  reservists  deployed  to  Germany  to backfill  active  Army  units  sent  to  Bosnia,  while  others  deployed  to Hungary to assist in USAREUR  's forward operations. The Reserve is pro› viding the major portion of  the medical support for the sustaining base as well as operating the joint information  bureau  in  Bosnia.  Reservists  in Bosnia have published a multilingual newspaper to inform civilians on the peace treaty, land mines, and other subjects. A mobilization in May 1996 was  designed  specifically  to  assist  in  nation  building.  Units  removed mines from  the area, improved the road and rail  network, accomplished some construction, improved the water quality, and strengthened military authority. A third nonmedical mobilization is expected to arrive in theater in December 1996.

In January  1996, the Army  Reserve sent fourteen legal support sol› diers with expertise in administrative law,  criminal  law,  legal  assistance, tax return  preparation,  contract  law, claims,  and  operational  law  to European commands and Bosnia. In addition, legal support was given to the two mobilization stations at Fort Be1ming and Fort Dix. In May 1996, another  twenty-nine  legal  support  soldiers,  virtually  all  of them  judge advocates, were deployed to Germany, Belgium, Hungary, and Bosnia.

The public affairs  units  that deployed in December  1995  to  Bosnia returned  in  July  1996. The  units  mobilized  consisted  of mobile  public affairs detachments, a  broadcast public affairs detachment, a press camp headquarters, and a public affairs detachment. They established broadcast and radio support to troops, supplied maneuver brigade commanders with public affairs  support, and accommodated news media requests to  travel with or visit reserve units  in theater.  In  June  1996, additional  units were mobilized to perform similar duties and operate Bosnia's  media operations center.

The  military  had  a  critical  need  during JOINT  ENDEAVOR  for  Serbo› Croatian  linguists,  but  the Reserve  had  only  thirty  in  its  inventory.  The 272d Military Intelligence Company (Linguist), activated in October 1995, was  mobilized  in  March  1996  with  twelve  Serbo-Croatian linguists and

eleven volunteers from  other units. In  addition, twelve counterintelligence soldiers deployed with the unit. The linguists were given a four-week train› ing course in Serbo-Croatian and then sent to Bosnia, while the counterin› telligence soldiers were deployed to Italy and England. In June  1996, the Reserve sent 28 MI soldiers to  support the USAREUR Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence in  Heidelberg as backfill and, in July  1996,  108 MI soldiers to the 66th Military Intelligence Group in Augsburg as backfill.

Nonmedical personnel were mobilized for 270 days; medical person› nel,  however,  were  mobilized  for  140 days,  although  they  could  extend their tours to 270 days.  Mobilized medical personnel who replaced their active  Army  counterparts  included OB-GYN  doctors,  pediatricians, internists, medical and surgical nurses, optometrists, and medical logistics specialists.  The  first  medical  rotation  occurred in  December  1995  with 362 soldiers assigned from Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Massachusetts, and Colorado. In April  1996,  the  second rotation took  place, including 360 soldiers (of  whom 88 had extended their tour from the first rotation) from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota,  Ohio, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Kansas.  USAR's mission at the end of  April was to backfill medical units at mobilization stations. The third rotation, in August 1996, contained 334 persons (of whom 77  had extended their tour from  the second  rotation) from California, Kansas,  Hawaii, and Germany.  Medical personnel  were also  sent  to  numerous  locations  in  Germany  to  backfill  medical  staff deployed to Bosnia.

Reserve soldiers supported other operations at the same time as JoiNT ENDEAVOR. On 8 January 1996, the Reserve was ordered to deploy soldiers and  equipment for  179 days  to support Eighth U.S. Army, Korea. Three mission aircraft, a ground intercept facility, aU  supporting equipment, and personnel skilled in  intelligence collection and direc6on finding deployed between 17 January and 7 February. The unit redeployed on 21 April  1996.

A  vitally important  Army  National  Guard  effort  is its State Partnership  Program.  Countries  with  newly  emerging  democracies  are partnered with  U.S.  states in  an effort to develop long-term relationships and assist in  the development of democratic militaries. States host famil› iarization tours of government facilities  for  their partner countries; state governors visit partner countries in  return. Guard soldiers serve as chiefs or deputies of  U.S.  Military Liaison Teams in thirteen host countries, orig› inally only in the Baltic States, and work with ministries of  defense. Guard soldiers participate in Traveling Contact Teams in  partner countries, pro› viding  information on military operations such as air search and  rescue, medical  evacuation,  civil  emergencies,  and  natural  disasters.  The  teams also discuss military issues such as personnel, budgeting, administration, military Jaw, professional military education, family programs, recruiting, retention, reserve forces training, and mobilization.

In  FY  96,  the  State  Partnership  Program  expanded  to  encompass Central and South America when Missouri-Panama and Louisiana-Belize were approved for partnerships; thirty-two soldiers will deploy to the host countries.  Proposed  partnerships  between  Kentucky-Ecuador  and  West Virginia- Peru were approved by SOUTHCOM. African and Asian nations have also expressed interest in participating. Other state partnerships are: Alabama-Romania,  Arizona-Kazakhstan,  California-Ukraine,  Colorado› Slovenia, Georgia- Republic of  Georgia, Illinois-Poland, Indiana› Slovakia,  Louisiana-Uzbekistan,  Maryland-Estonia,  Michigan-Latvia, Minnesota-Croatia,  Montana-Kyrgyzstan,  Nevada-Turkmenistan,  North Carolina- Moldova, Ohio-Hungary, Pennsylvania-Lithuania, South Carolina- Albania,  Tennessee-Bulgaria,  Texas-Czech Republic, Utah› Belarus,  and Vermont-Macedonia.  In  support  of the  State  Partnership Program,  390  Guard  soldiers  deployed  to  all  of the  partner  countries except for Croatia. In summer 1996, Indiana and Alabama Guard person› nel  participated  in  Exercise  CORNERSTONE  96  in  Romania,  where  they rehabilitated a  military  hospital,  an international day care center, and an orphanage.  Maryland,  Pennsylvania,  and Michigan  Guard  soldiers deployed  to  Latvia  and  participated  in  Exercise BALTIC  CHALLENGE. Several  states  participated  in  an  earthquake-preparedness  exercise  in Macedonia.

Guard personnel  also  participated in three company-size exchanges with the United Kingdom and Germany, in  which training and familiar› ization with each nation's military doctrine and tactics were conducted. In addition,  thirteen  Guard  officers  went  to the United  Kingdom  and Germany  for  their  annual  training,  while  thirteen foreign officers deployed to the United States. The Minnesota Guard participated in a win› ter warfare operations  exercise  and  a  company-size  exchange  with the Norwegian National Guard.

In  the  SOUTHCOM region,  the Guard supplied 600 soldiers  to  the Theater  and  Equipment  Maintenance  Site  for  organizational  and  direct support maintenance. In addition,  1,380 maintenance, logistics, and med› ical  personnel  supported  Guard  and  JCS  exercises,  as  well  as  RETRO Panama, the program to return equipment to CONUS as the United States prepares to leave Panama. Guard soldiers conducted nation-building assis› tance in Panama, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Belize and conducted med› ical readiness training in Panama, Belize, and Ecuador. Two hundred med› ical  personnel deployed  to  SOUTHCOM to  provide medical and dental care and to teach preventive medicine to the local populace. Four hundred SF soldiers trained  in  Belize, Bolivia,  Colombia,  Ecuador,  El  Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Suriname as part of  the Joint Combined Exercise Training. An additional 650 soldiers deployed to the JOTC in Panama for training.  The  Puerto  Rican  National  Guard  sent  500  soldiers  to  the

Dominican  Republic,  Jamaica,  and  Barbados  as  part  of  the Latin American Co-op Exchange Program.

Worldwide, the Guard deployed 6,250 soldiers for humanitarian and civic assistance projects that resulted  in  the construction or renovation of 25  schools,  8  community centers,  12  water wells,  37  kilometers  of farm-to-market  roads,  and  6  kitchen/dining facilities.  The Texas  Army National  Guard  provided  CH-470 aircraft support and  training to  the Republic  of  Singapore  Air  Force.  A  total  of 2,522  military  police deployed to all theaters to provide force protection, installation security, and law enforcement.

## Reserve Component Support to Civil Authorities

The Army National Guard and Army Reserve provide crucial support to law enforcement agencies, particularly in counterdrug activities.  With fielding of the  Reconnaissance and Interdiction Detachment (RAID) air› craft  to  Maine,  Maryland,  New Jersey,  West Virginia,  and  Vermont,  3  J detachments with 76 aircraft now exist in 31  states, and fielding is com› plete. The RAID aircraft  provides law enforcement agencies with a tool for  aerial  counterdrug surveillance at  night. The airborne platform con› sists of  a modified OIJ- 58A  + helicopter (an improved OH- 58A) with for› ward-looking  infrared  radar,  searchlights,  and  communications  that  are compatible with law  enforcement agencies. The Guard is retaining forty OH- 58 aircraft out of the Aviation  Restructuring Initiative to  assist law enforcement agencies in marijuana eradication.

Guard aviation supported the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and responded to domestic emergencies such as earthquakes, floods, and fires. The Guard flew 310,000 hours during FY 96, including deployments and operations overseas, but experienced zero Class A flight accidents, the lowest Class A accident rate  in  the history of military aviation. The acci› dent rate  is  even  more  remarkable  considering the operational  missions, the tactical and night vision goggle training,  the disaster relief missions, and the counterdrug support missions that were flown.

The Guard conducted several programs in FY 96 for American youth. ChalleNGe,  a  five-month  residential  program  for  16to 18-year-old drug-free high school dropouts without police records, graduated its sev› enth class with a 79 percent graduation rate, as opposed to the 55 percent rate in the program's first year.  Fifteen states currently participate in  this program that enables at-risk youths to complete a high school equivalen› cy diploma. STARBASE  (Science and Technology Academies Reinforcing Basic Aviation and Space Exploration)  is a Guard program designed  to  expose  urban  students  and  teachers  to  math  applications through  projects,  simulations,  and  experiments in aviation  and  space-

related fields. In FY 96, California, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto  Rico, South  Dakota, Texas, Vermont,  and  Wyoming  participated  in  STARBASE.  During  FY  96, Puerto  Rico  joined  Colorado,  Oregon,  and  Wisconsin  in  offering  the Youth  Conservation  Corps,  a  Guard  program  in  which  cadets  work  on federal and state projects.

## Equipment and Maintenance

With  procurement  and  modernization  funds  decreasing,  the  Army Reserve has worked hard to improve the status of its equipment on band. Depot maintenance programs are modernizing and improving equipment as well as extending service lif e in an effort to stretch funds.  Current pro› grams include U-21 aircraft modernization, generator conversions, trailer conversions,  computer upgrades,  trailer and  tanker  modernizations,  and wheeled vehicle remodeling.  In  addition,  the Reserve is  placing greater reliance on civilian  industry to maintain, repair, and remanufacture equip› ment. The Reserve is also  pursuing leasing programs for vehicles, man› agement of  satellite maintenance garages, maintenance of  vehicles stored for deployment, and vehicle maintenance.

The Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, in conjunc› tion with the Army Reserve, is managing a depot maintenance rebuild and rewarranty  program  for  all  D7F  bulldozers.  Caterpillar,  the  bulldozer manufacturer,  is inspecting, repairing,  and returning each bulldozer with new  warranties through its dealers.  Dealers within 200 miles of reserve units will retain responsibility to service the equipment. Caterpillar is also rebuilding rough terrain container handlers. It is  replacing all hoses  and many  electrical  components;  performing  sixteen  product  updates  to improve performance, dependability, and service lif e; and installing new copper bond main and connecting  rod  bearings  in the  engine to  reduce problems resulting from extended storage.

Under  an  extended  service  program,  AM  General  Corporation  is remanufacturing  one-third  of the  Reserve's 2 1 12-ton  trucks,  producing improved,  safer, and more  reliable  vehicles with  a f ifteen-year  lif e expectancy. AM General disassembles the trucks, rebuilds usable compo› nents, and replaces  obsolete components. Remanufactured trucks have a more powerful and efficient turbo diesel engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, and radial tires with central tire inflation. The Guard funded an  extended  service program  to  achieve  the  same  improvements  for  its 2 12-ton trucks and initiated a similar program for 5-ton trucks that would 1 include  remanufacture  and  an  improved  hauling  capability.  The  Texas National  Guard,  working  with  AM  General,  rebuilt  68  2  1 21 and  5-ton trucks for $38,000 each, saving $20,000 per vehicle, and is now produc-

ing a  kit  for  soldiers so  that upgrades  can  be accomplished  less expen› sively at home stations.

In  the  RETROEUR  program  (European  Retrograde  of Equipment), excess Army equipment from the European drawdown of  forces was sent for repair to a variety of  sites. Wheeled vehicles were repaired in Santa Fe, New Mexico;  wheeled  and  track equipment  at Fort Riley,  Kansas,  and  Camp Shelby, Kansas; engineer and wheeled equipment in Piketon, Ohio; M3A2 Bradley and wheeled vehicles at Fo11 Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania; com› munications-electronics  equipment  at  Camp  Withycomb,  Oregon;  and non- rolljJ,g stock equipment in Grass Station, Kentucky. At the repair sites, 75 percent of  the employees were Guard soldiers, while the remainder were civilians. By the end ofFY 96, RETROEUR sites had received 8,750 vehi› cles,  including MlA2 tanks,  Ml13 armored perso1mel carriers, M88 tank recovery vehicles, Humvees, and 5-ton trucks. They repaired 5,021 vehicles and  redistributed them  to Army organizations. A total of 17,005 pieces of communications-electronics equipment had been received, of  which 6,227 pieces were repaiJ·ed and redish·ibuted.

Within the Army National  Guard, aviation assets are  being modern› ized. UH- lH aircraft with new Comanche engines will be fielded to Light Utility  Helicopter Battalions. Predicted shortages ofUH- 60 Black Hawk helicopters  will  affect  the  Guard's medevac  capability.  ln  FY  96,  the Guard  received 413 aircraft from  the production line,  the  refurbishment program, and the Reserve. As the Guard acquired more modern systems, it  retired 397 of  its oldest aircraft.

Table 12 indicates equipment that was fielded to the Guard in FY 96 and the  number of personnel  who  received appropriate training on each system.

Even as  the  Reserve  increased  leases  pertaining  to  equipment and maintenance, it established a  lease  reduction plan for facilities.  In addi-

tion,  the Reserve made great strides toward reducing the number of gov› ernment facilities  it operated and maintained, saving $I J  million  that  it applied to facility  repair and  maintenance. In a  USAR review,  59 Jeased facilities  with  operational and maintenance costs of approximately $240 million were determined to be excess. In addition, 27 government-owned facilities  costing approximately  $73 1 million  were  identified  as  excess and could be disposed of  between FY 96 and FY 00.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

Following  Operation DESER T ST ORM,  DOD  identified  requirements necessary to mobilize and deploy military force to support the National Military  Strategy.  The  resulting 1992  Mobility  Requirements  Study (MRS)  and  1995  Bottom-Up  Review  Update  (BURU)  delineated  the areas  for which resources needed to  be obtainedstrategic airlift capa› bility, strategic  sealift  capability,  pre-positioned  equipment,  and  the transportation infrastructure. The Army must be capable of  deploying and sustaining active and reserve component units worldwide and relies upon the Air Force and Navy for strategic airlift and sealift. To improve strate› gic airlift capability as recommended by the study, the Air Force request› ed 120 C- 17 aircraft. By the end of  FY 96, twenty-seven C- l7s had been delivered.

To  meet the MRS/BURU  recommendation  that  the  Ready  Reserve Fleet maintain trurty-six roll-on/roll-off  ships, DOD planned to convert or build  19  large  medium-speed  roll-on/roll-off {LMSR) ships through FY 01  by converting 5 container ships and constructing 14 new ships. Eleven of these  ships will  go  into  the  Ready  Reserve Fleet with  the  remaining eight  scheduled  for  pre-positioning  equipment  afloat.  Two  conversion ships were delivered to the Navy in FY 96 and two additional conversion LMSRs are budgeted for FY 98. Contracts or options to build/convert the remaining  fifteen  LMSRs  have  been  let  and  will  increase  the  Ready Reserve Fleet to thirty-one roll-on/roll-off ships. No additional fundmg is planned to increase the number ofroll-on/roll-offships to thirty-six as rec› ommended  by  the  study.  The  Transportation  Command,  however,  is preparing a strategy to reduce the effects of  the shortfall.

The converted LMSRs will be named for Army soldiers awarded the Medal of  Honor; the first two vessels were delivered to the Navy in FY 96.  USNS Shughart, named after Sfc.  Randall  D.  Shughart,  was dedi› cated  13  April,  while  USNS Gordon, in  honor  of M.  Sgt.  Gary I. Gordon, was commissioned on 4 July. On 3 October 1993, both men vol› unteered to be inserted to protect four wounded personnel from  intense

hostile fire at a  helicopter crash site  in  Mogadishu, Somalia. After they established  a  perimeter  and  killed  numerous  attackers,  Shughart  was killed and  then  Gordon when their ammunition was depleted; the heli› copter pilot's life was saved.

The MRS/BURU also recommended that the equipment for an Army armored brigade be pre-positioned afloat.  Currently,  the Army  has four› teen ships to  support this pre-positioned afloat requirement.  Eight of the converted or new LMSRs will be designated for the pre-positioned afloat fleet. These vessels will carry equipment for an armored brigade and thir› ty-eight days of  supplies for Army units. In FY 97, USNS Gordon will be the first LMSR to  receive pre-positioned afloat equipment. Two  LMSRs being delivered  in  FY 98  will  replace  smaller  ships  carrying  pre-posi› tioned equipment.

The  Army  implemented  MRS/BURU  with  its  Army  Strategic Mobility Plan, which provides objectives specified in days from notifica› tion of  deployment to the formation of  a combat force  in the area of  oper› ationsa unit with its equipment, personnel, supplies, and logistical sup› port formed and ready to fight. Within four days of  notification, the Army is  prepared  to  deploy and  sustain  a  light  or airborne  brigade;  within  six days,  the  Army  expects  to  move  a  heavy  brigade  to  its  pre-positioned equipment on land. Twelve days after notification, the Army will be able to project and sustain a light or airborne division. A heavy brigade will be moved to  its pre-positioned afloat equipment within fifteen days of noti› fication and,  at thirty days,  two  heavy divisions  and their corresponding corps support can be deployed and supported.  By seventy-five days after notification, the Army  will  be able to  deploy and sustain a five-division contingency force and supporting elements.

To enable a rapid projection of  combat forces, the Army has pre-posi› tioned seven armored brigade sets of  equipment overseas, on land and at sea. To sustain the forces until sea lines of  communication are established, divisional, combat support, and combat service support equipment have also been  pre-positioned in the same  locations.  Army  Pre-position Stocks-4 (APS-4), the equipment pre-positioned in the Pacific, includes a brigade set of equipment, sustainment supplies, and operational equip› ment and supplies. Beginning in March 1995, the Army began to pre-posi› tion a  brigade set of  equipment for two armor battalions and one mecha› nized  infantry battalion at Camp  Carroll, Korea. Excess equipment was sent from CONUS, Europe, and elsewhere in Korea from unit drawdowns and stored equipment. In FY 95, only 8 percent of  the required equipment was present; by FY 96, this had reached 78 percent and was scheduled to reach  90  percent  in  FY  98.  The APS-4  brigade  will  provide  the  third armored brigade for the 2d Infantry Division, which can be manned rapid› ly by soldiers airlifted from  CONUS.

As  with  the rest of the Army,  logisticians  in  FY 96  focused  on  the Army's transition  to  Force  XXI,  in  which  smaller  forces  with  greater lethality will maneuver rapidly on the battlefield. A major redesign effort for combat service support and a new battlefield distribution concept were developed for  experimentation  during the  AWE  in  March  1997.  Future combat service support organizations  will  be centralized  at the  brigade level,  deploying  multifunctional  forward-support  companies  to  support maneuver battalions. In addition, Army logistics concentrated on applying information technologies such as total asset visibility, electronic technical manuals, radio frequency tags and  interrogators,  laser optical  cards, tur› bine engine  diagnostics,  telemedicine,  driver vision  enhancements,  and satellite tracking systems.  During Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR , total asset visibility allowed the tracking of  shipping containers and their contents to and within Bosnia, enabling Army logisticians to locate supplies, monitor cargo, and divert shipments, enhancing logistical support.

The Army's velocity management plan was developed to deliver sup› plies to units and soldiers in a timely manner and to meet or surpass deliv› ery  schedules  of the  best  commercial  firms.  The  Defense  Logistics Agency supported the Army's velocity management plan by guaranteeing deliveries on the dates and at the times requested  by direct support units and  by  using vendors to  deliver supplies and equipment directly to units. By  being able to  plan  when  deliveries  will  be  received  and  processed, units  were better able to  schedule the remainder of their daily  activities. Velocity management has reduced administrative processing time, deliv› ered supplies to  w1its  more  rapidly, and reduced  costs of  stocking  large numbers of items. AMC members are continuing to identify new opera› tions that can be improved or eliminated.

ODCSLOG announced an objective to digitize and electronically pub› lish  all  Army equipment publications.  In  FY 96, the Army fielded  elec› tronic field manuals on compact disk to the 3d and 4th Infantry Divisions (Mechanized), corps units, the NTC battalion, and the 728th Maintenance Company  (USAR).  The  next  initiative  includes  publishing  and  imple› menting  the  interactive  electronic  technical  manual  strategic  plan.  The manual, which uses diagnostic aids driven by software, will provide accu› rate prognoses, eliminate diagnostic errors, guide soldiers through repair procedures, and automate parts requisitions.  A  prototype manual was in use in FY 96 at Fort Stewart, Georgia, in an effort to automate motor pool functions  by  integrating the  interactive electronic technical  manual  with standard information management systems.

Within  the  Army  Operations  Center  in  the  Pentagon,  the  24-hour emergency  response  organization,  ODCSLOG  created  a Logistics Operations  Center.  The  Logistics  Operations  Center  supplied  logistics support to the Army Operations Center, operated as the DCSLOG's orga-

nizational representative, and contributed personnel to the crisis response cells or crisis action teams within the Army Operations Center. In FY 96, the Logistics Operations Center was activated to provide deployment sup› port for Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR.

## Maintenance

From their original role of  developing and maintaining weapons and equipment, Army depot facilities evolved into facilities for rebuilding, as well as maintaining, weapons and equipment. As private defense indus› tries became the major developers and producers of  military systems and equipment,  the number of Army  depots  declined.  In FY 97,  when  the BRAC 93 recommendations will be carried out, the Army depot system will  consist  of only  five  maintenance  depots  and  eight  ammunition plants.  Moreover,  the  decreasing  defense  budget  and  the  subsequent decline in military procurement have resulted in the private sector assum› ing much of  the rebuild and overhaul work previously performed only in depot facilities.

The Army's strategic maintenance sustainment base consists of  depot maintenance, which is the Anny's only source for fully  reconditioned or overhauled  end  items of equipment.  For 25  percent  of the  cost of new equipment, the Army can rebuild or repair end items to fill shortages, pro› vide modernization, and ensure readiness. Unfortunately, the depot main› tenance requirement is not always completely funded. In FY 96, the Army required $934.5 million for depot maintenance but received only $730.8 million. This 77 percent funding rate left $203.7 million of requirements unfunded.

In  another  effort  to  reduce  costs,  the  Army  developed  Integrated Sustainment Maintenance  (ISM),  which  integrates  sustainment  mainte› nance activities for the active and reserve components. FY 96 field tests and demonstrations showed improvements in maintenance processes and performance. Repair times decreased by 30 percent, visibility of mainte› nance  increased,  and capacity  for  maintenance  increased. The program will be implemented throughout the Total Army in FY 97. The Army has completed plans for fielding the program within CONUS and is continu› ing its planning for fielding integrated sustainment maintenance overseas.

A  controlled  humidity  preservation  program  sought  in  FY  96  to reduce maintenance costs  by deferring equipment maintenance  through the use of dehumidification technology.  Dehumidification,  an  old  tech› nology adapted to new uses, permits maintenance to be deferred up to five years for equipment stored  in  an environment below  50 percent relative humidity. Equipment removed from the protective environment, used for training, and returned to the protective environment accrues maintenance

days only while in use. The controlled humidity preservation program was instituted to alleviate the insufficient number of  maintenance technicians. The  technology  is  currently  being  tested  on  690  pieces  of equipment belonging to the Minnesota Guard's  34th Infantry Division and 800 pieces belonging to Mississippi's !55th Armored Brigade. A cost-benefit analy› sis conducted by an independent contractor recommended that the test be expanded; the Guard has  implemented the program  in  fifteen  additional states.

Dehumidification  technology  is  also  being  used  to  reduce  mainte› nance costs in  a program called operational preservation. Equipment that usually  requires  intensive  maintenance,  such  as  M I  Abrams  tanks  and M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, is pumped full  of dehumidified air in its  internal  space and equipped  with external dehumidifiers attached  by ducting.  A  30  percent  reduction  in  unscheduled  maintenance  resulted when tanks were in operational preservation as opposed to when they were exposed to the environment.

## Sustainment

Without an effective sustainment structure, the Army will not be able to  maintain  intense combat activities of any  lengthy  duration.  A  critical consideration is the readiness status of  major weapons systems. The Army has established a baseline of  sixteen  major weapons systems and  identi› fied the percentage of time in which each  is fully  mission capable as  an indicator of  readiness and readiness trends. For aircraft, the goal is 75 per› cent fully mission capable, except for the UH- 60, for which the goal is 80 percent.  For all other equipment,  the goal  is  90 percent.  In FY 96,  the MlA2  Abrams  tank,  the  Heavy  Expanded  Mobility  Tactical  Truck (HEMTT) transporter, the AH-64 helicopter, the CH-470 helicopter, and the UH- 60 helicopter did  not meet the Army's readiness goals. Table  13 indicates the readiness rates of  the sixteen major weapons systems.

During FY 96, the total system availability for all  weapons systems in the active Army, includiJ1g the sixteen major weapons systems, stayed rel› atively stable. The nwnbers of  fully mission-capable (FMC) and not FMC systems are shown  in Table  14.

The total system availability for all separate line items increased sig› nificantly from  FY 95  through FY 96, and  the numbers  of FMC and  not FMC items are shown in Table 15.

Readiness can also be  indicated  by whether sufficient supplies are on hand  or available  within  the  logistical  system. The Army uses  a measure called order-ship time, based on the number of  days from request to receipt of an  Authorized  Stockage  Level  item  divided  by  the  total  number  of requests, to determine the readiness of the supply system. Order-ship  time

goals vary depending upon whether the shipment is made by sea or air and to where it is being shipped. The order-ship time goal in FY 96 for sea trans› portation to Europe was 45 days and to Korea 49 days, while the goal for air transportation to Europe was 23 days and to Korea 28 days. The Army did not meet its surface transportation goals to Europe or Korea from  January to  September 1996-its order-ship time goals to Europe were exceeded by as much as 28 days. The Army usually met its order-ship time goal via air transportation to Korea, however, and for a few months in  1996 met its goal to Europe. Table  16 iJlustrates the average order-ship times for  1996.

As U.S. forces left Europe in the downsizing process and began a tran› sition to a power-projection force,  the Army needed to return vast quanti› ties  of equipment  to  CONUS.  Through  the  RETROEUR program,  the Army moved 6,500 tons of  ammunition, 537 vehicles, and  152 containers of major end items and organizational clothing and individual equipment during  FY  96.  In  addition,  the  Army  shipped  1,3 10  vehicles  to  sites around the United States for repair. The Army fell short of its goals, how› ever,  as  it  did  not  ship  all  of the  equipment  in  FY  96  that  had  been planned. Despite the initial costs of  moving equipment, the Army will save money with reduced maintenance and fewer storage sites in Europe. Table 17 shows  the  RETROEUR goals  and  the  degree  of the Army's accom› plishment of them in FY 96.

The Army has also made significant efforts to reduce costs in its loan lease  program.  Under statutory  authority given  to  the  Secretary  of the

Army, DOD and other federal government organizations can obtain Army equipment through loans or leases. Not all loans are paid on time, howev› er, and the Army is striving to reduce the delinquency rate on outstanding loans to 5 percent or lower. In support of  this goal, AMC developed stan› dardized loan reporting guidance, increased coordination within the major subordinate commands, and implemented an automated loan tracking sys› tem at all major subordinate commands in FY 96. From the beginning to the end ofFY 96, the delinquency rate fell from  11 percent to 5.3 percent, nearly reaching the Army' s goal. Additionally, the Army has developed a database that will enable all outstanding loans and leases to be tracked.

Quality of life has been recognized as  an  important element in sus› tainment, particularly as the number of  operations in which the Army  is involved increases. The Army approved the new "1 + 1"  barracks standard designs in 1994, and these became the DOD standard in December 1995, when the Army began to aggressively modernize its barracks. Using mil› itary construction or payment-in-kind funds, the Army plans to  renovate the worst third  of the 387  barracks  buildings  in  Europe during the next five years. Barracks renewal is the Army's highest priority with respect to facilities. Many  barracks  facilities  in  Europe  were  transferred  to  the United States from Germany and had housed German troops during World War II. Congress has supported the Army's efforts to improve living con› ditions for its soldiers by providing additional funds  on nttmerous occa› sions to accelerate the process. Congress has also required DOD to mon› itor  barracks  renewal  in  the  military  services  and  to  provide  quarterly reports.

Under the I+ 1 construction standard, a  barracks complex  will  have numerous buildings that provide many different functions. A soldier com› munity building will include dayrooms, mail area, common kitchen, bulk storage for each soldier, and a CQ (charge-of-quarters) office. In the new company operations buildings, soldiers returning from a field exercise or deployment will be able to discard their dirty equipment in a "mud room," wash up in the shower facilities, and store their clean field gear away from their personal living space until the next round of  training. A dining facil› ity and separate buildings for battalion and brigade headquarters will also be  incorporated.  Within  the  barracks  complex,  the  design  allows  for increased  parking,  professional landscaping, more  open  space,  and planned recreational facilities. Barracks buildings, employing consolidat› ed laundry facilities, will provide one washer and one dryer for every fif› teen soldiers. Each soldier will live in a private room (118 square feet) that has  built-in  closets,  separate  temperature  controls,  and  connections  for phone and cable. A  suite will consist of two  individual rooms sharing a private  bathroom  and  a  food  service  area  with  a  refrigerator,  sink,  and microwave oven. The Army also intends to equip all renovated or new bar-

racks  with  completely new  furnishings  and  has  received  $40  million in funding per year for the project. These innovations will improve the qual› ity of  life enormously for young enlistees who, for decades, have lived in crowded rooms with other soldiers, used communal bathrooms down the hall  or on another floor,  had no storage space for required gear, missed telephone ca!Js because only one existed in the building for their use, were not allowed to have food in their rooms, and had to make do with dilapi› dated furniture.

While  soldiers  were  deployed  to  Bosnia  during  Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  the Army took advantage of the barracks that were empty to accomplish some renovation. In FY 96, the Army had 82 projects at 23 CONUS and 21  overseas locations under design or construction; costing $2 billion, these will provide renovated living spaces for more than 22,000 soldiers. The FY 96 construction program also budgeted $306 million for barracks  modernization  and  will  add  4,000  new  or  renovated  living spaces.

In dealing with another quality-of-life issue, the Army Uniform Board reviews proposed uniform items for approval by the CSA. In FY 96, the board  recommended  eliminating the women's handbag and replacing  it with a cash allowance, as women soldiers preferred to purchase commer› cial handbags that complied with Army standards. As of 1 October 1997, new soldiers will receive $28.60 in their initial clothing allowance and an annual  replacement allowance of  $19.07. In addition, the Army approved the black Air Force cardigan sweater for wear with hospital and Class B uniforms effective  September  1997,  saving expenditures  on developing such items. The board recommended and the CSA approved a test of  two fabrics to replace the fabric currently in Army green service and materni› ty  uniforms,  which  soldiers  have  said is  uncomfortable  in  hot weather, wrinkles easily,  and wears out quickly.  During FY 96, fielding began of the long- and short-sleeve shirts (designed to be tucked in at the waist), the belted slacks, and the dress belt with brass buckle of  the new women's  ser› vice uniform. These uniform items incorporated the new DOD sizing sys› tem  based on body  measurements, which significantly improved fit and comfort.

## Security Assistance

The security assistance program supports U.S.  national security and military strategies  by promoting U.S.  foreign  policy  and  defense policy. Through  security  assistance,  the  United  States  assists  other nations  in developing or maintaining sufficient military capability to defend them› selves from aggressors, thereby decreasing the likelihood of  U.S. military involvement on their behalf. In addition to improving regional and world

stability, the security assistance program has a positive effect on the U.S. economy by supporting the defense industrial base.

The Army  is  involved  with the security  assistance  program through foreign  military sales, and the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command is responsible  for  conducting  the  program  in  other countries  and  with international organizations. From a  high point of $11.1  billion in  FY 9 1, Army foreign military sales have fluctuated in the 1990s, as Table 18 indi› cates. The $3.8 billion in  FY 96  sales, although far below FY 91's level, represented increases of  65 percent and 46 percent over FY 94 and FY 95, respectively.

The security  assistance  program  requires  the  stationing overseas of numerous civilians. The mission in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, employs budget analysts,  logistics  managers,  quality  assurance specialists,  country  pro› gram managers, case managers,  and system administrators.  In  addition, AMC,  consisting  primarily  of civilians,  also  maintains  overseas  work› forces.  On  J  3 November  1995, 5 Americans were killed (  4  DA civilians and 1 soldier) and 54 wounded (41  civilians and  13 soldiers) when terror› ists attacked an AMC installation in Riyadh. In March 1996, AMC dedi› cated  the  Civilian  Purple  Heart Memorial on  the  top  floor  of its  head› quarters building to its employees who  were  killed  and  wounded  in  the attack.

Under  the  Foreign  Assistance  Act  of  1961,  the  President  has  the authority to  provide equipment, services, and training from DOD organi› zations to support foreign policy programs or for emergencies such as mil› itary crises,  humanitarian operations, peacekeeping operations, or coun› terdrug activities. This presidential drawdown authority, although it limits the amount that may be taken in any fiscal year, requires no legislation or appropriations.  As  Congress  gives  no  additional  budget  funding,  any drawdowns must be funded through OMA funds, though the execution of the drawdown may occur over several years.

Using  the drawdown  authority,  the  President in February 1996 approved $100 million in equipment  for  Jordan  to  support its  efforts  to maintain peace in the Middle East. Equipment included 88 M60A3 tanks, 38 UH-IH helicopters (20 in nonoperational eondHion), 250 Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicles, 216 machine guns, 88  radios, and 18 MilO how-

itzers. In July  1996,  drawdown  equipment  valued  at  $100  million  was authorized for the Bosnian Federation to maintain stability in the Balkan region.  This  equipment  consisted  of 45  M60A3  tanks,  80  Ml13A2 armored  personnel  carriers,  15  UH- lH  helicopters,  116  M114  refur› bished  howitzers,  uniforms, publications, small arms, ammunition, com› munications equipment, and MILES  (Multiple  Integrated Laser Engagement System).  Another drawdown  occurred  in  September  1996 when $10 million of equipment was approved for Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda to assist them in containing Sudan. The Army equipment for these countries  consisted  of  11,716  sets  of load-bearing  equipment;  11,716 pairs  of boots;  and  557  general-purpose  medium  tents.  In  September 1996,  the  drawdown  authority  provided  $15  million  in  equipment  for Liberia  to  support  peacekeeping  operations.  This  equipment  included water  purification  tablets; 6,000 waterproof bags;  65  general-purpose medium  tents;  500  tarps;  3  water  tankers;  3  M818  tractors;  50  sets  of binoculars;  a  company-level  field  kitchen  system;  2  inflatable  landing boats; and medical equipment. Finally, in the last drawdown of  FY 96, the President approved $76.5 million of  equipment for Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Eastern Caribbean countries for counterdrug activities. Among items that were requested, some of  which were delivered by the end of  the fiscal  year,  were  12  UH- 1  H  helicopters,  20  UH-lH  helicopter  hulks (nonoperable  helicopters  that can  be  used  for  on-the-ground  training), field gear, and flak vests.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

Despite the decline in procurement funds, the Army is continuing to develop several new weapons systems as well as upgrade existing ones. Maintaining a smaller force necessitates a concentrated effort to imple› ment  new  technologies  to  ensure  that  the  Army  achieves  battlefield superiority.

The Crusader field artillery system demonstrated its ability to meet all significant range requirements in tests of  its advanced solid propellant gun and modular artillery charge system in FY 96. As a result, the Army initi› ated the detail design phase of  the Crusader. The Crusader is  currently in the demonstration and validation phase and is scheduled for the engineer› ing and development phase in 2000. The Crusader is a 155-mm. self-pro› pelled  howitzer  that  will  provide  the  indirect fire  support to  maneuver forces in the future. When fielded, the Crusader will replace the Ml09A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer and the M992 field artillery ammunition supply  vehicle.  Other  features  of the  Crusader  include  an  automated ammunition  handling  system,  an  advanced  fire  control  system,  and  a remote multioption fuze. The resupply vehicle for the Crusader possesses

a tete-operated docking arm, an automated ammunition resupply system, and an automated fuel  transfer system. Both the howitzer and the resup› ply vehicle  have  improved  mobility,  enabling them  to  accompany  fast› moving combat forces.

The THAAD system is currently involved in flight tests, and, follow› ing  their  successful  completion,  a  prototype  system  for  evaluation  of THAAD user operation will be fielded in FY 98. The demonstration and validation contract for THAAD was awarded  in FY 92. Complementing the Patriot missile in the lower tier, the THAAD system is designed to be the upper tier of a  two-tier tactical  ballistic missile defense system pro› tecting military forces and civilian populations from theater ballistic mis› siles. Fully transportable by military aircraft, the THAAD can be deployed rapidly  worldwide  and  will  be  mobile  on unimproved  roads  as well  as highways.  The  THAAD  system  includes  hypervelocity  kinetic  energy missiles to kill incoming missiles; launchers mounted on modified Ml075 palletized loading system sixteen-ton trucks that can carry up to eight mis› siles  each;  X-band radar capable of  tracking incoming missiles and dis› tinguishing friend or foe; and support equipment. THAAD's  accuracy and lethaUty will neutralize tactical ballistic missile warheads before they hit their  targets,  making  it  possible  to  reduce  the  amount  of dangerous debris-or chemical and biological agentsthat will reach the ground. In addition,  the THAAD system  includes  a  battle  management/command, control, communications, computers,  and intelligence system (BM/C4I) that will plan, coordinate, and execute the tactical ballistic missile battle. Mounted in shelters on Humvees, the BM/C41 can interface with Army and joint command and control systems, other air defense systems, space sensors, remote launchers, and ground-based radars.

The Javelin antitank missile system is currently in its third year of  low› rate initial production,  with deUvery  scheduled to begin later in  1996 and end in 2002. A man-portable system designed for dismounted infantry, com› bat engineers, scouts, the Marine Corps, and the Army's  first combat forces to arrive in an area, the JaveUn will replace the Dragon missile system. With digital  fire-and-forget  technology,  the gunner can  immediately take  cover after  firing  the  missile,  which  has  a  range  of more  than  2,000  meters. Alternatively, the missile can be fired from within enclosed areas and cov› ered  fighting  positions  using  a  soft-launch  feature.  The  Javelin  system, weighing forty-nine  pounds, consists of a missile sealed in a  lightweight, disposable launch tube assembly and a reusable command and launch unit with a simple latching mechanism to attach to the missile. Incorporating an integrated sight for day or night vision, the command and launch unit may be used separately for battlefield surveillance and target detection.

After the first flight of the prototype RAH-66 Comanche helicopter in January 1996, which lasted fifteen minutes, a series of  flight tests were

conducted throughout the rest of  the year to develop the helicopter's full flight capabilities. The program is currently in its demonstration and vali› dation phase. In March 1995 DOD approved an early operation capabili› ty program requiring two flyable prototypes and six aircraft for field tests and evaluations during FY 01- FY 03, with initial operational capability scheduled for 2006. Designed to be the Army's newest air cavalry recon› naissance  and  light  attack  helicopter,  the  Comanche  will  replace  the AH- 1, OH- 6, and OH- 58A/C helicopters and will perform their missions of  armed reconnaissance and attack as well as serving as a command and control aircraft for commanders on the future battlefield. Requiring fewer personnel  and  less  support  equipment  than  its  predecessors,  the  light› weight Comanche can be transported rapidly by air. Tailored to respond to regional  situations  and possessing  worldwide  navigation  capability,  the Comanche can fly  to Europe, the  Middle East, and Latin America. The twin-engine  helicopter  has  day,  night,  and  adverse  weather  capability; minimum dash  speed of more than  170  knots;  retractable landing gear; and armament that includes the Hellfire antitank missile system, Stinger missiles, 2.75-inch rockets, and a 20-m.m. turreted gun. Its advanced elec› tronics, second-generation target acquisition and night vision sensors, and secure avionics will permit the Comanche to acquire, recognize, and set priorities for multiple targets, as weU as pass information on them to other weapons systems, computers, and organizations.

In December 1995,  the 3d  Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, at Fort Hood, Texas, became the first unit equipped with M 1A2 tanks, an upgrad› ed  configmation of the older MlAl  tanks. With production  of the Ml tanks scheduled to end in 1995, the Army in 1994 approved an upgrade of 998 M  AJ  tanks to MlA2s and planned to equip the CONUS contingency I force  with  the  newer  configuration.  With  digital  data architecture  inte› grating the electronic components, the MIA2 is the first fully integrated computer-driven  ground  combat  system.  Other  improvements  over  the Ml A I include a commander's independent thermal viewer, an improved commander's weapon station, position  and navigation equipment, and a distributed data and power architecture. Future enhancements planned for the  MJ tanks  include  digital  systems  improvements,  second-generation forward-looking infrared sensor upgrades, and a gunner's  primary sight.

During  FY  96,  upgrades  of 1,602  M2A2/M3A2  Bradley  Fighting Vehicle systems to the M2A3/M3A3 model occurred, with fielding sched› lLied  for  2001.  The M2A3/M3A3  configurations will have  an  improved target  acquisition  viewer,  a  second-generation  digital  forward-looking infrared  system,  and  a  data  system  compatible  with  M l A2  tank  and AH- 64 helicopter information systems. The Bradley is an armored, fully tracked combat vehicle for mounted infantry (M2 infantry fighting vehi› cle  [IFV])  and  mounted  cavalry  (M3  CFV),  providing  protection from

artillery  and  small  arms  fire.  The  IFV  and  CFV  arc  indistinguishable externally and  have  the  same armament and  vehicular performance; the IFV is designed for a squad of  nine infantry soldiers. The Army produced 4,641 M2s and 2,083 M3s by 1994, each in three versions: the basic ver› sion; the A I version,  which  incorporated the TOW 2 subsystem; and the A2 high-survivability configuration. In addHion to converting A2 versions to  A3s,  the Army  is  converting all  remaining Als to A2s.  In  1995,  the Army converted A2s to A20DS, basing improvements on lessons learned during  Operation  DBSBRT  STORM.  These  changes  encompassed  a  laser range finder, global positioning system with compass, combat identifica› tion, driver's  thermal viewer, and a missile countermeasure. The upgrades conducted in FY 96 built upon the A20DS improvements.

ATACMS  is  the Army's primary effort at modernizing  its  precision strike capability.  Lessons  learned  from Operation DESERT STORM  indicat› ed that  ATACMS,  a  long-range,  all-weather,  day/night  weapon  used against mobile  targets  and  surface-to-surface  missiles,  needed  a  longer range. A ground-launched, conventional, surface-to-surface, semi-guided ballistic  missile, ATACMS  consists of  Block I, Block IA, Block II,  and Block  IIA  systems.  Block I  is  in  its  last year of full-scale  production, while low-rate initial production of  Block IA, which will double Block l' s range and  . improve  accuracy  with  a  global positioning system  receiver, began  in  June  1996 and  is  in  its third year of  engineering and  manufac› turing development. Block J and lA systems attack tactical surface-to-sur› face missile sites; air defense systems; logistics elements; and command, control,  and  communications  complexes  with antipersonnel  or antima› tcriel  warheads.  The  Block  II  system  attacks  moving  armored  targets, while the Block IIA system attacks a target set; both  use antiarmor sub› munition warheads.

The MLRS launcher and its  basic rocket with an M77 warhead were in  fu ll-scale production and delivery in  FY 96. Batteries have been field› ed  to active Army and Guard units  in  CONUS, as well  as  in  Europe and Korea. The MLRS, a self-loading M270 launcher with fire control system mounted on a  highly  mobile tracked vehicle, can fire  its  twelve  rockets individually  or  together  to  a  range  of thirty-two  kilometers  and  then depart,  limiting  its  exposure  to  counterbattery  fire. Also in FY  96, improvements to the MLRS were being developed for an FY 98 advanced concept technology demonstration and included an  improved fire control system,  an  improved  launcher  mechanical  system,  an  extended-range MLRS,  and  a  High-Mobility Artillery  Rocket  System  (HIMARS).  The improved  launcher mechanical  system will enable MLRS to engage tar› gets more quickly, thereby increasing survivability for the crew, while the extended-range MLRS will increase the rocket's range to forty-five kilo› meters. The HIMARS, mounted on a five-ton truck, will enable the MLRS

to  be rolled on and off a C- 130 aircraft and ready to fire within minutes of landing, although it can carry only one rocket.

The entire AH- 64 Apache helicopter fleet was being modernized in FY 96, and the Longbow Apache program was the Army's  second largest aviation  program then and  for  the  foreseeable  future.  A  total  of  227  of 758 Apaches will be remanufactured to the AH-640 Longbow configu› ration,  which  includes  fire  control  radar  mission  kits.  The  remaining Apaches are being upgraded to baseline AH- 64Ds without the fire con› trol  radar mission kit and  upgraded  engine, though these can be added later to  create the  Longbow Apache. The Longbow Apache moderniza› tion program will employ the Hellfire laser missile and the new Longbow Hellfire radio-frequency missile, which will  be the  first fire-and-forget precision  missile in an attack helicopter.  The Longbow system acquires ground and air targets, as well as radio emitters on the ground, and pass› es targeting data to  the onboard Hellfire missiles,  the pilots, other air› craft, and other weapons systems such as M1A2 tanks and the advanced field artillery tactical data  system. The pilots may engage up  to sixteen targets in one minute, significantly reducing their exposure to enemy fire. The  fire  control  radar  and  the  Longbow  Hellfire  missile  were  under development in FY 96.

To  improve  its  ability  to  project  and  sustain  the  force,  the  Army implemented a UH-60 Black Hawk modification program that increas› es speed and lift capabilities.  By  the end of  FY 96,  the Army had pur› chased 470 UI-I- 60L versions, and it will procure more in FY 97. These modified Black Hawks have new roles  in command and  control, elec› tronic  warfare,  and  special  operations,  supplementing  their  primary roles as the Army's  main utility helicopter in air assault, general support, and  medical evacuation missions.

The Army began fielding the new family of  medium tactical vehicles to  active Army  units  in  January  1996  to  improve  ground  transportation capability. The family  of medium tactical  vehicles (MTV)  includes 2 121 ton light  medium tactical  vehicles  (LMTV) (cargo and  van  models) and five-ton  MTVs  (cargo,  tractor,  wrecker,  and  dump  truck  models)  on  a common truck chassis.  Under the production contract awarded  in  1991, the Army will receive 10,843 vehicles7,738 LMTVs and 3,105 MTVs. Van and tanker models, as well as trailers, remain under development.

The Humvee is the principal  light vehicle in Army  units and serves as a platform for other Army weapons systems. An up-armored version (a  Humvee  with armored plating and  bulletproof windows designed to withstand  land  mine or ordnance  blasts)  has  360 degrees of protection from 7.62-mm. armor-piercing rounds,  12.6 pounds of  dynamite protec› tion  on  the  underbody,  and  overhead protection from  fragmentation  of 155-mm. rounds at 60 meters. The up-armored version will be fielded to

military police companies and was deployed during FY 96 for operations in  Macedonia  and  Bosnia. An  expanded  capacity vehicle Humvee that can carry a  larger payload  has  been developed and  will  soon be  in  the testing phase.

The  service  life  extension  program for  the  CH-470  Chinook  heli› copter continued  in FY 96.  Originally fielded  in 1962, the  CH-4  7 fleet was modernized in 1982; those modernization efforts will be twenty years old in 2002. The Army has no cargo helicopter replacement on  the hori› zon  before 2020 or 2025.  Upgrading the CH-47D fuselage and cockpit will extend its useful  life another twenty years  and permit it to  interface with the digital battlefield.

In response to fratricide occurrences during Operation DESERT STORM, the Army developed short-term, mid-term, and long-term programs to dif› ferentiate  friendly  and  enemy  forces  on the  battlefield. The  short-term program, Quickfix,  includes  passive infrared  lights  and  panels  and  has been fielded  to operational units. The mid-term program, the  battlefield combat identification system (BCIS), completed its engineering and man› ufacturing development testing in FY 96. BCIS is an encrypted question› and-answer identification system that operates via a vehicle's laser range finder  and  interrogator  antenna.  Tests  were  conducted  on  MlAl  and MlA2 tanks, the M2/M3 Bradley, fire support teams, and Humvees in all weather conditions, including heavy rain, fog, and smoke. Correct identi› fication occurred 99 percent of the time. An enhanced version of BCIS, the  long-term  element  in  the  Army's Combat  Identification  Program, includes a digital data link for ground vehicles and combat identification for air-to-ground operations. This enhanced BCIS has been developed and will be demonstrated in the March  1997 AWE.

A complete upgrade of the Patriot air defense missile,  the  lower tier of the  two-tier  tactical  missile  defense  system,  was  being  conducted  in conjunction with the development of  THAAD. The program, which will upgrade PAC-2 missiles to PAC-3, will enable the Patriot to engage the› ater ballistic missiles  at  longer ranges  and with greater lethality.  PAC- 3 missiles will  also  be more effective against aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

In  FY 96, the Army continued development of the Land Warrior, an integrated system for dismounted combat soldiers. Each soldier would be equipped with an  individual computer/radio, enhanced protective cloth› ing,  and  improved  individual  equipment  Additionally,  soldiers  would wear integrated headgear that contained a helmet-mounted display with an image intensifier and  a modular weapons system. The modular weapons system is composed of  a thermal weapon sight, infrared aiming light, laser range  finder,  digital  compass,  video  camera,  and  close  combat  optic. Additional  technology  is  expected  to  be  incorporated  into  the  Land

Warrior program as a result of the Force XXI A  WE in March  1997. The Army expects to field the Land Warrior in FY 00.

Congress approved $9.8 million to fund the first year of a three-year demonstration and validation phase  for  the  Stinger Block II  in  FY 96; DOD approved an expenditure of $10.9 million for  FY 97.  No funding was approved for FY 98. The Army's primary air defense missile for air defense artillery and aviation, Stinger Block I has experienced a problem with clutter that reduces its ability to acquire targets. Stinger Block II will eliminate much of  that clutter.  The engineering and manufacturing devel› opment phase is scheduled to begin in FY 00.

As a result of  the enormous problems encountered due to the presence of mines  in  Bosnia during  Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  the Army estab› lished a Countermine Task Force in FY 96. The task force's goal  was to facilitate the conversion of  laboratory technology into fielded equipment so that soldiers in Bosnia could detect, avoid, clear, and neutralize mines more safely and effectively. The task force also began to develop a strate› gy for future countermine technology.

To support the Army's critical mission of  training soldiers in realistic environments,  the  first  CCTT  simulators  were  fielded  in  1996  at  Fort Hood, Texas. Full-scale production will begin in FY 98. AMC, industry, and  academia worked together to  create this  collective training system. Armor and mechanized infantry units can train full crews in simulators patterned  after  their  combat  vehicles,  weapons  systems,  and  command and control elements. The simulators are networked and permit real-time, interactive, collective training on computer-generated terrain.  Each vehi› cle  simulator's  host  computer  depicts  battlefield  views  through  crew optics; additionally, the MIAl, MIA2, and M2/M3 simulators provide the vehicle  commander  with  a  panoramic  view  from  his  hatch  position. Although  reservists  will  have  access  to  fixed  CCTT  training  sites  on weekends, mobile CCTT versions mounted on truck trailers will be dis› persed to USAR home stations.

The Warfighting Rapid Acquisition Program (WRAP), a new policy approved in April  1996, will accelerate the fielding of systems and tech› nologies  from  TRADOC  advanced  warfighting  experiments,  advanced technology  demonstrations,  advanced  concept  technology  demonstra› tions,  and  similar demonstrations and evaluations. The TRADOC  com› mander can initiate a WRAP Army Systems Acquisition Review Council to select programs that require urgent funding for operational prototypes. WRAP  is  an  essential  tool in the Army  XXI  Acquisition  Reform Reinvention  Center that is  being established to  field  advanced  systems demonstrated in Force XXI.

Research remained an important effort in FY 96, even though funding had declined over recent years. The Construction Engineering Research

Laboratory (CERL) had fifty-seven Cooperative Research and Development Agreements and more than 100 Memoranda of Understanding with government, academic, and industry organizations. In FY 96, CERL developed the Facilities Infrastructure Technology Program to  increase technology and research aimed at improving Army facilities.

The Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), operating  from  thirty-three  existing  or new  Cooperative  Research  and Development Agreements, provided scientific, engineering research, and technological  support  to  the  Army  and  other  organizations.  In  1  996, CRREL researchers worked at the South Pole to demonstrate the feasibil› ity  of drilling  a  subsw-face  snow  tunnel for the  future  U.S.  South  Pole Station.  Other CRREL researchers  worked with the  Navy  in  the  Arctic Ocean, often under dangerous conditions, to understand the effects of  sea ice on naval operations. In addition, CRREI.:s civil works programs assist› ed the Army Corps of Engineers in applying remote sensing to  monitor water resources management and emergency operations.

The Army's  Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) focused its activ› ities in FY 96 on military operations and Force XXI. TEC personnel sup› ported diplomats and military advisors at the Bosnia Peace Talks in  1996 with  time-sensitive  maps  and  terrain  visualization  products,  using  a Multispectral  Imagery  Processor  and  working  in  cooperation  with  the Defense Mapping Agency. In support of  Force XXI, TEC fielded a proto› type  of  the  Digital  Topographic  Support  Systems/Quick Response Multicolor Printer, mounted in both the Heavy (five-ton truck) and Light (Humvee) versions. Both versions were evaluated at Fort Hood, Texas, in support of  the 4th Infantry Division in FY 96 and will be part of  the Force XXI AWE in March 1997. TEC became the lead laboratory for the Rapid Battlefield Visualization ACTD, the highest priority ACTD within DOD. In  conjunction with the Environmental Institute of  Michigan, TEC devel› oped  the  Interferometric  Synthetic  Aperture  Radar  for  Digital  Terrain Elevations. This  new  radar,  along  with TEC  personnel,  was  shipped  to Bosnia to collect high-resolution  terrain data. DrawLand, a three-dimen› sional software system for militaty terrain visualization that incorporates intelligence  information,  was  developed  by  TEC  in  cooperation  with United Kingdom researchers and used in Bosnia.

## Support Services

## Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation

Operation  DESERT  STORM  taught  military  leaders  that  the Army's Morale, Welfare, and  Recreation  (MWR) program needed  to  meet the needs of  commanders and troops in wartime as well as in garrison. With that  in  mind,  senior  civilian  MWR specialists  deployed  to  Bosnia  in November 1995 in support of Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  well ahead of the  main  body of troops.  For the first  time,  the  Army  had  established MWR as  mission-essential  support  requiring  concurrent  mobilization with soldiers.  MWR volunteers in Bosnia were as exposed to the dan› gers of war as the soldiers  with whom they lived, worked, and support› ed. Fifty-four MWR professionals deployed to camps in 42 locations for periods  ranging  from  3  to  12  months.  Administered  by  USAREUR, these MWR specialists ensured that soldiers had access to sports and fit› ness  programs,  recreational activities,  entertainment, and other leisure options. Over the course ofFY 96, MWR sponsored a book kit program, providing more than 81,000 paperback books to  units deployed in sup› port of  Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR.  In  recognition of  MWR's increased wartime  role,  the  Army  published  new  doctrinal  guidance  in  FY  96 describing how MWR support will  be given to deployed  or mobilized units. In another recognition of  the importance ofMWR, a decision was made  to  fund  MWR operations during such  contingencies with appro› priated funds.

The Army established the U.S. Army Conununity and Family Support Center (CFSC) in  1984 as a field operating agency under ODCSPER. In 1993, CFSC moved under the control of the OACSIM and was responsi› ble for the worldwide activities of  the MWR program. CFSC restructw·ed itself  internally in November  1995,  adding  foltr new  divisions› Marketing, Public Affairs, Sponsorship Advertising, and Asset Management. Through the Asset Management Division, installation com› manders encouraged development of  private business activities by provid› ing real estate space in exchange for a percentage of  the revenues. The rev› enues were applied directly to the installation's MWR account. In FY 96,

the first year of  the program, the Army processed twenty-five requests for private development activities totaling $154 million.

Another significant change occurred in May  1996, when the Army created  the  CFSC  Hospitality  Directorate. By  transferring  Transient Housing and the Army Billeting Fund responsibilities from  OACSlM to CFSC,  the Army  established  an  umbrella  organization  for  all  lodging functions within the Army. Temporary duty  lodging, guesthouses, recre› ational lodging, and Armed Forces Recreation Centers were now all  under the  purview  of one  organization.  Since  the  Army  operates  more  than 25,000 rooms at 101  locations, this process produced significant savings by  reducing inefficiency, eliminating  duplication,  and  streamlining administrative procedures.

An exciting addition to the Army's inventory of hotel rooms occurred in November 1995 when the Maile Tower, a 396-room addition to the Hale Koa Hotel, was dedicated on Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. The dedication cer› emony took place on the twentieth anniversary of  the Hale Koa's original structure,  the Ilima Tower.  This expansion and renovation project, which also developed 66 acres at F01t DeRussy, where the hotel is located, last› ed three years and cost $99 million. No tax revenues were used for the pro› ject; the money was raised entirely from nonappropriated fundsprofits from commissaries, post exchanges, clubs, and other faciJities frequented by soldiers.

In a  notable development on the other side of the world, the General Walker Hotel  in  Berchtesgaden,  Germany,  which  had  served  nearly  five million guests over a period spanning forty-three years, closed its doors. In June  1996,  the  Armed  Forces  Recreation  Center  in  Berchtesgaden  shut down operations, and the resort was returned to the German government. The  Armed  Forces  Recreation  Centers  at  Chiemsee  and  Garmisch› Partenkirchen  were  consolidated  into  Armed  Forces  Recreation  Center Bavaria in an effort to reduce expenditures and develop economies of  scale.

The MWR program is funded by both appropriated funds and nonap› propriated funds.  Total  funding for MWR in FY 96 was more than $ I .3 billion,  an  increase of  $42  million from  the previous year. Appropriated funds  constituted  33  percent  of MWR funding,  while  nonappropriated funds comprised 67 percent. Disparities within the two  budget processes have caused difficulties in the Army's ability to execute either in a timely manner or to exercise flexibility with respect to the expendhure of  funds. The National Defense Authorization Act ofFY 96, in an effort to correct this problem, ordered DOD to develop and conduct a demonstration pro› gram that merged appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund support for MWR.  The  merged  funds  would  then  be executed  as  nonappropriated funds. The  Army  developed  demonstration  projects  at  White  Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

The Army seeks continually to improve profitability in the MWR pro› gram,  and  in FY 96 profits  increased  in  all  three MWR program  cate› gories. Category A includes all mission-essential programs, such as sports activities, libraries, and recreation centers; Category B encompasses youth services, child care, arts and crafts, entertainment, and outdoor recreation; and  Category  C  consists of all  self-sufficient programs  that receive  no appropriated  funds,  such  as  golf,  bowling,  Armed  Forces  Recreation Centers,  and  clubs. Within  Category  A,  the  Army  made  significant progress toward the goal of  meeting requirements with only appropriated funds.  Category  A  losses  decreased  by  $4.5  million,  and  appropriated fund  support increased by $6.1  million.  Category B showed an improve› ment from  previous fiscal years, with a positive net income. Profitability of Category C activities improved dramatically, with net income increas› ing 65.4 percent from FY 95.

The Army assessed its MWR program at twenty-four installations and learned that fine dining and traditional activities offered at clubs for offi› cers,  noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel held less appeal for  soldiers,  families,  and civilians  than  in  the  past.  The average  MWR customer  preferred  quick  service,  casual  family  dining,  or  privately catered  f1mctions.  In  response,  CFSC  developed  five  theme  restaurants and,  in FY  96,  opened  three of them.  Primo's Italian Restaurant began operating  at  Fort Hood, Texas;  Primo's Express was established at Fort Drum,  New  York;  and  Strike  Zone  opened  its  doors  at  Fort  Shafter, Hawaii.

The MWR Board of  Directors, in its fourth year of  existence, voted to add the Sergeant Major of  tbe Army as one of its members. The board of directors  now consists of the Sergeant Major of the Army and the com› manding generals  of FORSCOM, TRADOC, Eighth U.S.  Army,  AMC, USAREUR and Seventh U.S. Army, and USARPAC. In FY 96, the board continued  a  $40  million  nonappropriated  fund  major  construction  pro› gram and approved another $40 million for a nonappropriated construc› tion program in FY 97.

Another program designed to improve the quality of life of  soldiers, family  members,  civilians,  and  retirees  is  the AFAP.  Delegates  to  sym› posia  at  installations and  major Army commands develop issues and set priorities; steering committees review progress on resolving the issues and provide written feedback to  communities. Until FY 96, the Army hosted an annual worldwide AFAP conference in Washington, D.C., at which del› egates presented  key  issues  to  the  Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.  The issues presented began to require more attention from levels above HQDA and,  hence,  additional  time  for  resolution. In April 1996,  the  Army announced that  the worldwide AFAP conference would occur biennially instead  of annually  but recommended  that  installations  and  MACOMs

conduct annual AFAP symposia. A general officer steering committee will meet semiannually to resolve issues at the HQDA level.

In an effort to improve quality of life and health for civilian employ› ees, Army Regulation (AR) 600-63, Army Health Promotion, authorized administrative leave for participation in a structured, command-sponsored physical  fitness  program  for  three  hours  weekly  up  to eight  weeks. Behavioral research, however, suggested that permanent lif estyle changes could not be expected to occur within two months. An AFAP recommen› dation resulted  in  revisions  to  the  regulation  in  March  and  May  1996, authorizing extension of  the program to six months. Employees are limit› ed  to  taking  advantage  of the  program  only  once;  thereafter,  they  are encouraged to conduct physical fitness training on their own, and employ› ers are urged to allow flexible work schedules.

Quality of  life is the Army's third highest priority, immediately behind readiness  and  modernization. The quality  of life  available  in  the  Army directly affects readiness, and the Army therefore has committed itself to providing a standard of living  for  soldiers and  families  similar to  that of their  civilian  counterparts.  Soldiers  and  family  members  remain  deeply concerned about pay and benefits, medical care, commissary and exchange privileges,  housing,  recreational  facilities,  retirement  packages, and  sup› port to families during mobilization and deployment.  With a  force  that is 66 percent married and in which 8 percent of  the members are single par› ents, the Army found  it vital to develop family support initiatives in FY 96.

One of  the biggest lessons of  Operation DESERT STORM  was that fam› ily members of  deployed service members had innumerable problems and questions, felt confused and abandoned, and often did not know where to tum  to  obtain  resolution  or  answers. In 1993,  the Army  Family  Team Building  program,  in  an  effort  to  create  self-sufficient  and  self-reliant individuals and families  who could  cope with the stress of deployment, began  teaching  individuals  and families  about Army  missions,  military lif e, effects of  family separations, and available support organizations. By FY 96, the Army had established family support groups as a major source of  support for every deployment.

Since the  majority of Army soldiers are  married, and  because  more households now have a nonservice member who works outside the horne, the Army  has  significantly  increased  the  number of childcare  facilities over the years.  In  FY 96,  the vast majority of  chlldcare centers received national accreditation. In addition to providing quality childcare, the Army has endeavored to  improve management efficiency. In FY 96, nonappro› priated fund subsidies for childcare were reduced significantly, indicating the economic health of the Army childcare system.

Until recently, teenagers had not been recognized as a separate entity within the Army family.  In September 1996, however, the first Army Teen

Panel was established to enable teens to express their views and concerns to the highest levels of  the Army. Eleven teenagers, from fifteen to seven› teen years of  age, were selected as delegates from the various major Army commands.  Working  in  concert with teen program  specialists,  the Teen Panel conducted a survey of 1,600 teens on youth violence and the lack of teen centers on  installations. The Teen Panel briefed the CFSC comman› der and the wife of  the CSA on their findings, and developed a home page for the Internet.

## Health and Medical

The overwhelming success of Operation DESERT STORM and the rela› tively small number of  medical casualties have Jed some military analysts to  speculate  that  future  wars  will  be  virtually  bloodless.  The AMEDD, however, pointing to the proliferation of  nuclear weapons, terrorist groups, and ethnic strife, believes that physical risks to soldiers undoubtedly exist. Striving to provide appropriate medical care for soldiers in changing envi› ronments, AMEDD has been persistent in integrating medical  personnel into Army and joint training exercises. An interservice working group  at the AMEDD Center and School is currently developing joint medical doc› trine  to support  increased  joint  warfighting in future contingencies. Preparing  for  the  twenty-first century, AMEDD  is  redesigning  itself to support the new Army organizational  structure and warfighting doctrine of  Force XXI. AMEDD's top developmental priorities in FY 96 remained the UH- 60Q Medevac Helicopter and armored ambulances, essential for extracting soldiers from  remote areas and providing quality medical care en route to triage locations.

Telemedicine  is probably  the  key technology  that  will improve AMEDD's ability  to  operate  on  the future  battlefield and  save  lives, as well as change health care around the world. Tactical use oftelemedicine expands  the  reach  of medical  specialists  forward  into  the  battlefield. Deployed  medical  hospitals  in  Bosnia  and  Hungary  are  currently  con› nected via tclemedicine to Landstuhl  Regional Medical  Center  in Germany,  other  DOD  medical  centers  within  CONUS,  and  the  USS Ge01ge Washington, deployed offshore in the Adriatic. Tactical telemedi› cine has also been deployed in Zagreb, Croatia; Macedonia; Somalia; and Haiti. Within CONUS, Project Seahawk at Madigan Army Medical Center in  Washington  and  Project Akamai  at Tripier Army  Medical  Center  in Hawaii  have  demonstrated  the  usefulness  of telemedicine  in  providing quality  medical  care  in  remote  locations.  When telemedicine  is  imple› mented  completely,  every  health  care  provider  will  have  instantaneous access to specialty care, no matter the geographical location, from hospi› tals,  universities,  and  medical  specialists.  With  access  to  information,

patients can avoid  disease and injury and,  when feasible, can medicaJly treat themselves, reducing their medical costs and time spent visiting doc› tors and clinics.

Within AMEDD,  many  individuals  presently  are  working  to  apply new technology to solving medical problems. One program under devel› opment will help identify when a soldier on the battlefield requires med› ical assistance, thereby reducing or eliminating deaths that occur prior to recognition that a soldier is wounded. The personnel status monitor mea› sures blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, and other vital signs. When a soldier is in physical distress, electronic signals will be immediately sent out,  identifying  the  soldier  and  location to  facilitate  rescue and  medical care. The personnel status monitor will soon be used in Ranger training to avoid any tragedies similar to that of  four soldiers who died of hypother› mia in a Florida swamp during a night training exercise in February 1995.

## Army Chaplaincy

The Army Chaplaincy, similar to other Army corps, found itself deeply involved with Army XXI and Army After Next initiatives. In FY 96, to sup› port chaplain services on the future  battlefield, the Army developed  the Field  Baptismal  Liner, the Chaplain  Assault  Kit, and the  Chaplain Resupply  Kit.  In  addition, the Chaplaincy focused on  issues in the joint arena,  particularly  those  associated  with  the  Marine  Corps.  Operation JOINT  ENDEAVOR  integrated  reserve  chaplains  into  slots  working  beside active Army chaplains, resulting in a  need for additional training during mobilization  and  deployment.  The  Army's Division  Redesign  initiative established a  chaplain's position  as  essential  in  divisions,  particularly  in training environments. The Army recognized that the absence of  chaplains at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, had contributed to an atmosphere in which some drill sergeants sexually harassed some female trainees.

Between June 1995 and January 1996, the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School moved  from  Fort Monmouth, New Jersey,  to  Fort Jackson, South Carolina, as Fort Monmouth was forced to close under the BRAC 93  process. A concrete building erected at Fort Jackson in 1968 had been gutted and refurbished with training and administrative space for $1.4 mil› lion,  providing  an  interim  facility  to  be used until  the  new  center and school is completed in FY 97. The state-of-the-art training facility will be the first ever built specifically for the Chaplain School.

Due to  diminishing  resources,  the  Chaplain  School  in  FY 96  con› ducted the first comprehensive analysis of its instructional strategy. With a new focus on providing essential training commensurate with duties for ministering to  a battalion, the Chaplain School fundamentally redesigned its  curriculum.  Presuming  that professional  skills  as  priests,  ministers,

rabbis, and imans would already be in place, the new instructional strate› gy  was  designed to  teach  only  those  skills  necessary  to  accomplish  the military mission.  In FY 96, the  Chaplain Officer Advanced Course was shortened from twenty to eight weeks,  in part due to concerns about the availability of  family housing at Fort Jackson. The Division Chaplain and Installation  Chaplain  courses  were  combined,  with  the  first  iteration scheduled to occur in  FY  97.  The  restructured Chaplain Officer Basic Course requires more training in residence and provides a greater oppor› tunity for reservists and chaplain candidates to attend.

Primary issues within the Chaplain Corps remained similar to previ› ous  years.  There  were  not enough Roman Catholic priests to  serve the constituency in the Army; this shortage was expected to persist,  with no foreseeable  solution.  Recruiting  was  focused  on  female  chaplains,  but because religious denominations do not ordain many women, there was only a small pool from which to recruit. As a result, only forty-seven chap› lains in the Army were women. Training chaplains in suicide prevention seemed to be effective, and the suicide rate in the Army declined. In 1996, the Chaplain Corps worked on realigning all tasks performed by the chap› lain's assistant (MOS 71M) to eleven specific religious support areas.

## Army Pay

After several months of  planning, the Personnel Command converted to the DCPS in July 1996. After providing training to more than 200 per› sonnel  on  the  new  system,  the  Army  transferred  approximately  1,000 employee  accounts  into  DCPS.  Initial errors made in employee records included  incorrect  health  benefits,  salary  rates,  tax  data,  and  Thrift Savings Plan data. From August to September 1996, customer service rep› resentatives  worked  with  the  Civilian  Personnel  Advisory  Center  to resolve all  discrepancies.

## Army Housing

A critical element of  quality of life is the housing that the Army pro› vides its soldiers and families. Unfortunately, much of  the Army's inven› tory  of  barracks and  family  housing  is decades  old and  requires  repair, upgrade, or replacement. The Army has instituted a revitalization strategy designed  to  produce  excellent  facilities.  The  Army  Whole  Barracks Renewal  Program  will  upgrade  Army  barracks in CONUS  by  FY  07, Europe  by  FY  10,  and  Korea  by  FY  14.  The  Whole  Neighborhood Revitalization Program will improve family housing one neighborhood at a time,  including supporting infrastructure and  amenities.  Units  that are uneconomical to repair or upgrade will be replaced.

The Army  has  established a  revitalization  cycle  that  represents  the number of years  it  will  take to revitalize  the entire Army  housing  infra› structure. From FY 93 to FY 95, the Army's goal was to revitalize facili› ties until all were less than 57 years old, except that family housing would be no older than 35 years. In FY 96, the Army's revitalization goal for bar› racks was reduced from 57 to 25 years. During FY 96, however, the Army did not meet any of its revitalization goals. The average age of all facili› ties was 61, with barracks being 28 and family housing 63  years old.

In the Army Family Housing Construction Program, revitalization is defined as  renovating an existing unit to current standards. Replacement of a unit means demolishing an existing unit and constructing a new one that meets all current standards, including energy conservation.  Both revi› talization and replacement include improvements to the infrastructure and the  neighborhood.  Funding for  the FY 96 program was  little  more than half  of  that in FY 95, as shown  in Table  19.

TABLC  19FY 96 ARMY FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM FUNDING (IN MILLIONS)

|         |   FY 93 |   FY94 |   FY95 |   FY96 |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|

| Actual  |     136 |    286 |    211 |    118 |

The  amount  funded  for  FY 96 was  80  percent  of what  had  been planned. Construction projects funded during the fiscal year are indicated in Table 20.

| Fort Knox, Kentucky         |              150 | Replacement    |
| Fort Lee, Virginia          |              135 | Replacement    |
| Fort Wainwright, Alaska     |               44 | Revitalization |

Despite  some  advances,  the  Army  has  not  had  sufficient  funds  to bring all  housing to  desired  standards nor to  build  the  additional  10,322

dwelling units needed to house its families. In recognition that privatiza› tion could resolve the problems within five to ten years, Congress in  1996 passed the Military Housing Privatization Initiative Act, which gave mili› tary services the authority to contract with private companies to operate, maintain, improve, and construct military housing. The Army established a  Capital Venture Initiative (CVI) team to  implement new DOD policies for  privatization.  Under  the  new  program, a  contractor would  own  and operate family housing, collecting from the occupants rents that would not exceed their housing allowance. A CVI project at Fort Carson, Colorado, approved by DOD, will  result in  840 newly constructed houses and  revi› talization of  the existing  1,824 houses over the next five years. The Army CVJ team began planning a similar project for Fort Hood, Texas.

Family housing overseas  is  in  even  worse shape and  is,  on  average, 130 years old.  Congress, however, authorized funds in  1996 for CONUS family  housing  only.  Analyses predicted  that  the  Overseas  Housing Authority (OHA) could revitalize family housing and reduce the average age to thirty or forty years. The Army proposed legislation for FY 99 for a pilot OHA program that would operate and revitalize overseas family housing using nonappropriated funds.  If the pilot program  is successful, the Army will transfer all  overseas housing to OHA by FY 03.

The Army  is  the DOD Executive Agent for  all  host-nation- funded projects. In FY 96, Germany contributed $212 million for barracks con› struction  through  the  payment-in-kind  program.  Japan  and  Korea  con› tributed  $1. 1  billion  to  design  and  construct facilities  for  U.S.  service members living in their countries.

## Army Safety Program

With zero Class A aviation accidents in the first six months ofFY 96, the Army National  Guard  achieved a record  of twenty-nine consecutive months  without  a  Class  A  aviation  accident.  The  Guard  flew  919,000 hours  during  these  twenty-nine  months.  The  CSA  awarded  the  Major Army Command Safety Award  to  the Guard for the second time in  five years.

## Army Career and  Alumni Program

The Army  Career and Alumni Program (ACAP)  was  established  in 1990 to counsel active duty soldiers who were separating from the Army, whether voluntarily or involuntarily,  and  to  offer transition assistance  in the form of  career guidance, benefits counseling, and job search guidance. Working with federal  and state organizations, as well  as private compa› nies, ACAP has reduced the  time taken by clients to  find a job, thereby

decreasing unemployment costs to the government.  In 1994, ACAP  was authorized to offer its transition and job search services to other agencies on a reimbursable basis through an outsourcing initiative. The Continuing ACAP Outsourcing Initiative for FY 96 further expanded ACAP's  role. In FY 96, ACAP offered its services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  the  Naval  Surface Warfare  Center  in Virginia,  and  the Military  Traffic  Management  Command,  Eastern  Region.  In  addition, ACAP offered worldwide mobile transition operations in  support of the Navy Selective Early Retirement Program as well as at sea aboard the USS Nimitz battle group transiting from Thailand to  Hawaii. ACAP signed a new agreement in October 1995 with the U.S. Department of  Agriculture and  in  December 1995  opened  a  Career Transition Resource  Center  in support of  that agency.

## Army and  Air Force Exchange Service

The per capita dividend of$239 for every soldier and airman in FY 96 was the highest in the history of  the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). Gross income  for AAFES reached $6.9 billion from  its retail, food, service, mail order, and concession sales. Of  the $348 million profit earned by AAFES, the Army MWR program received $132.9 million.

In response to the difficulty military members encountered in obtain› ing  other than routine eye  exams, including contact lens exams and  fit› tings, AAFES operated its own optical shops in CONUS and contracted for  optical  services overseas.  Eyewear  or exams offered  by contractors, however,  cost customers triple what they would  have paid at an  AAFES optical shop in CONUS. AAFES decided to open four Vision Centers in Germany to offer 45,000 potential customers selections costing one-half to  one-third  what they  would  have paid at contracted optical  shops and with same-day service for standard orders. Optometrists will be licensed in  the  United States and  offer full  optometric care,  while  opticians will hold licenses  from  the American  Board  of Opticianry.  The  first Vision Center is scheduled to open in Heidelberg!Mannheirn in FY 97, with the second opening in Mainz-Kastel  in December 1997. Vogelweh,  where a contracted optometrist will convert to an AAFES hire, will open in sum› mer 1998. The final Vision Center will open in Wiirzberg in 1999.

## Command Information

Despite its  small operating budget and limited staff,  the Hometown News Service continued to have a strong impact on the Army. During the year, it created news releases for daily and weekly newspapers nationwide from 106,083 completed forms outlining the achievements of  Army sol-

diers.  In  support of Operation JorNT  ENDEAVOR,  the  Broadcast Division developed kits  for mobile public affairs  detachments  in  theater to  assist soldiers in  producing holiday  greetings to  their families.  In  the Holiday Greetings television  program, 7,000 service members sent messages on 2,000  one-hour  videotapes  that  the  Broadcast  Division  marketed  and mailed to 980 television stations, reaching more than 48 million viewers.

The  Army  Broadcasting  Service,  which was  managing  four  Army American Forces  Radio and Television  Service broadcast networks and one radio-only affiliate at Fort Greely, Alaska, also supported Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR. As early as December 1995, radio and television service was initiated to Bosnia, Hungary, and Croatia. In January 1996, live radio broadcasting  began  in  Tuzla,  Bosnia,  and,  in  July  1996, in Kaposvar, Hungary.

## Army Postal Operations

In  keeping with the realization that deployed soldiers need to receive their mail swiftly, the first rotation of  postal elements arrived in theater to support Operation JorNT ENDEAVOR on 20 December 1995 and began ship› ping mail the next day.  On 24 December, free mail services were autho› rized to troops, and on 18 January 1996 DOD announced mailing address› es for the Any Service Member program. In the initial period of postal operations from  1 January to 9 February 1996, mail required 8 to 10 days to travel from CONUS to Europe, 2 to 4 days from European military post offices  to Bosnia and  other deployment areas, and 4 to 5 days  to return from the area of  operations to the European post offices. In that same peri› od, Army postal workers handled 988,278 pounds of  mail in theater, with daily averages of 16,268 forTuzla, Bosnia; 6,989 forTaszar, Hungary; and 870 for Zagreb, Croatia.

Although  lessons  learned  from  Operation  DESERT  STORM  did  not result in Modified Table of  Equipment (MTOE) changes in time for JOINT ENDEAVOR, the Army did propose changes in July 1996. The proposed new MTOE for the three active CONUS postal companies was sent to the field for  review  and  will  take  effect  on  16  October  1997.  The  new  MTOE included  requirements  and  authorizations  for  11 Humvees,  5  2 1 2-ton / cargo  trucks,  5  2 12  -ton  shop  vans,  6  1  0,000-pound  forklifts,  4  4,0001 pound forklifts, and  12 portable conveyor belts.

## Army Sports Program

Under  the  aegis  of the  Army's sports  program,  soldiers  have  the opportunity to train and participate in military, national, and international competitions. At the  1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia,

fifty-six  soldiers  in  the  Army  World  Class  Athlete  Program  were  the largest  representation  of Army  competitors  since  1980.  Sgt.  Theresa DeWitt placed fourth in the women's  shotgun double trap event, the high› est placing of any Army competitor during the games.  First Lt.  Michael Thornberry helped the U.S.  handball  team finish  in  ninth place, its  best placing ever.  S.  Sgt.  Derrick Waldroup  and Spc.  Rodney Smith finished ninth  in Greco-Roman wrestling. Other Army athletes qualified and par› ticipated  in  boxing,  track  and  field,  modern  pentathlon,  and  shooting. DeWitt  and  Waldroup  were  named  the  1996 Army  and  Armed  Forces Male and Female Athletes of the Year.

## Army Band Operations

Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR required participation by nearly every ele› ment  of the  Army,  and  bands  were  no  exception.  The  1st  Armored Division  Band  deployed  to  Bosnia  to  support  the  troops.  In  an  era  of downsizing,  the  Old  Guard  Fif e  and  Drum  Corps  converted  from  an attached  platoon with  H  Company,  3d  Infantry  Regiment,  to  a  separate company in 3d Infantry. The  scheduled  inactivation of the  389th Army Band at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was canceled by the com› mander in chief of the AMC. Inactivation of  bands did occur, however, at Fort Riley, Kansas, and Fort Carson, Colorado.

## Special Functions

## Construction, Facilities,  and Real Property

As in previous years, the Army COE fulfilled a critical national role in FY 96. COE personnel participated in sixteen major emergencies,  includ› ing Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR; Hurricanes Bertha, Fran, and Hortense; the Northeast  blizzard;  the  Pacific  Northwest  floods;  the  flooding in North Dakota; and the drought in the Southwest. The COE operated 12,000 mHes of commercial  navigation  channels  and  275  navigation  lock  chambers; maintained 299 deep draft harbors and 627 shallow draft harbors; operated 383  major lakes and  reservoirs;  and  operated  and maintained  75  hydro› electric power plants. The COE built hundreds of  local protection projects, preventing estimated damages of$22.3 billion to property and land. It also operated 4,330 recreation areas at 456 different locations. The COE's Civil Works Program, which operated in every U.S. state and territory, had 396 projects under construction and a budget of  $3.36 billion in FY 96. In one example, COE acquired 388,000 acres in  Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin. Although  50,000 acres were designated for public access, the  remainder will be under developmental control and environmental protection.

Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, COE regulates the discharge of  dredged or fill material into U.S. waters, as well as construction and other work in navigable waterways. In June 1996, COE published new guidelines for nationwide work permits, reducing the amount of  paperwork required, and reviewed requests for thirty-seven such permits.  In  addition,  COE permitted 29,699 activities  under general  per› mits and 38,476 under nationwide permits; approved 5,040 standard per› mits and 3,391  letter permits; and denied 250 permits. The Army  revised the approval and funding process for Dam Safety Assurance Program pro› jects, reducing project approval time to six months by eliminating a review from  the  Major  Subordinate Command  and  lowering approval  authority from DA level to the Chief, Engineering Division, Civil Works.

The 1960 Flood Control Act gave the Army the authority and respon› sibility to compile and disseminate information on floods, flood damage, and flood damage control.  Under the Flood Plain Management Services

Program, COE responded to 32,000 requests in FY 96 from federal  and nonfederal  agencies,  communities,  tribal  nations,  and  individuals  for flood  information. The Army is also authorized to assist states and tribal nations in conserving, developing, and  using water and related resources more effectively. In FY 96, the Army received $1,648,000 as  reimburse› ment for 50 percent of  the cost of  providing such assistance. Two projects in Louisiana to restore and preserve wetlands were completed.

The COE Waterways Experiment Station (WES) remained the largest civil engineering,  environmental  quality,  and information  teclmology research and development lab in DOD. Its DOD Groundwater Modeling System vl.2 was  used  by 210  DOD users, 60 Environmental Protection Agency users,  and  55  Department of Energy (DOE)  users  on multiple DOD and DOE cleanup sites. A  single  use of the  system  at  Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, resulted in savings of  nearly $10 million. WES provid› ed $27.8 million in research and development support for Air Force, Navy, and other DOD agencies on issues of  counterterrorism, weapons effects, structural hardening, and field fortifications.

COE supplied engineering support to sixty non-DOD  federal  agen› cies, states, and local governments to help manage their construction pro› grams and was reimbursed by appropriated funds belonging to those orga› nizations. The projects consisted of  space launch facilities for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, embassies for the Department of State, and  secure facilities  for  the United States Information Agency.  In FY 96, as shown in Table  21, COE helped manage approximately $600 million in construction projects for these agencies.

The Army operates and maintains more than two hundred installations and military communities in CONUS and overseas. Despite the need for modernization of the infrastructure to create and maintain power-projec› tion platforms, funding has decreased. With essential facilities not being replaced, the Army has been forced to spend additional funds  to  operate and maintain aging and deteriorating facilities. In an attempt to rectify this situation,  Congress increased funding  for  real  property maintenance  16 percent, from $1.084 billion to $1.257 billion, between FY 95 and FY 96.

The Army also holds 5,000 leases administered by OACSIM that cost $340 million in  FY 96.  Under an FY 96 lease reduction program called Bold Venture, the Army plans to  decrease costs 30 percent by FY 03  by reducing the  number of leases and  through other measures. Though the FY 98-03 POM reduced lease costs to $306 million, it did not provide funds for moving organizations out of  leased facilities.

At the same time, new lease requirements are created continually in the Army. To support training for Army and Air Force active and reserve forces, COE acquired more than 12,000 acres ofland throughout CONUS. To  improve  family  housing  overseas,  the  Army  obtained  congressional approval  to  lease housing  in  Germany,  Korea,  and  the  Middle  East and began  executing  housing  leases  in  the  Middle  East.  With  the  move  of SOUTHCOM from Panama to Florida pending, COE obtained a lease for 150,000 square feet of  space in Miami for the headquarters building.

To  ensure  that Army  facilities  support  the  power-projection  infra› structure,  the  Facilities  Reduction  Program,  in  its  fifth  year,  eliminates unnecessary or undesirable facilities and retains those that best fit the mis› sion. Under the program, installations must dispose of  one square foot of temporary facilities for each square foot of  new construction. In addition, installations are required to improve their use of  permanent facilities, con› solidate activities in the best facilities,  and dispose of  the worst facilities. In  FY 96, the Army eliminated 5.4 million square feet, for a total of 38.7 million since FY 91.  In the FY 98- 03  POM, no funds were budgeted for excess facilities,  while $100 million per year was earmarked for facility disposal,  further  emphasizing the importance of the Facilities  Reduction Program.

In another effort to save costs and conserve energy, Executive Order 12902, Energy Efficiency and Water  Conservation  at Federal Facilities, established an energy reduction goal of30 percent from  1985 to 2005. By FY 96, the Army had achieved an 18.9 percent reduction overall and a 2.9 percent reduction during the year. The Army provided $44 million in ener› gy conservation projects in FY 96 to help installations improve their ener› gy efficiency.

The Army also established a Utilities Privatization Program to reduce capital investment  costs,  problems  of  ownership,  and  environmental

upgrade responsibilities. By FY 00,  the Army expects to  have privatized all natural gas, electric, water, and wastewater systems except where this will be  uneconomical or adversely affect national security.  Local munici› palities,  regional  authorities,  or  private  utility  companies  will  operate, maintain, and  repair utilities  to regulatory or industry standard in  return for non-federally financed modernization. In FY 96, three utilities at two installations were transferred.

To improve installation repair and minor construction, in August 1996 the  Deputy Assistant Secretary  of the Army (Procurement) authorized a change to the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, expand› ing  the  authority of  installation  commanders  to  approve  Job  Order Contracting.  Job Order Contracting provides delivery of  services or prod› ucts at a predetermined price in  the quantity and at the time specified by the  installation.  In  FY  96,  78  Army  installations  completed more  than $327  million  in  projects  through  this  process.  Before  the  regulatory change, installation commanders could approve contracts up to $300,000, or more if  an emergency condition existed. With the change, commanders arc now able to approve work orders up to $2 million.

The COE is responsible for governing all Army real property and for providing real  estate services for the Army, the Air Force, and other fed› eral  agencies  upon  request. In FY 96,  COE  gave  extensive  real  estate appraisal support to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the DFAS, and the Defense Business Management University.  In  addition,  COE appraised a  land  exchange project at  Fort Bliss, Texas; another at O'Hare International Airport in  Jllinois;  and  the development of the  Engineer Proving Ground  at Fort Belvoir,  Virginia. The  COE saved  $1.3  million  in  lease  costs  by  challenging  rental  rates charged by the General Services Administration.

Real estate appraisal services were also important in the Homeowners Assistance Program, administered by COE, as the Army is the  DOD  Executive  Agent.  Closing  posts  or  bases  under  the  BRAC process sometimes leads to an adverse impact on the real estate market in the neighboring community. When surveys or studies reveal that eligible military or federal civilian employee homeowners are unable to sell  their homes for a reasonable price, the Homeowners Assistance Program pro› vides  financial  assistance. In FY 96,  the program  was  authorized  for Tustin Marine Corps Air Station, California; El Toro Marine Corps Air Station,  California;  Fort Polk,  Louisiana;  Cannon Air Force  Base, New Mexico; and Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York. Following extensive real estate appraisal support by COE that determined market impacts and appraised homes of qualified applicants, the Army acquired 817 homes, purchasing  738 privately  from  homeowners,  at  20 installations in CONUS and Europe. The Army received $96.3 million in FY 96 through

resales of  acquired properties; the funds will be used for future program benefits.

Real  estate appraisal  support was also  important in  Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR.  A  Contingency  Real  Estate  Support Team  (CREST),  com› posed of realty specialists,  appraisers,  and  attorneys  from  within COE, volunteered  for  deployment  to  Bosnia  in  FY  96.  Working  with  the USAREUR Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Engineering, Real Estate Office, the team  acquired  real  estate  and  facilities  for  units  serving  throughout Bosnia; these acquisitions  included  covered storage, maintenance facili› ties, hardstands, administrative space, and troop billets. CREST personnel also prepared the real estate portions of  contingency operations plans and participated  in numerous  exercises  and  conferences in CONUS  and throughout the world.

## Environmental Protection

Under the environmental strategy introduced in FY 93, the Army sup› ported  compliance,  restoration,  prevention,  and  conservation  in  FY 96. Compliance ensures that all Army sites comply with applicable regulations. Restoration  focuses  on  protecting  human  health and  the  environment as quickly as resources permit.  Prevention  involves minimizing all  environ› mental contamination and  pollution.  Conservation consists of protecting and enhancing cultural resources for present and future generations.

In 1996, DOD charged the military services with managing their own environmental restoration programs, removing the responsibility from the Defense Environmental Restoration Account. With full fiscal oversight of its program, the  Army was proactive in programming, budgeting, and exe› cuting cleanup requirements at its installations. At the end of  FY 96, the Army  had  thirty-five  installations  on  the Environmental  Restoration National  Priority  List.  Of these,  twenty-three  were  active  installations, while  twelve  were  scheduled to close  under  the  BRAC  process.  In September 1996, successful environmental restoration efforts enabled the landfill at  Fort  Lewis,  Washington,  to  be  the  first  DOD  installation removed  from  the  National  Priority  List.  The Army  also  petitioned  to remove  the  entire  installation  at  Riverbank  Army  Ammunition  Plant, California, and one site at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Colorado, from  the National Priority List.

For several years, the Army identified and screened potential sites that required environmental cleanup. As of FY 95, 10,486 potential sites had been identified and  l  00 percent of  them screened. A total of 169 sites had been restored environmentally. By the end ofFY 96, due to BRAC actions and a reduction of sites in  the Army inventory,  the number of potential sites was reduced to  10,362, with screening completed at all of  them.

Over the past three years, the Army has improved its resource man› agement of site cleanup  funds.  In  FY 94, only 50 percent of the funds went to  actual cleanup-40 percent went  to  studies  and  1  0  percent to management. Greater efficiency occurred in FY 95, when the amount of funding  available  for  cleanup  increased to  56  percent;  34  percent was used for studies and the remaining 10 percent for management. The Army demonstrated an even better performance in FY 96, with 68  percent of the funds dedicated to cleanup and only 22 percent allocated to studies. The proportion of funds used for cleanup exceeded the DOD goal by 18 percent.

During FY 96, the Army experienced a continuing decline in the num› ber of new  environmental enforcement actions.  Since monitoring of the number of actions began in FY 93,  the Army's new enforcement actions have declined for the third year in  a row  to 221  in FY 96, as compared with 360 in FY 94 and 320 in FY 95. New enforcement actions dropped 31  percent between FY 95 and FY 96, well exceeding the Army's goal to reduce new actions by  10 percent. This success occurred as Army instal› lations  improved  their  awareness  of environmental  responsibilities  and complied with appropriate regulations.

The Army  also  experienced its  third  consecutive  annual  decline  in fines and penalties assessed by  federal  and state regulatory agencies for environmental violations. The 1992 Federal Facility Compliance Act dras› tically  increased  punitive  liability  for  federal  facilities  for  violations  of solid and hazardous waste laws. Monitoring of  the Army's  progress began in FY 93. Although the number of violations and the monetary value of fines  and  penalties  nearly  doubled  from  FY 93  to  FY  94,  a significant decrease occurred in FY 95 and a further decline took place in FY 96. ln FY 93, the Army was assessed $3.7 million for 26 fines and penalties; in FY 94, $6.3 million for 51 fines and penalties; and in FY 95, when a large decline occurred, $600,000 for 2 1 fines and penalties. In FY 96, the Army was assessed $392,454 for  12  fines and penalties, the lowest amount yet assigned and surpassing by 61  percent the Army's targeted goal of  accru› ing  less than $1  million in  assessed  fines and penalties.  In  addition, the Army  agreed  to  perform  supplemental  environmental  projects  costing $2,555,695.

Through  the  Hazardous  Material  Management  Program  (HMMP), installation  commanders  manage  hazardous  materials  throughout  their lifecycle from  procurement through disposal by utilizing the best avail› able  business  practices.  The  program  endeavors  to  reduce  health  and environmental risks as well as comply with federal, state, and local laws. In FY  96, the  Army began  fielding the Hazardous Substance Management  System  (HSMS),  a  standardized  automated  system  that DOD  devised  to manage,  track, and report  hazardous  materials.

Implementation  of HMMP  and  fielding  of HSMS  are  expected  to  be completed throughout the Army by FY 03. In FY 96, the Army had 35 of 144 required integrated natural resources management plans in effect and another 1  09 in progress.

The  Reduction  in  Toxic  Release  Inventory  program  measures  the Army's progress  in  reducing  hazardous  waste.  Progress  is  established using the baseline of2.5 million pounds of  hazardous waste present in the Army  in  1994. The Army's goal is to reduce  its  inventory  to  1 million pounds of  hazardous waste by 1999. The measurement is made at the end of each calendar year,  and at the end of 1995 the Army  had reduced its hazardous waste to  1.74 million pounds, meeting its interim goal for that year of 1.8 million pounds. The cost of  disposing of  hazardous waste was $63  million  in  FY 96,  less  than  the  $7 1  million  in  FY  95.  The Army emphasized pollution prevention to reduce future costs.

In  April  1997,  the  Secretary  of the  Army  Environmental  Awards were  presented. Fort  Eustis,  Virginia, received  the  Environmental Quality  Award for a Non-Industrial  Installation, while  Kwajalein Atoll/Kwajalein Missile Range won  the Environmental  Quality Award for  an Industrial  Installation. The Environmental Quality Award  for an Individual  went  to  Kenneth  P.  Stachiw  at Aberdeen  Proving  Ground, Maryland. Fort Lewis, Washington, was  awarded  the  Pollution Prevention Award  for a Non-Industrial Installation, while  the Pollution Prevention  Award  for  an  Industrial  Installation  was  presented  to  the Corpus Christi Army Depot, Texas. The Project Manager of  the Bradley Fighting  Vehicle  Systems  at  AMC  received  the  Pollution  Prevention Award  for  a  Weapons  System  Acquisition  Team.  Fort  Hood,  Texas, received  the  Recycling Award  for  a  Non-Industrial  Installation,  while Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania, won the Recycling Award for an Industrial Installation. The Recycling Award for an Individual  went to Abdeslem Houmina, also at Tobyhanna Army Depot. The Environmental Cleanup Award  for  an Installation  was  presented  to  Fort Wainwright, Alaska. Newport  Chemical  Depot,  Indiana,  received  the  Natural Resources Conservation Award for an Installation 10,000 Acres or Less, while Fort Carson, Colorado, won the Natural Resources Conservation Award  for  an  Installation  over  10,000  Acres.  The  Natural  Resources Conservation Award for an Individual was awarded to Karl Dautermann, of  USAREUR,  in  Bad  Kreuznach,  Germany.  Fort  Carson  won  the Cultural  Resources  Management Award  for  an  Installation,  while  an employee, Stephen A. Chomko, won the Cultural Resources Management Award for an Individual. In addition, the Army won five of fifteen DOD environmental awards, including both the installation and individual Cultural Resources Management Awards, an Army program adopted by DOD.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

In  FY 96 the Army achieved the highest percentage of  contracts and funds ever awarded to small business prime contractors in the eight-year history  of the  DOD  Small  Business  program.  Out of $27.7  billion  in awarded  contracts,  $8.2  billion,  or  29.5  percent  of all  contracts,  was awarded to small business prime contractors.  In FY 96, small disadvan› taged  businesses received  nearly 9.6  percent of all  contract funding,  or $2.6 billion, surpassing all previous records for that category of  contrac› tor. The Army awarded a larger percentage of funds to the small business program than did any of  the other military services.

DOD  implemented  a  Pilot  Mentor-Protege  Program  to  encourage major DOD prime contractors to serve as mentors for small disadvantaged businesses  and other organizations.  The mentors  will  help  the  proteges develop  their  technical  and  business  capabilities  which,  in  turn,  wiU enable  the  proteges  to  participate  more  fully  in  the  DOD  contractor process.  Mentors  establish  and  implement  a  developmental  assistance plan,  which enables the protege to compete more successfully  for DOD prime  and  subcontract  awards.  DOD  provides  direct  reimbursement  of costs or other incentives for  mentors.  Commercial firms in  the  program resided  in  the environmental  remediation,  manufacturing,  telecommuni› cations, and health  care industries. The Army developed its own Mentor› Protege Program and approved thirty-three mentor-protege agreements in FY96.

As it had in the past, the Army gave monetary support and technical assistance to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)  and Minority  Institutions (MI).  The  Army's  goal has been to provide HBCU/Mls with 5 percent of the total  funds the Army awards to institu› tions  of higher learning.  In  FY 96, for the seventh consecutive year,  the Army  exceeded  that  goal,  awarding  9.4  percent,  or  $28  million,  to HBCU/Mls. In addition, the Army developed several initiatives to support HBCU/Mis,  including  the  creation  on  HBCU/Ml  campuses  of Army Centers  of Excellence designed  to  enhance  long-term  critical  research. The  Army  also  funded  basic  research  efforts  at  smaller  universities through  its  infrastructure  awards  programs and  transferred  excess com› puter and  scientific  equipment  to  HBCU/Mls  to  expand  their research capabilities.

## Legal  Affairs

During FY 96, Army military judges presided over more than  1,200 courts-martial. One-third of  the courts-martial were special courts-martial authorized to adjudge a bad conduct discharge. During FY 96, twenty-one military judges were assigned to  the U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, serving in

six judicial  circuits  located  in  CONUS,  Korea,  and  Germany.  All Army military judges were certified by  the Judge Advocate General to  preside over general courts-martial, and, except for three lieutenant colonels, all were colonels. The number of  reserve component military judges was sig› nificantly reduced during FY  96 to  a total  of nineteen. Reorganization of the reserve component judges allowed for the ability to assign them to all judicial circuits except Korea.

Table  22 depicts the decline in  FY 96,  for the fifth  year in  a  row,  of the  total number  of courts-martial  and  nonjudicial  punishments  as  the number of  soldiers  in the Army declined.

Accused Army personnel are represented before the U.S. Army Court of  Criminal Appeals, the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the U.S.  Supreme Court by Army attorneys within the Defense Appellate Division  in  the  Office ofThe Judge Advocate General  (OTJAG).  In  FY 96, division defense counsel represented 725 soldiers before the Court of Criminal Appeals and  358 soldiers  before the  Court  of Appeals  for  the Armed  Forces. Defense  counsel  also reviewed  courts-martial when required  and  assisted  in  preparing  requests  for  clemency  to  the  Judge Advocate General  and the  Secretary of the Army.  Only one soldier was represented  in  a capital case before the Supreme Court.

In United States v. Loving, division  counsel  represented Pvt.  Dwight Loving  before  the  Supreme Court in  January  1996.  Private Loving,  con› victed  in 1989  of robbery,  attempted  murder,  premeditated  murder,  and felony  murder of two cab drivers,  had been sentenced to death by a  panel of  eight officers. The suit questioned whether it was constitutional for the President, rather than Congress, to prescribe the death penalty and whether a court-martial panel could have  less than  twelve members. The Supreme Court  refused  to  review  the  latter  issue  but  ruled in June  1996  that  the President did have constitutional authority to prescribe the death penalty.

As required  by Presidential  Executive Order and DOD directive, the Joint Service Committee (JSC) on Military Justice conducted the annual review of the Manual for Courts-Martial. The JSC proposed and evaluat-

ed amendments to the  Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial. The President approved change 7 to the  latter in May 1995.  Serving  as  the  DOD  Executive  Agent  for  the  JSC  on  Military Justice,  the  Army  published  and  distributed  the 1995  edition  of  the Manual  for Courts-Martial.

With an effective date of  24 June 1996, the Army signi  fieantly revised AR 27- 10, Militwy Justice. With  respect to  the  nonjudicial  punishment carried  out  by  commanders,  termed  Article  15,  the  revised  regulation authorized such  punishment in  multiservice units, clarified  the statute of limitations, gave guidance for posting punishments, and established appel› late rights more clearly. A commander establishing Article 15 punishment can  reduce  a  soldier  in  rank  by  more  than  one  grade;  in  a  significant change,  the revised  regulation  permits a superior commander to  mitigate that reduction to an  intermediate grade.

Procurement  fraud  has remained  at a constant level for  the  past  five years.  In  FY  96, OTJAG  resolved 540 procurement fraud  cases,  recover› ing  $67  million  through  criminal, civil, and  administrative  cases.  At  the end  of the  year,  I  ,099 cases  remained  open. The number of indictments and convictions dropped, continuing a trend from  previous years;  howev› er, suspensions and debarments remained stable. A significantly profitable case for  the Army  in  FY  96  involved Saft America,  Inc.,  with  whom  the Army  had  contracted  for large numbers  of  lithium  batteries  during Operations DESERT  St-IIELD/STORM. The Army terminated  remaining con› tracts at the end of the war and, several  years later, Saft submitted claims for  reimbursement of high  termination  costs.  Simultaneously, comman› ders in  Bosnia complained  that Saft batteries performed  poorly and  were a safety risk. In June  1996, Saft agreed to fix  500,000 defective batteries and dropped $ 15 million  in termination claims. In another important case, a whistlcblower alleged that FMC Corporation used fraudulent accounting standards and deliberately inflated its research and development costs for the  Bradley  Fighting Vehicle  and  the MLRS.  In  September  1996,  FMC agreed to  pay the government $13  million.

OTJAG, in conducting its mission, defended a wide range of lawsuits challenging the Army's  decisions, programs, and activities, often with mi !› lions of  dollars at stake. In Au Dong Quy v. United States, 28 1  Vietnamese nationals sued  in  1 995  to  recover  lost  wages  for  clandestine operations they conducted during the Vietnam War. The declassification of material pertaining to  the operatives prompted Congress to authorize $20 million to pay each operative $40,000 and an additional $10,000 for any who had been  imprisoned  for  more  than  20 years. Litigation  was  stayed  pending implementation of  the legislation.

As a result of  a  1995 Supreme Court decision that federal  affirmative action programs would  be subject to strict scrutiny,  four lawsuits against

the Army's  procurement program were initiated in FY 96. Under the Small Business Administration 8(a) program, socially and economically disad› vantaged small  businesses sometimes receive preferment in gaining gov› ernment  contracts.  In C. S. McCrossan  Construction  Co. v. Cook, the plaintiff charged that the solicitation of  an Army contract at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico,  under the 8(a) program violated  his  Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. The case was pending at the end of the fiscal year while the other three cases were either dismissed or settled.

A  high  visibility  case  that  was  also  pending  was Brown  (Branch Davidians) v. United States. The plaintiffs claimed that Army and Texas Guard  personnel  and  equipment were  involved  in  the  1993  raid  on  the Branch Davidian  compound in  Waco, Texas. In another important case, Mulloy as Administratrix of  the Estate of  Carol Mulloy  Cuttle v. United States, the plaintiff argued that the Army was responsible for Cuttle's kid› nap,  rape,  and  murder.  In  conducting  its  case, the plaintiff charged  the Army was negligent in  recruiting and enlisting a soldier with a criminal record. Moreover, the suit claimed the Army failed to protect Cuttle from the soldier, did not properly supervise and control the soldier, and neglect› ed to warn Cuttle of  the soldier's  criminal propensity. The court ruled that the Army should have protected Cuttle against third-party crimes, a deci› sion with significant future ramifications for the Army.

Before 1994, the military asked recruits about their sexual orientation, denying them  entry  into  the  service  if they  claimed  to  be  homosexual. Moreover, the services were permitted to conduct investigations to deter› mine a service member's  sexual orientation and to discharge him or her for homosexuality.  In  1994, a  new  policy  was  instituted  that prohibited  the military  from  asking  such  questions  or  conducting  such  investigations unless credible evidence existed that an individual was homosexual. Cases involving homosexuals under the old policy remained in the legal system in FY 96. Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer had been separated involuntar› ily  from  the National  Guard  when  she  admitted she was  a  lesbian.  She filed suit in  1992, and the court, ruling that excluding homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional, ordered her reinstatement in  the Guard in 1994, denying the government's request for a stay. The government sub› mitted  its  final  appellate  brief in Cammermeyer v. Peny in  September 1995,  but the  appeal  was  stayed  pending a decision in an identical case involving  a  Navy  officer.  Cammermeyer  requested  and  was  placed  in inactive status with a mandatory retirement date in March 1996.

Challenges to the new DOD homosexual policy, known as "don't  ask, don't tell,  and don't  pursue," received greater attention. In the  1994 law› suit, Able v. United States, plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of  the new policy. ln July 1996, the U.S. Court of  Appeals held that the new pol› icy did not violate the First Amendment, stating that it maintained a rea-

sonable balance between competing interests, was important to the mili› tary's accomplishment of its objectives,  and  restrained speech no  more than was reasonably necessary. At the same time,  the  court returned  the case  to  the  district  court  to  consider the  constitutionality of  prohibiting homosexual acts in the military.

The outcome of Holley v. United States may have an enormous impact on the Army's elimination of  officers and enlisted soldiers who served in a probationary status, had fewer than six years of  service, and were sepa› rated without a hearing. Because the plaintiff, an Army officer, received a General Under Honorable Conditions discharge and a  discharge certifi› cate with derogatory information, the U.S.  Court of Federal Claims held that the Army's  failure to provide a hearing prior to his separation rendered the discharge defective and invalid. The court ordered the Army to return the plaintiff to active duty, correct his records to show continuous active duty,  and provide him with back pay, allowances, and  benefits. The gov› ernment's appeal  is pending.

Another  case  will  affect  U.S. service  members  serving  with  UN forces.  Spc.  Michael New,  deployed to Macedonia on UN peacekeeping duties, refused to wear the UN headgear and shoulder patch, contending that it was  illegal  to wear the symbols of  a foreign  government and that doing so would make him a member of a UN force and not a member of the U.S. armed forces. In United States ex  rei. Michael New v. Peny, eta/., New requested that court-martial proceedings against him be stayed and that he be removed from the military justice system. New was convicted and sentenced to a bad conduct discharge in January 1996, and his request to  be  removed  from  the  military justice  system  was  denied  in  March. New's  appeal, filed in May, is still pending.

Since passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, civilian lawsuits have been numerous and have centered on discrimination. These trends contin› ued in FY 96, although the number of  lawsuits declined from the previous year. In Greenwood v. West, a class action suit for race discrimination was filed against the Army COE in the Pittsburgh District, Pennsylvania. The allegations  centered on nonpromotion  and  racial  harassment. The court certified  a  class  of approximately  one  hundred  past and present  black wage grade employees. The case was settled under terms acceptable to the plaintiffs, the Army, and the court.

OTJAG also represents the Army in bid protests. In FY 96, the orga› nization  handled  392  appeals,  a  decrease  from  433  appeals  in  FY  95, before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals. OTJAG also rep› resented  the  Army  in 195  bid  protests  brought  before  the  General Accounting Office and 7 bid protests brought before the General Services Board of Contract Appeals.  In  addition, OTJAG reviewed and approved 8,373 payment and performance bonds on Army contracts.

In  a highly  successful  bid  protest  case,  the Appeal  of Mason  &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason  Co.,  Inc., the appellant had been a subcontractor on a  Honeywell  contract  producing MlA1  Abrams  ammunition  in  FY 86. After  determining  that  the  subcontractor  had  supplied  defective  labor costs, a 1991 DOD  audit  recommended  the  price  be  reduced  by $2,468,598. With litigation scheduled in 1996, the appellant agreed to pay the  Army  $1,470,000.  This  amount  far  exceeded  what  the  Army  had expected to recover in  the case and was a higher percentage of  what was due to  the Army than normally obtained from audits on defective pricing. ln a case involving an enormous sum of  money in FY 96, McDonnell Douglas filed two appeals totaling $56 million in connection with a clas› sified contract.  Tn  the Appeal of  McDonnell Douglas Electronics  Corp., the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals ruled in favor of  the gov› ernment  on  one  appeal,  denying  the  appellant's claim  for  $15  million. McDonnell Douglas filed a motion for reconsideration, but it was denied. Trial for the other appeal is set for March  1997.

In  support of the Army's ethics program, OTJAG conducted an Ethics Counselor  Workshop  for  ethics  attorneys  from  all  military  services  in October  1995. The three-and-a-half-day  arumal  program  was  held  for  the second  time at The  Judge  Advocate  General's School  in Charlottesville, Virginia. In  May  1996, judge advocate personnel conducted ethics training in  Hawaii, Japan, and Korea, providing current information on recent legal changes. By the end ofFY 96, OTJAG had processed 377 written and 2,691 oral inquiries; 753 public financial disclosure reports; and 988 confidential financial disclosure reports. The oral and written inquiries addressed issues such as the misuse of  govemment resources and positions, gifts, conflicts of interest, travel gratuities, relations with and support to private organizations, job-hunting, and post-government employment restrictions.

Responsible  for  the  oversight  of  attorney  conduct,  OTJAG also processed  twenty-five  professional  misconduct  inquiries,  slightly  fewer than  in FY 95  and FY 94 and significantly fewer than from FY 87  to  FY 92. Nearly a third of  the inquiries concerned the conduct of  trial or defense counsel.  Seventeen  of the  cases  were  unfounded  and,  of the  remaining eight  cases,  seven  involved  more  than  minor  or technical  violations  of attorney ethical rules. A revision  in  1995 of  the regulation on profession› al  misconduct inquiries  now  requires  that  both a  "substantial  question" and a "credible" complaint must exist before OTJAG conducts a prelimi› nary  screening  inquiry.  In  addition,  The  Judge  Advocate  General  has required that all Army attorneys participate in annual professional respon› sibility training. These two changes have resulted in the significant decline in professional conduct inquiries.

OTJAG  also  represents  the  Anny  in  environmental  legal  issues.  In November 1995, the Army proposed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

revised  management  guidelines  for  the  red-cockaded  woodpecker  on Army installations. The service accepted the revised guidelines with only minor  changes.  Attempting  to lessen  the  impact  of  the  Endangered Species Act on training and to open some restricted land for training, the guidelines centered on enhancing training realism and establishing popu› lation  goals  for  red-cockaded  woodpeckers  on  Army  installations.  In another instance, since June 1995 the Army bad been consulting with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in developing a prototype cul› tural  resources  agreement  to  dispose  of historic  properties  during  the BRAC process.  In May  and  June  1996,  negotiations  on  the  agreement were finalized, enabling installations to comply with the National Historic Properties Act as they divest themselves of  properties.

The Army was involved in numerous lawsuits pertaining to its envi› ronmental  responsibilities. ln a  costly  environmental  case,  the  Army, along with Shell  Oil  Company, agreed  in  December 1995  to pay $48.8 million  to  the  South  Adams  County  Water  and  Sanitation  District  in Colorado  to  provide  water  and  pipelines  for  the  local  community  sur› rounding Rocky Mountain Arsenal.  ln  another case,  the Yakima  Indian Nation sued the Army in September 1995 in an attempt to halt all training at the Yakima Training Center, Washington, alleging that the Army failed to  comply with agreements and  did not have  an integrated cultural  and natural resource management plan. The suit was withdrawn in  April 1996. Additionally,  the National Trust for  Historic Preservation  and Save  Our Seminary  brought  suit  against  Walter  Reed  Army  Medical  Center, Washington, D.C., alleging that the Army failed to preserve and maintain twenty-five  buildings at an annex  even though the Army had adopted a cultural  resources  management  plan  in  1992.  The  court  ruled  that  the National Historic Preservation Act did not demand and could not enforce more vigorous preservation than the Army was conducting.

The Army Claims  Service  provides  a  means  for  compensation  to parties injured by DOD or Army operations, within CONUS or overseas. In addition  to improving  morale  of  service  members  and  civilian employees, the Claims Service assures the goodwill  of other nations by compensating them  for  personnel  or property  damages  resulting  from U.S.  military  operations  and activities. During  FY  96,  the  Claims Service settled 66,900 claims for $84.8 million and recovered $34.5 mil› lion. The majority of the claims,  6 L ,829, were for property damage of $47.9 million10,000 fewer claims and $2  million  less than in  FY  95, due to the reduction of  forces. An additional 5,087 claims were for per› sonal injury totaling $36.8 million. Of  the money recovered, $21.4 mil› lion came from moving and shipping companies and another $12.1 mil› lion  from  medical  care  claims  that  occurred  when  one  soldier  was injured due to the negligence of another.

Engaging in congressional liaison through its Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison (OCLL), the Army in FY 96 received a $3.6 billion addition  to  the  FY  97 Army  budget.  OCLL established the strategy  for presenting the FY 97 Army Budget to Congress by contacting new mem› bers  of Congress,  providing  a  recurring  newsletter on Army  issues  for congressional members, and arranging extensive meetings between Army senior  leaders  and  key  congressional  members  and  staff.  OCLL  also responded  to  35,985  letters  from  congressional  members  on  behalf of their constituents. The  primary  areas of concern remained military per› sonnel issues such as records, awards, financial matters, promotions, eval› uation  reports,  and  assignments.  OCLL  also  carried out  its  mission  of notifying Congress of  Army contract awards costing more than $5 million; in FY 96, 703 such contract notifications occurred.

## Inspector General Activities

The mission of  the IG and the U.S. Army Inspector General Agency is to inquire  into the state of  discipline, efficiency, economy, morale, train› ing, and readiness  throughout the Army.  Of the 2,424 I  GARs submitted during FY 96,  1,146 were requests for assistance and  1,278 were allega› tions.  The  !GARs  were  submitted  by  military  members  (50  percent), unknown sources (34 percent), and civilians (16 percent). The largest per› centage of  the !GARs (29 percent) were concerned with personal conduct, such as sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and nonsupport of  fam› ily. Fifteen percent of  the I  GARs involved conunand/management of  orga› nizations, which included caring for soldiers and family members, storage and shipment of property,  and  exercising  conunand  influence.  Military personnel  management issues such as  recruiting,  reassignments, evalua› tion reports,  promotions,  separations,  and awards  and  decorations com› prised  15  percent of  the  requests.  Nine percent of the IGARs  were con› cerned with  civilian personnel management, including management and employee  relations,  recruitment,  placement,  promotions,  and  awards. Finance and accounting issues, including base pay, allowances, incapaci› tation pay,  and  cancellation of debt constituted 6 percent of the  IGARs. Another 6 percent involved acquisition issues, including policies and pro› cedures, contract administration, contract surveillance, and  competition. Of the  total  number of I  GARs, 60  were  DOD whistleblower cases. The White House referred  l 03  requests to the IG, Congress  166, and senior Army or DOD leaders 53. There were also 540 DOD Hotline requests.

In FY 96, the IG office conducted numerous planned inspections that addressed a broad spectrum of  force  readiness and resource management issues that affected the active and reserve components. Among the divi› sion's high-visibility inspections and assessments were the Task Force on

Extremist  ActivitiesDefending American Values; Private Organizations; and the Demolition of  Iraqi Ammunition at Khamisiyah, Iraq.

The  IG's  Intelligence  Oversight  Division  focused  its  mJssion  on inspections of  Special Access Programs and sensitive activities. The divi› sion developed the first comprehensive inspection schedule of  intelligence units, adding those in FORSCOM, TRADOC, AMC, USAR, and ARNG to  the  inspection  program.  During  its  inspections,  the  division  placed added  emphasis  on  environmental  issues,  financial  management  con› cerns, acquisition activities, property accountability, special security mea› sures, access controls, and the impact of  arms control treaties on the secu› rity of  Special Access Programs.

During FY 96, the IG's  Training Division conducted ten iterations of the three-week-long Inspector General Course. These ten classes graduat› ed 547 students, of  which 274 were officers, 217 were noncommissioned officers,  30 were  Army  civilians,  and  26  were  from  other government agencies.

## Conclusion

Nwnerous events in FY 96  revealed  that the  international  security environment  could  still  be  dangerous  to Americans,  and  particularly  to military  service  members.  Nineteen  airmen  were  killed  when  a  truck bomb  exploded  outside  their  military  compound  in  Saudi  Arabia. Terrorists attacked another Army installation in Saudi Arabia, killing five Americans  and  wounding  another  fifty-four.  When  fighting  began  in Liberia,  four  hundred  U.S.  citizens  needed  to  be  evacuated,  a  mission undertaken by U.S. military forces.

In the face  of these  dangers,  the Army  was  involved in operations around the world throughout FY 96. SF soldiers participated in 850 mis› sions in  over  101  countries. For Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  twenty-two states sent Army National Guard units at the outset; by the end of  the fis› cal year,  139 Army Reserve units were participating.  In  the initial stages of  JOINT ENDEAVOR, Army soldiers facilitated the movement of373 trains and 2,047 transport vehicles, as well as loading 1,408 cargo planes, to sup› ply  24  base  camps.  Of the Army soldiers  already  stationed in Europe, 35,000 were further deployed to Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary. Although JOINT ENDEAVOR had an enormous hold on Army resources and personnel, soldiers  also  supported other worthwhile  missions  overseas,  sometimes for  lengthy  periods. In Haiti,  they  helped  maintain  order,  developed  a security force, repatriated refugees, conducted patrols, and protected food convoys. They also offered humanitarian relief  to Haitians and Cubans and worked  to  settle a  border dispute between Peru and Ecuador. Army sol› diers were an important element in enforcing the two no-fly zones in Iraq, deterring Iraqi aggression,  disabling Iraqi air defenses,  preventing Iraqi retaliatory  strikes,  and  protecting  Kurds  in  northern  Iraq  from  Iraqi attacks.  In  addition,  soldiers  served  in  the  Sinai monitoring  the  Israeli› Egyptian border and as patt of  UN missions in numerous countries.

Continuing a long tradition of  assisting the nation in natural disasters, active and reserve component soldiers participated in numerous emergen› cies throughout FY 96. Floodwaters in Mid-Atlantic states, northwestern states, New York,  and  California necessitated  the  employment of Army personnel to aid victims and stem the rising waters. Total Army elements

supplied airlift capability,  personnel,  and  equipment to  assist  the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia during several major hurricanes. Army troops also suppressed wildfires in Alaska and California and aided Virginia, Maryland, and the District of  Columbia during the  blizzard of 1996.  Following the crash of  TWA  Flight 800 in July 1996, the Army sent 630 active duty soldiers and support equipment to  assist in aircraft and victim  recovery.  Finally, the Army supported the 1996 Summer Olympic Games with a deployment of 10,000 soldiers.

The Army was not able to participate in these deployments, however, without a negative impact on training and readiness. Although Congress authorized additional funds  to  reimburse the Army for  some of the costs of Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR,  approximately 27  percent of those expen› ditures  were  borne by  the Army,  reducing  its  budget for  operations and training.  Moreover,  under  the  Foreign  Assistance  Act,  the  Army  was required  to  provide,  out of its  own  budget and  without  reimbursement, $100 million in equipment to Jordan; $100 million to Bosnia; $10 million to Ethiopia, Eritrea, and  Uganda; $15 million to Liberia; and $76.5 mil› lion to Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and the Eastern Caribbean.

In addition to these operational budget constraints, the days of large procurement  budgets  were  over. Whereas  the  Army  previously  had received $18 billion annually,  by  the mid-1990s this  had declined to  an average of  $7  billion.  With a $7.5  billion budget for procurement in FY 96, the Army began to  focus  on modernization  instead of procurement. Nevertheless,  the  FY  96  budget  did  provide  for  the  purchase  of 60 UH- 60 Black Hawk helicopters, significant modifications for the AH-64 Longbow Apache and the  OH- 58  Kiowa Warrior, extensive  modifica› tions  to  the Army's primary tracked weapons systems, procurement and modification  of diverse  missile  systems,  and  a  large  procurement  of ammunition.

Since the Army budget was  insufficient for all  of its  requirements› contingency deployments, procurement of  needed systems, modernization of old systems,  necessary  training, and restructuringquality of  life for soldiers and families  suffered. The military construction budget focused on upgrading capabilities of  power-projection platform installations, such as  providing modern barracks and computerized training simulators, but was  limited  to  $625  million,  or 57  percent of the  amount expended  on ammunition. Although  the Army's budget for  family housing was set at $1.5  billion  in FY 96, only $118 million  was  available  for  construction, improvement, or planning. Army families  lived in  housing that was,  on average, 63  years old in the  United States and  130 years old overseas, as the  Army struggled to maintain  its  133,000 units and  replace only those that could not be repaired economically. Single Army soldiers fared some› what  better,  however,  residing  in  barracks  that  were  approximately  28

years  old.  With  barracks  renewal  as  the  Army's highest  priority  with respect to facilities, the FY 96 budget authorized $2.3  billion to renovate or construct spaces for 26,000 soldiers at 23  locations in CONUS and 21 overseas.

Restructuring remained a critical piece of  the Army's plan in develop› ing a force ready to face the twenty-first century. Installation closures and realignments required under the BRAC process, troop movements to new installations,  the  division  redesign  initiative  that  resulted  in  an  experi› mental  force  awaiting  warfighting  experiments,  and infrastructure upgrades to improve power-projection platforms were all significant steps toward the creation of  Force XXI. At the same time, the Army reorganized and  developed  new organizations.  The new  Soldier Systems  Command was designed to  view  individual soldiers as systems and to improve their capabilities; the new Operational Support Airlift Command transferred all airlift support missions to the Guard; and the new ODUSA-IA developed policy and implemented Army  international activities  in support of U.S. national  security objectives.  By the end of FY 96,  the Army had accom› plished 97 percent of its required  installation closures in  Europe, 86 per› cent in Korea,  and 30 percent in Panama. The pending withdrawal of all U.S. forces  from Panama by the end of 1999 remained on schedule as the Army transferred properties to the Panamanian government and built new facilities in Miami.

The face  of the Army  continued  to  change.  By  the  end  of FY 96, minorities composed 38.6 percent of  the active force, while women repre› sented  13.4 percent. Married soldiers constituted 66 percent of  the force, creating a  greater  impetus  for  the  Army  to  improve  quality  of life pro› grams, housing, pay, and benefits, as well as to review deployment sched› ules  and  reduce  the time  soldiers spent away from  home.  Having recog› nized  that  a  smaller  force  must  have  high-quality,  trained  soldiers,  the Army  successfully  concentrated  efforts  on  recruitment,  retention,  and reenlistment. Ninety-five percent of  Army recruits were high school grad› uates, meeting the Army's goal.  ln addition, the Army achieved 99.9 per› cent of its  retention and  reenlistment goals.  Higher attrition  than expect› ed, however, forced the Army to review its retention programs to increase its end strength in FY 97. The Army also remained concerned about the 5 percent of its force that was temporarily nondeployable, particularly in an era  of increasing  and  unplanned  crises.  At  the same time,  permanently nondeployable  soldiers  constituted  less  than  1  percent of the  force,  an improvement  from  FY  95.  Virtually  all  soldiers  in  the Army remained high-quality and drug-free-only 0.99 percent tested positive for  illegal drugs. Following the tragic murder of  civilians by soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a study revealed that no widespread or organized extrem› ist activity existed in the Army.

Despite  the  adverse  impact  of a  declining  budget  on  training  and readiness, the  Army demonstrated  its high level of  capabilities  in Operation  JOINT  ENDEAVOR.  Although units and  individuals  had  partici› pated in  training throughout the year, specialized training was conducted prior to their deployment in Bosnia. Individuals received training on mine awareness, checkpoint operations, rules of  engagement, and negotiations, while units participated in CPXs.  In  addition  to testing contingency and deployment plans, the training certified the Southern European Task Force as capable of  extracting UN forces from a hostile environment. In one of the key lessons learned from Operation DESERT  STORM, a comprehensive training program given to those who remained behind, including families, resulted  in 95  percent of  all families  remaining in  theater during deploy› ment. As JoiNT ENDEAVOR settled into a routine, the Army proved its logis› tical capabilities by  providing meals, water, fuel, and supplies for 32,000 soldiers on a daily basis.

The negative  impact of JOINT  ENDEAVOR  on readiness,  however,  was clearly  identifiable  in  the  fully  mission-capable  rates  of five  of sixteen major weapons systems. Although  meeting its  goals for eleven systems, the Army did not meet its goals for the MlA2 Abrams tank; the HEMTT transporter; and the AH- 64, CH-47D, and UH- 60 helicopters. In another indication of  readiness problems, the Army was unable to meet its surface or air transportation goals to Europe or its surface transportation goal to Korea.  Seeking to  increase response time for  its  power-projection force, the  Army pre-positioned equipment for a heavy division in Southwest  Asia and for an armored brigade in Korea.

In addition to procurement of some new systems and extensive mod› ernization  of old  ones,  the  Army  instituted  several  new  programs  to improve its  capabilities.  Information technology,  in  particular, was  used extensively  to  create  total  asset  visibility,  electronic  technical  manuals, radio frequency tags and  interrogators, laser optical cards, turbine engine diagnostics, telemedicine, driver vision enhancements, and satellite track› ing  systems.  During  Operation  JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  total  asset  visibility enabled logisticians to track shipping containers to and in  Bosnia, allow› ing  them  to  locate  supplies,  monitor  cargo,  and  divert  shipments. The Army's velocity management plan guaranteed delivery times and dates for supplies  and equipment to  units,  reducing  administrative  requirements, decreasing stockage costs, and improving delivery times. With  integrated sustainment maintenance, the Army combined active and reserve compo› nent  sustainment maintenance  activities,  which  decreased  repair  times, increased maintenance capacity, and improved maintenance visibility.

Army activities during FY 96 demonstrated clearly that the new world order  would  require  military  vigilance  and  U.S.  military  participation. Although not embroiled in any wars, the Army found  itself  more involved

than  ever  in  humanitarian  and  peacekeeping  operations. In Operation PACIFIC  HAVEN,  Army  personnel  provided shelter, processing,  care,  and security  for  6,600  Kurds  and  others  evacuated  from  northern  Iraq and transported to Guam. SF soldiers became increasingly involved in demi› ning as the U.S. military was required by DOD to improve mine detection and clearing technology, share that technology internationally, and assist foreign nations in developing their own humanitarian demining programs. Army soldiers participated in nation-building programs, such as training Mexican flight instructors and aviation mechanics on the UH- 1 helicopter and transferring UH- 1 helicopters to Mexico to  support its  counterdrug SF units.

In the midst of  building Force XXI, the Army for the twenty-first cen› tury,  the Army  was still  engaged  in  removing vestiges of  the Cold War Almy from Europe. During FY 96, the Army moved 6,500 tons of  ammu› nition, 537 vehicles, and 152 containers of equipment and supplies from Europe to CONUS. As the fiscal  year drew to a close, even though the Army was forced occasionally to look backward, its primary efforts were concentrated on the present or the future. The vigor with which the Army prosecuted all of  its activities in FY 96 bodes well for a better-trained, bet› ter-equipped, and more relevant force for the twenty-first century.
