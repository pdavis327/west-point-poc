## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

Fiscal Year  I 981

## 1.  Introduction

"The Army at Yorktown-Spirit of Victory"  was  a  proud theme for fiscal  year 1981. Numerous commemorative activities were planned and conducted as  both the Army and the nation prepared to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the allied victory over the British at Yorktown;  the celebration was  scheduled for 16-18  October  I  981.  Reaffirmation  of a  proud  past  was  also symbolized on 10 September 1981  when President Ronald Rea› gan, Secretary of  Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, and Mrs. Doug› las MacArthur  dedicated  a  corridor  in  the  Pentagon  to  the memory of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the last of the Army's five-star officers to be so honored.

While honoring past victories and heroes, the Army pushed forward  in  preparing  to  defend,  if necessary,  the  liberties  and freedoms for which so many had sacrificed so much.  In  this re› gard, 1981  was not a year of revolutionary change, but rather a year marked by successes of  a more conventional nature. Priority of effort was  directed  toward  screngthenjng  the  existing force rather  than  undertaking  bold  new  initiatives.  Steady  improve› ment was  made in  recruiting,  equipping, and  training,  familiar but vital areas which constitute the basic measure of force read› iness.

But while  the  Army's achievements  were  more  substantial than spectacular during this fiscal  year, by the close of  the period certain  trends were  evident which  indicated  that an  important turning point had been reached for the Army and for the nation.

There was  a  palpable shift in  attitudes  away  from  the  pre› dominantly negative feelings toward the military which had char› acterized public opinion since the end of  the Vietnam era. T here were  several  components of  this  change as  well  as  other inter› related factors and events which had been instrumental in causing and reinforcing it.

At the beginning of the  fiscal  year,  a  major concern of the American people was the fact that forty-four Americans were still being held as  hostages in  lran. and no immediate resolution of the crisis was in  sight.  The outbreak of hostilities between Iran and  Iraq  in  September  1981  served  to  underscore  further  the vulnerability of  America's vital interests in that region, as did the continued military presence of the Soviet Union in·  Afghanistan. In addition, the emergence of  a  free labor movement in  Poland

and  the  consequent  threats  of Soviet  intervention  heightened political and military turbulence in Europe even more. Tensions were  especially  acute  during  March  and  April  of 1981,  when Soviet forces, together with Czech and East German troops, con› ducted extensive maneuvers near the Polish frontier.

Within weeks  of taking office  in January  1981,  the Reagan administration requested both a supplemental appropriation for the  1981  defense budget and a sharply increased appropriation for fiscal  year 1982. Although public attention was often focused on the debate concerning two  proposed strategic weapons sys› tems-the MX  missile and the  B-1  bomber-the Army's man› power  and  materiel  situation  was  the  subject  of considerable discussion, and much concern was expressed over the adequacy of current draft registration procedures.

On another level, there appeared to be an emerging consensus on the nature of the major threat to the nation's  security. While the public was perhaps most aware of the sheer magnitude of  the Soviet military buildup, a common perception of the Soviets had formed  among influential  members  of the academic and jour› nalistic  communities as  well  as  within  the  nation's civilian  and military  leadership.  The Soviet  Union  seemed  to  exhibit some classic  symptoms of decline:  a  nation  with  an  aging,  inflexible leadership facing a mounting series of  economic and social prob› lems,  together with  many signs of ideological stagnation within the country; and, externally, increasingly uncertain control over its East European satellites. Hence the widely expressed opinion that-following the  usual  historic  pattern of a  troubled  dicta› torship-the Soviet leadership might be more prone to use mil› itary  force outside its  borders to counter internal troubles.

There were also more positive events that helped to shape a new climate of  opinion. The release of  the American hostages in January 1981  resulted in a display of national emotion and unity and an outpouring of patriotism that older Americans compared to the days of World War II.

The nation once again asserted its technological prowess and its  leadership in space exploration in a  manner also reminiscent of  an earlier period-the era of the moon landings of the 1960s. In  November 1980, the first Voyager unmanned spacecraft flew past the planet Saturn, sending back a stunning array of pictures and scientific  measurements.  Then, in  April,  the space  shuttle Columbia made its  historic and successful  first  flight,  opening a new era in the practical use of  space. By year's  end, Columbia was being prepared for a second flight. Finally, in September, Voyager 2 made its  flight  past Saturn,  coming even  closer  to  the great

ringed planet than  its  predecessor and  transmitting even more detailed and spectacular images.

These and other events during the year seemed not only to restore a  sense of unity and purpose to the nation,  but also  to foster  a  return  to  more traditional values  in  American  life,  in› cluding a  feeling of national  pride.  More  than one social  com› mentator expressed  the opinion  that the  national spirit had  at last recovered from  the traumatic effects of the Vietnam expe› rience.

The national mood was reflected within the Army in a num› ber of ways,  not the least of which was a  renewed sense of con› fidence in the future. There were encouraging signs that at least some of the chronic problems and worrisome deficiencies of re› cent years were finally  beginning to yield to persistent and fre› q  uen  tly  imaginative  efforts  at  solution.  Improvement  was especially evident in the area of  materiel, where the largest mod› ernization program since World War II was gaining visible mo› mentum. The first of the long-awaited Ml  Abrams main battle tanks were delivered for  field  tests at Fort Hood, Texas, and a modernized version of the M60 tank continued to be fielded in quantity.  The M60A3, although  regarded as a  transitional sys› tem,  remained  a  formidable  fighting  vehicle  with  a  stabilized main gun,  which  allowed  firing  on  the  move,  advanced  night vision, and gun-ranging  and control devices. Also entering service was  the  UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter, which will  eventually replace  the familiar UH-I  Huey as the Army's principal utility and assault helicopter. Deployment of  an improved TOW (tube› launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) antitank missile to Eu› rope began this year, as did delivery of  the Stinger man-portable antiaircraft missile, which will replace Redeye. Correction of  one of the most critical and long-standing deficiencies in the Army's weaponry was in sight with the production of three new air de› fense  systems:  the  Patriot system,  successor  to  the  aging  Nike Hercules missiles, which went into production in October 1980; the division  air defense gun  (DIVAD),  a  twin  40-mm.  cannon, which will replace the self-propelled Vulcan; and the Roland mis› sile system.  Production decisions were at hand for an advanced attack helicopter and a formidable self-propelled multiple launch rocket  system,  a  weapon  concept  familiar  to  the  Soviets  since World War II but new to U.S. forces.

Important progress was also made in  correcting deficiencies in the organization of  combat forces. These corrections included restructuring the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) to remedy problems encountered during the REFORGER  76 exercise;  acti-

vating new chemical defense units and combat electronic warfare intelligence (CEWI)  units to counter the growing chemical war› fare  threat posed  by  Soviet  bloc  forces  and  to  prepare  for  the modern  integrated  battlefield  environment of the  future;  and completing plans to reorganize I Corps to form the last of three corps to which Army CONUS divisions would be assigned.

In the area of training,  the formal opening of the  National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, on  1 July 1981  was a milestone. This facility provides both the space and the technical facilities to train and evaluate battalion-sized units in a simulated battlefield  environment  of  unprecedented  realism,  including joint training in air-ground operations with U.S. Air Force units.

Perhaps the  most  gratifying progress was  made  in the per› sonnel and manpower areas, where the Army had long struggled with some  of its  most  intractable  problems.  A  combination  of financial  incentives,  quality-of-life initiatives, and aggressive and imaginative  efforts by commanders and service  members at all levels  has  resulted in the fulfillment of recruiting goals;  the re› cruitment of the highest percentage of high school graduates in the history of the  Army,  reversing a  widely  noted  unfavorable trend; and an improved retention situation, with the highest re› enlistment rates of  recent years. Both the new administration and the  Congress  manifested  an  increased  awareness  and  concern about Army manpower issues and the need for supportive meas› ures for improvement.

The favorable developments that have occurred during the past year do not  justify complacency, however, for the Army still faces serious and stubborn problems inherited from a decade of neglect.  Moreover,  the  progress that has  been  achieved  will  in itself create  new  problems and challenges.  Over the  next  five years, some five  hundred new weapon and materiel systems will be introduced into the Army inventory. Many of these will  have a  major impact on organizational structures, training, and logis› tics systems. The pace of modernization will be so rapid that, as Army Chief of Staff Edward C.  Meyer observed, "change itself will be the principal challenge confronting the Army in the years immediately ahead." Yet,  despite the challenges, or perhaps be› cause of them,  there  was  a  new,  positive  mood at  the close  of fiscal year 1981, a growing feeling that the Army's  problems were no longer something that could only be managed, but could be solved.

## 2. Operational Forces

Making appropriate and  timely  changes  within  the  Army's operational forces to adapt their capabilities to new situations was a prominent  guidepost this fiscal year. As summed up by the Chief of Staff,  General  Meyer,  at the end of the year,  the cumulative effect sought through such  changes was  the creation of forces flexible enough to respond to crises worldwide; forces capable of sustained operations under the most severe conditions of the in› tegrated  battlefield,  which  would  involve  the  orchestrated  ap› plication  of chemical,  nuclear,  electronic,  and  modern conventional  weapons;  forces  equally  capable  in  all  lesser  con› flicts;  and  forces  developed  wisely  to make the  best  use  of the nation's resources. Toward this end, several  important changes were  made  or set  in  motion  during  the  year;  future  changes designed to produce the cumulative effect described by the Chief of Staff were proposed in the Army's Program Objective Mem› orandum for fiscal years 1983-1987, submitted to the Secretary of Defense in June.

## Organization and Deployment

To reduce the number of units reporting directly to the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM),  the Army last  year  had begun  grouping active  Army  divisions  stationed  in the  United States under three corps headquarters. Two corps, the III Corps at  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  and  the XVIII Airborne  Corps  at  Fort Bragg, North Carolina, had received divisions at that time. Short› ages of personnel and funds  had forced  the  Army to  delay  es› tablishing the third. In May of this year, the Department of the Army directed FORSCOM to establish the additional headquar› ters by reorganizing the I Corps, which in March 1980 had been reduced to zero strength after many years of  operations in Korea. The corps was to be reorganized at Fort Lewis, Washington, on 1 October 1981  under the command of Lt. Gen. John N. Bran› denburg, with  its headquarters company to be furnished by the active Army and its other headquarters elements by the reserve components. The corps command was to include Fort Lewis, the 9th Infantry Division stationed at Fort Lewis, and other units as determined by FORSCOM after the corps was fully operational. Once established, the I Corps was  to conduct contingency plan-

ning in support of the Eighth Army in Korea and the U.S. Army Western Command (WESTCOM) in Hawaii. It was also to serve as a  late-deploying corps for NATO.

Among internal changes affecting active Army divisions was a  complete  restructuring  of the  101st  Airborne  Division  (Air Assault).  During REFORGER  76, the eighth annual strategic mo› bility exercise to test U.S. and NATO plans and procedures, this division  had  introduced  the  airmobile  concept  to  the  training series when it deployed to Europe, transporting its personnel by air and its equipment by sea.  Deficiencies noted in the airborne unit during that exercise prompted an  extensive study and de› velopmental process by which the U.S. Army Training and Doc› trine  Command  (TRADOC)  produced a  new  table  of organization and equipment O-Series) for the division. The new table was designed to improve and modernize the division's for› ward support, communications, transportation, artillery, and an› tiarmor and air defense capabilities and thus dramatically increase its fighting capability and sustainability.  But FORSCOM became concerned that weight and size factors inherent in the table would adversely affect the division's  ability to deploy and recommended that the table be tailored to eliminate the potential problem. The Department  of the  Army  approved  the  recommended  adjust› ments, and the division was formally reorganized under the mod› ified table  in  September.

In  connection  with  the  High  Technology  Test Bed  project involving  the 9th Infantry Division  at Fort Lewis,  the Chief of Staff approved the fielding of  an air cavalry attack brigade with the division for  testing and concept evaluation.  FORSCOM ac› tivated the brigade and two attack helicopter battalions in June. The evaluation of the brigade's performance will  be used in de› termining whether the air cavalry  concept could be applied to other divisions.

In the continuing effort to upgrade the armament and fire› power of divisions,  the  Army  made  changes  in  the artillery  of the 2d Infantry  Division  in Korea. Two of the division's direct support battalions exchanged their  105-mm. towed howitzers for 155-mm. towed howitzers and modernized ammunition. Its gen› eral support battalion,  which had been  a  composite  unit  using both 155-mm. towed howitzers and 8-inch self-propelled howit› zers, became a standard divisional 8-inch self-propelled battalion. The  division's remaining  direct  support  battalion  will  receive 155-mm. towed howitzers next year, at which  time the division artillery's weapons  will  total  fifty-four  155-mm.  howitzers  and twelve  8-inch  howitzers.  In  another  upgrading step,  the Army

activated a  combat electronic warfare inteJligence  (CEWI)  bat› talion for the 2d Division in September.

Near the end of this fiscal  year, President Reagan imposed a $13-billion reduction on planned military spending over the next three years. As part of  the effort by the services to accommodate the cut, the Army would reduce the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord,  California,  to  cadre  status,  or  by  about  8,000 spaces,  in fiscal year 1983. This cut in spaces would, in effect, protect Army equipment modernization programs against reductions. Accord› ing to plans, the division would be restored to its original strength in fiscal  years  1986 and  1987.

Last year,  the  multiservice  Rapid Deployment Force  (RDF) was  established  at  MacDill  Air  Force  Base,  Florida,  as  a joint headquarters under a  Marine Corps commander, who was sub› ordinate to  the  U.S.  Readiness  Command and  its  Army  com› mander.  Under the supervision  of the  Army  commander,  the RDF would  prepare  to  respond  to  contingencies  threatening American interests in Southwest Asia. Designated units of  all four services could be placed under RDF command if needed.  Con› siderable  controversy  over  whether a  force  so  constituted  was workable led to a decision by the Secretary of Defense this year to  make the RDF a separate unified command and to establish it in  or near the Persian Gulf area. He originally scheduled the change to take place over the next three to five years, but in June he shortened the transition period to eighteen months.

In presenting his  vision  of the Army of the 1980s last year, the Chief of  Staff, General Meyer, stressed that "developing co› hesive units over time must be the central focus" of the Army's manpower efforts.  Toward that end,  the  Army  took steps  this year to reduce personnel turbulence and its deleterious effect on unit stability by moving toward a unit replacement system instead of the existing individual  replacement system.  The change was essential,  the  Chief  of Staff emphasized, if the  Army  was  to achieve  its  readiness goals.

To test the unit system, the Army began forming special com› panies under Project COHORT (cohesion, operational readiness, and training).  As  planned,  individuals  would  be  recruited  spe› cifically for each  of these companies and would train and serve together as a unit for the duration of  their three-year enlistments; each company would retain the same commissioned and noncom› missioned  officers  throughout  the  three  years.  After  at  least eighteen months in the United States, the COHORT companies would  move overseas as replacement units and there serve the remainder of  the period. By the close of  this fiscal year, the Army

had formed twenty COHORT companies, all of which were still in  training. Their movement overseas was scheduled to begin in fiscal  year  1983.

Taking a much broader approach to improving unit cohesion and stability as  the COHORT project got under way,  the Chief of Staff directed  a  special  task  force  to  produce  a  regimental system  under which infantry, armor,  field  artillery,  air defense artillery, engineer, and aviation battalions would be assigned  to regiments  at  permanent  home  bases in the  United  States  and thereafter  would  serve  alternating  tours  of duty  between  the home bases and overseas stations. Such a system would resemble the British regimental system and, in effect, would be an exten› sion  of the  Army's Combat  Arms  Regimental  System  (CARS) introduced in  1957.  The target date set for putting the system into operation was  1 October 1982.

Having some bearing on the prospective regimental rotation and replacement system was a new organizational standardization policy  for  similar  MTOE  (modified  table  of organization  and equipment)  units  placed  in  effect  in  February.  Organizational standardization,  which  had  previously  been handled  independ› ently  within  each  major  command,  must  now  be  done  on  an Armywide basis and must conform to precise  levels  of the  ap› propriate base TOEs. Any modifications must have the approval of Headquarters, Department of the Army.  The advantages of the  new  policy  include  the  establishment of a  single  readiness standard  for  similar  units,  improved  management of the  pro› curement and distribution of  resources, and the proper  alignment of the units for rotation and replacement under the regimental system.  Ground combat units were the first  to be standardized under the  new policy.  The entire  process should be completed by fiscal  year  1985.

Affected by changes as a whole has been the Military Police Corps,  whose structure during the past four years  has  been re› duced by 1,995 spaces. Because of this substantial loss,  the Army has had to make changes in organizational and operational con› cepts in order to maintain an effective military police force em› phasizing the combat support  role. With further space reductions scheduled for the corps during the next five fiscal years, the Army has programmed structural changes that will increase the number of combat support forces through the reorganization of  special› ized combat service support and general support units.

## Europe and the Middle East

The significant challenge to U.S. security posed by the USSR has  been  sustained  in  Europe  by  a  decade  of enlargement,  re› organization, and  vigorous  modernization among Warsaw  Pact forces.  They have  emerged from  this decade of change with  a more balanced structure for conventional warfare and with both conventional and nuclear firepower greatly increased.

Among NATO forces facing the Warsaw Pact contingents at the end of  this fiscal  year were 208,948 members of U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR). Under the command of General Frederick J.  Kroesen, these troops were assigned to two corps-each com› posed of two  divisions  and  one armored  cavalry  regiment-to four separate brigades, and to a complement of combat support and combat service support organizations. As evaluated by Gen› eral  Kroesen before the Senate Subcommittee on Preparedness of the Committee on  Armed Services in  February,  these  units satisfactorily  met  readiness  standards.  They  were  adequately manned  at  current  authorized  levels;  were  well  equipped,  al› though not with all the products of  modern technology; and were well  trained. But he pointed out an important limitation.  While his command could "initiate effective and successful combat op› erations to  defend  the  NA  TO sectors assigned"  to  it,  it  was  a "high risk  force"  not  manned at wartime strength,  lacking re› serves and without sufficient support forces to guarantee its stay› ing power. Beyond that, and as a  matter of greatest concern, he said  that  "the  inadequacies  of troop  housing,  the  shortage  of family housing, the makeshift, unsatisfactory, unhealthy working conditions for  large  segments of the command,  the  exorbitant backlog of maintenance and  repair projects all  contribute  to a cancerous drain on the morale and commitment of the force as a  whole."

Reflecting  General  Kroesen's assessment,  the Army contin› ued to increase USAREUR manning levels in logistical elements this year. It allotted 1,500 more spaces for combat service support units and programmed the activation of fifty-five  additional  lo› gistical  units.  The filling  of pre-positioned  materiel  configured to unit sets (POMCUS) reached a new high with the addition of a  fourth  division  set in  the  Northern Army Group.  POMCUS eventually  will  consist of seven  major packages:  enough  sets  to eliminate current shortages in the combat support and combat service support required by forward deployed forces and six di› vision sets.

ln 1978  USAREUR developed  the concept of "US  Army, Europe-An Army Deployed (UAD)," the objective of which is to have the command become a field army deployed at the highest possible level of  combat readiness. The main features of the con› cept  include  relieving  USAREUR  of peacetime  base  support functions,  placing  troops in  rehabilitated and modernized facil› ities,  and  acquiring  additional  facilities  as  needed,  all  to  be achieved  primarily  through  German  host  nation  support.  But while  the  Germans  this  year indicated a  willingness  to  provide wartime  host  nation  support,  they  showed  little  inclination  to favor  the features of UAD.

REFORGER 81, the thirteenth in the series of  annual strategic mobility  exercises,  took  place  in  September as  part of the  AU› TUMN FORCE series of NATO multinational readiness exercises. Designed in  part to provide experience in  deploying reinforce› ments  to Europe,  the  RFORGER  exercise  this  year  involved  the movement  of approximately  15,000  Army  troops  from  the United States.  Deployed units included elements of the  4th  In› fantry  Division  (Mechanized), a  brigade of the  1st Infantry Di› vision  (Mechanized),  a  brigade  of the  7th  Infantry  Division,  a battalion  of the  9th  Infantry  Division,  a  battalion  of the  38th Infantry Division  (Indiana ARNG), a  company of the 82d Air› borne Division, six  tactical operations center groups, and about thirty combat support and combat service support units of both the active Army and the reserve components. The bulk of these units  deployed  personnel  only-these  by  air-and  received POMCUS equipment in  Germany. The remainder moved  per› sonnel by air and equipment by air and sea.  On arriving in Eu› rope, the units  moved through four aerial ports of debarkation and two seaports of debarkation to exercise positions previously determined in  connection with  wartime plans.

Over 50,000 USAREUR troops participated with the forces deployed  from  the  United States  in  three joint and  combined exercises. Exercise CERTAIN ENCOUNTER was a field training ex› ercise in  the central and  eastern  parts of the Federal  Republic of  Germany involving more than 70,000 NATO personnel; Ex› ercise CARRIAGE CLOCK  was a command post exercise involving about 8,000 NATO personnel; and Exercise SCHARF£  KLINGE was a  field  training exercise in  the  Black  Forest involving over 20,000 NATO personnel.  Altogether the forces of NATO na› tions participated in twenty-eight exercises.

As  the first of the  NATO exercises was  getting  under way, terrorists  attempted  on  15  September  to  assassinate  General Kroesen while he, accompanied by  Mrs.  Kroesen, was en  route

by automobile  to  his  headquarters  in  Heidelberg.  The general and Mrs. Kroesen suffered minor cuts when an antitank grenade, fired  from  a  nearby wooded hillside,  exploded  in  the  trunk of the automobile and shattered the rear window. The assassination attempt was  the tenth attack made on American personnel and installations in  West Germany in  1981. Suspected of making the attacks  was  the Red Army Faction,  a  left-wing  terrorist group. It was also possible that the acts of terrorism involved a militant peace movement which had been spurred by reports of NATO plans  to  deploy  a  new  generation  of American-made  nuclear weapons in  western Europe.

In  November,  forces  designated for  the  Rapid  Deployment Force participated in a training exercise in Egypt. Called BRIGHT STAR,  the exercise involved some  1,400 troops,  including more than  900  men  of the  10 lst  Airborne  Division  (Air  Assault),  a New Mexico Air National  Guard A-7  attack aircraft unit, and members of the RDF headquarters. The RDF commander, Lt. Col. Paul X. Kelly of  the U.S. Marine Corps, was in overall charge of the exercise.  Deploying from  Fort Campbell,  Kentucky,  the home station of the  101st Airborne Division,  were  the  1st Bat› talion, 502d Infantry; part of one troop of the 17th Cavalry and of one company of the  101st Aviation  Battalion; and a  mix  of support elements. Also deployed from Fort Campbell were UH60A Black Hawks, the Army's newest troop transport helicopter; AH-IS TOW  Cobras;  and  OH-58  Kiowa  scout  helicopters. Forty-five flights by C-5A and C-141 transports were needed to move the troops and equipment to Egypt.  Egyptian troops were integrated into American units for the exercise, which  included air assaults, day and night attacks,  and defensive operations.

At the Army's request, the Office of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff began  to develop plans for  acquisition of basing rights and for related  construction  in  Southwest  Asia  for  the  years  1985 through  1987.  Congress,  in  the  meantime,  allocated  funds  to support military construction planning in  fiscal year 1982 for an RDF base at Ras  Banas, on the  Red Sea coast of lower Egypt. Such  planning  will  further  involve  the  Corps  of Engineers  in Middle East projects.  In support of the  RDF  this  year,  the en› gineers established an area office in Oman. At the beginning of next fiscal  year,  they  will  establish  an  area  office  in  Egypt  to support the  RDF  base  at Ras  Banas,  if construction  funds  are appropriated.

In another step taken this year to support Army, Air Force, and Marine elements of the RDF, equipment and supplies were loaded on ships for deployment to the Indian Ocean. These items

included  ammunition,  wheeled  and  tracked  vehicles,  artillery, food,  and  medical  supplies.  Some  of the  vessels  were  of the lighter-aboard-ship (LASH) type, carrying loaded barges in their compartments. These barges could be pulled ashore by tugboats, which  were also carried aboard the LASH ships.

The Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty (Camp David accords) signed in  March  1979 called for a  United  Nations peacekeeping force to be established as a  buffer in  the eastern regions of the Sinai Peninsula during the final  phase of the Israeli  withdrawal from the peninsula in April  1982. But the U.N. Security Council, an› ticipating a  Soviet veto  of a  United  Nations  force,  indicated in May of  this year that it could not provide the force. This situation led to trilateral negotiations among Egypt, Israel, and the United States,  which  resulted  in  a  decision  to establish a  multinational force  and observers (MFO) for the mission.  As  programmed in July,  the U.S. contribution to the force will  be 1,164 Army per› sonnel constituting an infantry battalion task force and a logistical support element for the entire MFO. The United States would also  provide  thirty-six  military  personnel  for  duty on the MFO staff.  By  the  end  of this  fiscal  year,  other  nations  agreeing  to provide forces included Fiji and Colombia, each of  which offered a  500-man  light  infantry  battalion,  and  Uruguay,  which  con› sented to contribute a 70-member transportation company. Stem› ming from  provisions  of the  earlier  Camp  David  accords,  the Army Corps of Engineers meanwhile established the Sinai Con› struction Management Office in  preparation for building facili› ties for the peacekeeping force on the peninsula.

A highlight of the year for the entire nation was  the release in January of the Americans held against their will in Iran since November 1979. In anticipation  of the release of the hostages, each military service had worked closely with the others and with the  Department of State  to develop a  reception  plan by  which its  returning members could be given immediate  medical  care and  administrative support and could be rapidly reunited with their  families.  Under  the  prepared  plans,  the  U.S.  Air  Force Hospital located  in  Wiesbaden,  Germany,  handled  the  medical processing. From there, the returning Americans were flown to Stewart Air  Field at  Newburgh,  New  York,  and  then  taken to the  U.S.  Military Academy at West  Point for a  private reunion with immediate  family  members.  Following that occasion,  they were flown to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, for an official welcoming ceremony.  Military members of the group were then released to their respective services and, after further processing, were placed on leave.

## The Pacific and Far East

In assessing the military situation in Korea near the beginning of  this fiscal year, General  John A. Wickham,Jr.-who since 1979 has  been  the Commander in Chief, United Nations Command, ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command; the Commander of  U.S. Forces, Korea; and the Commander of the Eighth Army-stated his  belief that "the forces  we have in place here, plus those that are  planned  for  reinforcement,  are  capable  of defeating  any North Korean attack."  He acknowledged  the substantial  capa› bilities of the North Korean armed forces:  they had three times the  number  of tanks  possessed  by  the  combined  ROK-U.S. forces;  twice as much artillery, most of which had longer range; twice the number of armored personnel carriers; twice as many aircraft;  and four times the number of  ships; and they had sub› marines, which  the ROK Navy did not.  Further, the North Ko› reans were  continuing  to  build their armed  forces  in  terms  of quality and somewhat in size. He nevertheless estimated that his combined forces,  augmented as  planned,  could win  the  battle, and without  resorting  to  tactical  nuclear  weapons.  His  forces, too, he pointed out, were being steadily improved.

For six years, ROK and U.S. forces have participated in com› bined training under the TEAM SPIRIT series of exercises.  This year's  exercise was the most  comprehensive yet  staged. It  involved more than  160,000 ROK (Republic of Korea) and U.S.  troops, including nearly 30,000 U.S. participants deployed from outside Korea.  Five  divisions  maneuvered  against  each  other as  units practiced  defense  against  chemical  warfare,  sophisticated  elec› tronic jamming, live-fire air-to-ground and air-to-air maneuvers, and amphibious operations. As summed up by General Wickham, "TEAM SPIRIT  is  an  essential  training tool to improve  our op› erations, logistics, interoperability of forces and interservice co› ordination.  It  helps  assure  that  our  forces  would  not  have  to respond to the real experience of combat on an ad hoc basis."

At the end of  the year, the combined forces in Korea remained at a  high  state  of readiness.  The  Republic  of Korea  was  com› pleting one program to raise the quality of its armed forces and had  established  a  five-year  plan  for  making  further  improve› ments.  As  the  fiscal  year  ended,  the  Eighth  Army  numbered 25,808 members, about 15,000 of  whom were in the 2d Infantry Division.  Also  in  the  division  were  some  2,100  South  Korean troops, who had b~en provided under the Korean Augmentation to the  U.S.  Army  (KATUSA) program, which  dated from  the early days of the Korean War.  Besides the upgrading of  artillery

and the organization of  the CEWI battalion in the division during the year, it was now scheduled to exchange its gunship helicopters for the newer S-model Cobras. The division was somewhat light in  strength  because  of the  loss  of two  battalions  when  a  with› drawal of the entire division was begun during President Jimmy Carter's administration.  The withdrawal  was  subsequentJy can› celed, and President Reagan has announced that the U.S. forces in Korea would be increased over the next two or three years.

With  the  objectives  of improving  plans  for  operations throughout the Pacific and increasing the capability of  the Army to go to war in  that region, the Department of the Army Pacific Operations-Logistics  Conference convenes  periodically,  usually annually,  to consider a  wide  range  of operational and  logistics issues. Courses of  action are decided on the spot where possible, and specific tasks are assigned to commands for longer-term ac› tions. This fiscal year, the Commander, U.S. Army Western Com› mand,  hosted  the  conference  at  Fort  Shafter,  Hawaii.  lt  was cochaired  by  officials  from  the  Office  of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff  for Operations and Plans and the Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Logistics and was attended by  representatives of all major Army commands in the Pacific,  U.S.  Army Materiel De› velopment  and  Readiness  Command,  and  U.S.  Army  Forces Command.

The Army expanded its contacts with the Japan Ground Self› Defense Force QGSDF) during the year. At the ninth in a series of logistics talks,  Army representatives gave their  Japanese coun› terparts  the  latest  information  regarding  the  Army's wartime standard  support systems  for  foreign  army  forces  and  briefed them  on  rationalization,  standardization,  and  interoperability. The Japanese valued  these  talks as  a  means of maintaining the prestige of the JGSDF vis-a-vis the U.S.  Army and as a source of information  useful  in  improving  their  defense  force.  In  other contacts,  mainly  through  U.S.  Army, Japan,  but also  involving WESTCOM and FORSCOM, JGSDF members participated on a  bilateral  basis  for  the  first  time  in an  Army  command  post exercise,  GOPHER  BROKE X, for the defense of  Japan. An Army -JGSDF Military History Conference held in July was another first. The principal  participants  were  members  of the  Army's Command and General  Staff College Combat Studies Institute and their counterparts from the faculty of the JGSDF Staff Col› lege. Covered at the conference were the experiences of the Jap› anese  Army  in  fighting  Soviet  forces  during  the  Nomonhan border incident in 1939 and the Manchurian campaign in  1945. In addition, the conferees developed the basis for future dialogue

between  the Army and the JGSDF on ground tactical  issues  of current importance in  Northeast Asia.

For the first  time in  more than thirty years, an official  U.S. defense delegation  composed  exclusively of military personnel, half of whom were Army members, traveled to China in May to visit schools and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The goals of the  visit  were  to  learn about the  Chinese military  education  and  training  system;  to  exchange  views  on strategy, doctrine, and training; and to assess the potential value of  future contacts. Visited schools included entry-level Army, Air Force, and Navy schools; an Air Force technical college; a military medical college;  mid-level  Army schools; and the PLA military academy. Units on the itinerary included an infantry division and elements of the  East Sea  Fleet.  The visit  was  of particular sig› nificance  because  it  provided  U.S.  military  personnel  with  ex› tensive access to leading members of the PLA. If  sustained, such contacts  may  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of the  re› quirements of a  modern battlefield, especially as these relate to the Soviet threat.

## Western Hemisphere

The  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command,  headquartered  at  Fort McPherson,  Georgia,  and  commanded  by  General  Robert  M. Shoemaker, remained the largest of  the Army's  major commands. Its primary mission was  to organize, equip,  train, and  maintain the combat readiness of assigned units and soldiers in the event of their  mobilization  and  commitment.  Included  in  its  mission was  the supervision of the  training and  readiness of the Army National Guard.  In addition,  General Shoemaker served as  the component commander of all  Army  forces  designated  for  de› ployment to the U.S. Readiness Command and, for planning pur› poses,  as  commander of any Army forces assigned to  the  U.S. Atlantic Command.

Assigned to FORSCOM were forces of the active Army and U.S.  Army  Reserve  located  in  the  continental  United  States (CONUS), Puerto Rico, Alaska, the Virgin Islands, and Panama. The year-end authorized strength of its active Army forces was 278,200; that of its U.S. Army Reserve forces was 256,815; and the Army National Guard forces supervised by FORSCOM num› bered 424,400.  The  active  Army  forces  included  3  armies,  3 corps,  IO  divisions,  3 separate infantry brigades, 1 armored bri› gade, I  air combat cavalry brigade, 1 armored cavalry regiment, and  numerous separate  combat,  combat support,  and  combat

service support units. The U.S. Army Reserve units included 19 U.S. Army Reserve commands, 28 genera I officer commands, 12 training divisions,  3 separate infantry brigades, and 2  maneuver area commands.  The National  Guard forces  under supervision constituted 8  divisions,  22 separate brigades, 4 armored cavalry regiments, and 16 other major units.

Last year, the Army rated six of  FORSCOM's  ten active Army divisions as  not being combat ready.  As  a  result of advances in manning, equipping, and training, all ten divisions at the end of this  year were pronounced "capable of deploying or executing their  operational  contingency  missions."  So,  too,  were  FOR› SCOM's five separate brigades and its armored cavalry regiment.

FORSCOM's three  armies-the  First  U.S.  Army  at  Fort George G.  Meade, Maryland; the Fifth U.S.  Army at Fort Sam Houston, Texas; and the Sixth U.S.  Army at the Presidio of  San Francisco,  California-commanded  and  trained  assigned  U.S. Army Reserve units and supervised the training and readiness of the Army National Guard, which it did through nine subordinate U.S. Army readiness and mobilization regions, each of which was commanded by  an active  Army  general  officer.  These regions were further subdivided into twenty-eight readiness groups, each of  which provided assistance to assigned reserve component units. This year, special programs to improve readiness in  the reserve components were reinforced and new ones initiated with the aim of  overcoming lagging strength levels among reserve component units.  T hese actions along with an improved reserve component recruiting climate,  brought about by  Selective Service  registra› tion requirements and worsening economic conditions, produced a  substantial  increase  in  reserve  component strength.  This  de› velopment  was  especially  noteworthy  considering  that  in  the event of total mobilization, the reserve components were sched› uled to provide some 53 percent of  the Army's  combat battalions, 65 percent of its deploying forces, and 60 percent of  its logistical and combat service support units.

In  addition  to  their  normal duties,  the commanders of the First U.S. Army and Fifth U.S. Army functioned in a special chain of  command reaching from FORSCOM headquarters to the ref› ugee processing centers established last year to handle the massive influx  of Cubans that had  begun in April  1980.  At the end of last year,  about 10,000 refugees remained at the center at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, which  had become the single facility for han› dling  them.  This  year,  the  Cuban  population  at Fort Chaffee declined to around 500, but the illegal alien problem was exac› erbated by  the  arrival  of Haitians  in  southern  Florida.  Called

upon  to  provide  facilities  for  detaining the  Haitians,  the Army made available to the Immigration and Naturalization Service a former air defense site,  Krome North, in  southern Florida and Fort Allen  in Puerto Rico.

## Chemical and Nuclear Matters

Concern over the disparity between U.S. and Soviet chemical warfare capabilities, with the Soviet Union having a decided edge, has led the Army to make concerted efforts to upgrade both its defensive and offensive capacities.  As  set by  the Chief of Staff, "the  Army's objective  with  respect  to  chemical  warfare  is  to achieve both a credible retaliatory capability and a defensive pos› ture  which  would  deter  enemy  use  of chemicals  against  U.S. forces and our allies."

In  raising  the  level  of chemical  defense,  the  Army  has for obvious reasons given priority to equipping its  forward combat forces and those  forces scheduled to be deployed early from the United  States  in  the  event  of a  crisis.  Chemical  defense  units activated this year included three NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) companies to support the 4th Infantry Division (Mech› anized), the 9th Infantry Division, and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). These additions raised the number of NBC com› panies  in  the  Army  to  twelve.  Other  units  that  were activated included a chemical (smoke) battalion, the first such battalion to be  in  the active  force  since  1973,  and  four  smoke  companies. Small NBC decontamination and reconnaissance teams were also activated to support. separate brigades and armored cavalry reg› iments. In continuation of  a program begun last year to establish NBC defense expertise in  all  types  of units,  a  chemical  officer (lieutenant) was added this year to the TOE of  each field artillery battalion, as  had already been done for infantry and armor bat› talions.  The total  number of chemical  specialists  authorized  in the Army grew  from  3,600 last  year to 5,600 this  year and is programmed to reach 9,800 by fiscal year 1987. The U.S. Army Chemical School at  Fort McClellan,  Alabama,  increased  its en› rollment this year to more than  3,000 students.

Besides such chemical defense improvements in force structure and training,  the Army,  as  pointed out by  the  Chief of Staff, needed  to  acquire  "adequate  war  reserve  stocks  of protective clothing and equipment and develop new items which will reduce the  operational  degradation  associated  with  protective  ensem› bles."  Required items included more efficient decontamination devices,  more  sensitive  alarms,  more  effective  antidotes,  and

cooler and less cumbersome protective clothing. Fielded this year was  an  improved  personal  decontamination  kit,  the  M258Al, which  was  simple to use  and also  provided the means for  facial decontamination. About 100,000 of the new kits were issued to the forces in Europe and to early deploying forces in the United States.  An in-process review of  a  new chemical agent alarm, the M8Al,  that  was  more sensitive  resulted  in  a  recommendation that it be accepted as standard equipment. From another review came a  recommendation, which the Army staff supported, that new  chemical-agent-resistant  coatings  be adopted as  a  topcoat for mobile tactical equipment and other selected materiel. Plans call for the application of  the coatings first to developmental items and next to fielded equipment.

Last year, the Surgeon General of  the Army discontinued the use  of TAB-a mixture of oxime, TMB4 atropine, and benac› tyzine-as the chemical nerve agent antidote in  favor of  a com› bination of  atropine and oxime. TAB was dropped because it did not contain enough atropine and oxime and because it was itself incapacitating. This year, the TAB antidote was withdrawn from Army units, the fielding of  a new atropine autoinjector was com› pleted, and  the  fielding  of the oxime component as  a  separate autoinjector was begun in  Europe.

In an  effort  to  improve  protective  clothing,  the  Army  has developed a  camouflaged overgarment designed with  the same woodland pattern as the battle dress fatigue uniform. Plans call for its adoption next fiscal year. In search of even better protec› tion, the Army funded an accelerated exploratory research proj› ect  to  develop  new  fibers  and  fabrics  for  a  lightweight overgarment that would have  reduced heat stress, longer shelf life,  and longer wear life.

While it planned and funded  the development of still other new  items  of defensive  equipment,  the  Army judged its  most serious chemical warfare deficiency to be in its ability to retaliate. The current stockpile  of toxic  chemical  munitions,  which  was deteriorating through age and obsolesence, had to be modern› ized  before  it  could  be an  effective  deterrent to Soviet  use  of chemical  weaponry.  The Army  believed  that  binary  munitions for 155-mm. weapons were the best answer to the modernization requirement. These munitions form a lethal chemical agent from two nonlethal agents when they are combined, which occurs only after the artillery shell  containing  them  has  been fired.  In ad› dition  to  the  safety  afforded  by  binary  munitions during pro› duction, storage, and movement, they would be, in  the Army's judgement, the best weapon and agent mix for achieving a cred-

ible retaliatory capability. By the end of the fiscal year, the Con› gress  had  appropriated  funds  for  construction  and  plant processing equipment for a  binary munitions production facility at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas.  Construction was scheduled to start in October 1981.

Provisions of the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1981 required the Army to remove all chemical munitions from Rocky  Mountain  Arsenal, Colorado,  by  10  October  1981. The Army safely transferred these munitions to Tooele Army Depot, Utah, through a  combination of  air and ground movements be› tween 12 and 28 August. A total of  888 Weteye bombs containing GB agent and three one-ton containers of bulk GB agent were relocated during the operation.

Among defoliants  used  in  Vietnam  during  the  war  to  kill vegetation  and thus deprive  enemy  forces  of concealment,  the main  one  was  a  herbicide  known  as  Agent  Orange.  In  recent years, aJlegations that exposure to Agent Orange has resulted in a  variety of maladies-cancer among them-have generated in› tense concern among veterans  of the  war.  To date,  these  alle› gations  have  not  been  substantiated,  but,  as  mandated  by Congress,  the  Veterans Administration  this  year began an epi› demiological study of the possible health effects of  the herbicide. The study is designed to determine not only whether the agent can produce an adverse effect on human health but also whether a  given veteran was actually exposed to the herbicide and, if so, to what degree. The Army will support the study by providing detailed  records  of herbicide  spraying,  troop  movements,  and unit membership during the war.

The Army periodically conducts formal system program re› views  (SPR)  as  a  means  of bringing  to  the  attention  of senior management  critical  issues  requiring  special  consideration.  A chemical  SPR  was  conducted last year under the chairmanship of the Vice  Chief of Staff;  in  December of this  year,  a  general officer in-process review, also chaired by the Vice Chief  of  Staff, was  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  recommendations  resulting from  the  SPR  were being translated  into adequate action.  For management purposes, the in-process review included the tactical nuclear program with the chemical program. Major chemical is› sues  were  addressed  including  training and  doctrinal  develop› ments,  munitions  demilitarization,  medical  aspects,  and equipment. Tasks were assigned to appropriate commands and agencies on those matters that needed new or improved action.

At last year's chemical SPR, the Vice Chief of Staff directed the preparation of an Army chemical action plan that would be

a comprehensive, time-phased blueprint for chemical warfare and for nuclear, biological, and chemical defense efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. The plan that was developed provided directions for near-term actions having a limited impact on resources that  would rapidly improve readiness, such as  training, and  supplied guid› ance for  mid- and  long-range  requirements  that would  have  a significant impact on  budgets,  as in the  case  of stockpile  mod› ernization. The Chief of Staff approved the plan in June of this year.

Consideration  of the  tactical  nuclear  program  at  the  com› bined nuclear and chemical in-process review conducted in  De› cember resulted in new directives for TRADOC and DARCOM. The Training and Doctrine Command was directed to accelerate its development of  integrated battlefield models and scenarios to reflect current doctrine.  DARCOM  was  assigned  to  review its nuclear  survivability  programs  to  ensure  that  automated  data processing  equipment and  data  storage  devices  could  survive. Progress  in  accomplishing these  tasks  will  be  measured at the next in-process review,  tentatively scheduled for October  1981.

In  1977 and  1978,  public controversy over the  Army's de› velopment of new  nuclear weapons with  "enhanced radiation" characteristics extended around  the world and was  particularly intense in Europe. Their development grew out of the Army's search for a nuclear means of  stopping a massed tank or armored vehicle  attack  without  unnecessary  collateral  damage  and  cas› ualties to nonmilitary structures and personnel. Opponents of  the new  weapons believed that their reduced collateral damage fea› ture increased the likelihood of their being used in  battle,  thus increasing the probability of nuclear warfare. In response to the opposition,  President  Carter  deferred  their  production.  This year, President Reagan announced that enhanced radiation war› heads would be produced and assembled. They will be stockpiled only in  U.S.  territory, and any  decision  to  deploy  them  will  be made only after full consultation with the countries in which they would be based.

The Long Range Security Program (LRSP) is  the European portion of  the Army's  worldwide Nuclear and Chemical Weapons Storage Site  Upgrade  Program.  The upgrading of 102  Army storage sites in Europe under LRSP criteria involves the replace› ment, construction, or installation of  security control centers fully protected against small  arms fire  as  well  as  perimeter fencing, additional guard towers,  igloo doors, security lighting,  intrasite communications,  and  an  intrusion  detection  system.  The  re› quired  upgrading  is  being achieved  through  a  combination  of

U.S.  prefinancing and  NATO funding. The improvements pre› financed by the United States are well on the way to completion; but those to be funded by NATO are scarcely beyond the plan› ning stage  because national  concerns of various members  have repeatedly clogged the funding approval process of NATO.

In April, a  Nuclear Weapons Accident Exercise (NUWAX81) was conducted jointly by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) at the DOE's Nevada test site,  in  which  the  Army  was  the  primary  military  player.  The major objectives were to exercise and evaluate the Federal Emer› gency Management Agency's interface with DOD, the command and  control  of the joint  DOD-DOE response  forces,  and  the coordination of their technical and logistical support. These ob› jectives  were  achieved,  and  the  exercise  also  aroused  greater awareness within federal  and state  governments of the need to plan and coordinate response  procedures and to practice these procedures.

## Military Support to Civil Authorities

The presidential campaign of 1980 and inauguration of 1981 created extensive requirements for Army support in  communi› cations  and  protection.  For  communications  support,  Signal Corps personnel  were placed in a  staging area at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and, from  there, were dispatched in small  teams to in› stall  and  maintain  radio  equipment,  to order commercial  tele› phone service, and to provide communications support required by U.S. Secret Service protective details. Explosive ordnance dis› posal personnel also assisted the U.S. Secret Service in over 1,250 bomb searches throughout the United States and in several for› eign countries. Following the election of President Reagan, the Army assisted  both the outgoing and incoming administrations to ensure a  smooth  transition  of the  government's leadership. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army was the Army's Coordinator for Transition. Army actions included the  preparation  of orientation  materials  for  the  Reagan  DOD transition team, special debriefings and information for outgoing Army secretariat officials, and orientation materials and briefings for nominees to Army secretariat positions.

The Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic Program, better known as MAST, began its second decade of service shortly be› fore the start of this fiscal  year. During the year Louisville, Ken› tucky,  became a  MAST operating site when the 316th Medical Detachment  (Helicopter  Ambulance)  began  providing  emer-

gency medical helicopter transport services in the Louisville area. With  this  addition,  there  was  a  total  of twenty-nine  operating MAST sites supported by thirty-one units representing both the active and reserve components of the Army and Air Force. Dur› ing the  year,  these  units flew  3,326  missions,  evacuated  3,284 patients, and logged 7,638 hours. Since MAST operations began in  1970,  Army aeromedical  units and  Air Force rescue and re› covery  units  have  flown  more  than  54,000  hours  to  complete some  24,000  missions.  These  missions  included  transporting a total  of 25,000 patients plus  medical personnel, blood, and hu› man organs for transplant.

When civilian air traffic controllers of the Federal  Aviation Administration went on strike and were later dismissed from their jobs by President Reagan, the military services were called upon to fill the void until the air traffic control system could be rebuilt. A total  of 1,248 controllers from all  services were provided for duty  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration,  of which  315 were from  the U.S.  Army Communications Command. It is  ex› pected that their support will  be needed through June 1983.

There  was  little  demand  this  year  for  military  support  in either domestic or foreign disaster relief.  Of eighteen domestic disasters  and  emergencies  declared by  the  President,  only  two required support, and this amounted to only minor logistical and troop  support.  In  Italy,  the  strongest  earthquake  in  sixty-five years occurred southeast of  Rome on 23 November 1980, killing over 3,000 people, injuring over 5,000, and leaving more than 250,000 homeless. In response to requests from the Italian gov› ernment,  the  Army  provided  130  men,  4  UH-1  helicopters, 1,000 tents, and other equipment to assist  in relief operations.

## 3. Force Development, Doctrine, and Training

Army efforts to mold men,  units, and materiel into combat forces capable of meeting U.S.  defense  needs  received  a  boost during fiscal year 1981 as a new administration moved to increase military spending to levels commensurate with arming and main› taining a  military establishment second to none. The additional support sharpened debate, both within  the Army and without, regarding  the  size  and  content  of Army  combat  and  support forces, the Army's  ability to  assimilate advanced weapons systems, the adequacy of training,  the role of reserve components, and the adequacy of mobilization  planning and  procedures.  These were but a few of the factors that figured in the force develop› ment process during the past year.

## Force Development

The Army made no major changes in the existing 24-division (16  active and 8  reserve component) structure, but did  make a number of adjustments within the structure, some of which are noted in  Chapters 2  and  8.  It considered organizing two addi› tional divisions in the reserve components and adding an active brigade to  the  24th  Infantry Division,  one of two active Army divisions  having a  National  Guard roundout brigade as part of its  organization.  But the  Army expanded neither its active  nor its reserve forces and gave first priority to improving the readiness and modernization of the 24-division structure.

The Total Army Analysis (TAA) conducted during 1981  es› tablished the initial force structure used in developing the Army Program Objective Memorandum (POM) for fiscal years 19841988, including nondivisional and tactical support requirements and essential support force requirements. For the first time TDA (tables of distribution and allowances)  units were  included, and units required to support mobilization were identified. The Force Development Directorate,  Office  of the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (ODCSOPS), worked on revising Army Regulation 71-11, improving the TAA process, and placing the analysis on a  biennial cycle.

Improvements  in  the  T AA  were  part  of a  larger  effort  to strengthen the link between planning and programming aspects of the Army Planning, Programming, Executing, and Budgeting

System  (PPEBS).  In the past, planners have emphasized the de› velopment  of combat forces  to accomplish  approved strategic requirements  based on worldwide threats and have given little consideration to support forces,  materiel, and training base  re› quirements to sustain the combat elements. Programmers, on the other hand,  had  to deal  with  such  down-to-earth factors  as  re› source  limits  and  budgetary  constraints.  As  a  result,  planning guidance had little influence on program development.

Recent changes to the PPEBS have improved the link between planning and programming.  Now  planners develop and recom› mend macro force  alternatives  which  describe  operational and support forces  in  terms of structure,  readiness,  modernization, and sustainability. They weigh each alternative against projected resources to determine feasibility and recommend priorities for the allocation  of available resources.

In  developing  macro  force  alternatives,  guidance  from  the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the senior Army leadership is considered in  conjunction with an assessment of  current force capabilities and resource constraints. Force alternatives, including operational and support forces, are developed. These forces are described by building blocks:

Each building block is examined in terms of NATO missions (both forces deployed and CONUS based), Northeast Asia (for-

<!-- image -->

ward deployed and CONUS based), and rapid deployment. Re› sources associated  with  each of the building blocks are fixed in terms of  fiscal obligation, authority, and manpower. These blocks and associated resources are categorized in terms of force struc› ture, readiness,  modernization, and sustainability.

In force structuring, the numbers of  active and reserve com› ponent  division  increments,  nondivisional  combat  increments, tactical  support increments,  cadre divisions,  and  roundout bri› gades are considered. In building readiness, authorized levels of organization in terms of manning and equipping the operational and support forces, equipment levels associated with POMCUS, and manning and fiscal  enhancements to the training and doc› trine base are examined. For modernization, the procurement of more up-to-date equipment and the associated manpower needed to implement Army 86 structures are studied. The need for high technology development and testing for light and heavy divisions is addressed, and sustaining levels of war reserve stocks and the ratio of tactical support increments to division  increments (tail› to-tooth ratios) are considered.

Alternatives  are constructed  in  which  the  quantitative  and qualitative  aspects  of structure,  readiness,  modernization,  and sustainability are  varied.  To determine  feasibility,  mission  pos› tures are set,  and  the  costs  of these  alternatives are  compared with  current and projected levels  of fiscal  obligation authority and manpower ceilings.  The selection  of the alternative  which will  be  the  basis  for  the  Army  Plan  is  a  detailed  process  that includes briefings 4 nd discussions with the principals in both the Army secretariat and the staff. The Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff make the final  decisions.

The Army Plan is the implementation memorandum for the Secretary of the Army's and Chief of Staff's planning guidance to programmers.  It considers the decisions  made on the major issues associated with  the allocation  of constrained resources to the  macro  force  alternatives.  Both  operational  forces  and  the support base are addressed.  Facilities are also  given prominent attention. Planning guidance is provided in four categories: read› iness, sustainability, modernization, and force structure. T he ini› tial plan  is scheduled for publication in December 1981 and will be the basis for the development of  the Army Program Objective Memorandum and the Extended Planning Annex FY  84-98.

Phase  II  of the  study  for  Improving  the  Definition  of the Army  Objective  Force Methodology  (IDOFOR),  an  important part of the Army's effort to develop a  more effective force de› velopment  process-described  in  the  previous  summary-was

carried  out during the  past year.  IDOFOR II focused  on  pro› viding a  methodology  for a  non-NATO scenario,  as  well as for NATO, and the development of  a risk assessment and acquisition strategy capability. This latter effort produced a methodology to examine production capability, personnel availability,  and fund› ing estimates and to recommend annual acquisition and retention objectives for critical equipment systems. Phase II also expanded development of the capability to design alternative forces within projected manpower and fiscal  constraints for the period under review. This capability included the examination of  other possible designs for  force  additions as  well  as  the evaluation  of various alternative forces.  IDOFOR II  methodology  will  be integrated into  other  Army  force  development  studies,  such  as  the Joint Strategic  Planning  Document  QSPD)  Analysis  and  the  macro analysis of force alternatives. This effort,  termed IDOFOR III, will  be conducted in  fiscal  year  1982.

The Army uses or has under development several automated management information systems to aid the force development process. There were a number of noteworthy happenings during the year concerning these systems.

The  use  of The  Army  Authorization  Documents  System (TAADS) continued to increase. Two new posts, Fort Drum, New York, and the Army Research Armament and Develo'pment  Com› mand,  Dover,  New Jersey,  received  the  installation  subsystem (ITAADS).  This addition  brought the  number of installations covered  to fifty-seven.  Vertical  TAADS,  the subsystem  used at major  commands,  is  operational  at seventeen  locations.  Head› quarters,  Department of the  Army,  processed  20,484 TAADS documents during the year.

Even  as  the  use  of TAADS  expanded,  the  Army  continued work on the Force Development Integrated Management System (FORDIMS),  which  will  replace TAADS,  the  Army Force Pro› gram (AFP),  and  the  Civilian  Budget System  (CBS).  The  Au› thorization  Subsystem  (replacement  for  T AADS)  is  currently operational. Testing of the Program and  Budgeting Subsystem (replacement  for  AFP  and  CBS)  started  in  March  1981.  Com› pleted tests on  the Force Structure Subsystem (FSS),  which  was designed  to support discrete guidance  tracking,  showed  that a more  flexible,  less  demanding  form  of guidance  tracking  was necessary.  A general  officer in-process review  (IPR); conducted in  December 1980, decided to discontinue work on the FSS and discrete guidance tracking and called for development of  detailed specifications for a transition method of  guidance tracking. Spec› ifications for the transition system  were completed in  February

1981 , and the U.S. Army Management Systems Support Agency (USAMSSA) began development.  Work  was  temporarily halted in June 1981 so that all FORD  IMS programming resources could be  used  to  complete  other  testing.  Development  of guidance tracking is  scheduled to resume early in  fiscal  year  1982.

Work on  the Vertical  Force  Development Management In› formation System (VFDMIS) continued to accelerate during the past year.  The Army won approval of equipment procurement for the system in  the amount of $7.8 million covering fiscal years 1984-1986. A system  product manager was  designated  in July 1981,  and staffing of the  product manager's office  was  begun. Automated Sciences Group, Inc., received a contract for design and program work and General Research Corporation obtained a contract to assist the product manager with functional require› ments. Following a system review late in the fiscal year, the prod› uct manager sought the assistance of  the Intelligence and Security Command in  determining  how  to  provide  users  who  had  un› classified  remote terminals  with access  to a  classified  data base; he  also  enlisted  the  aid  of the  Communications  Command  in calculating equipment requirements.

Development  of the  Force  Management  Decision  System (FMDS) began  in  August  1981.  In  September,  functional  re› quirements  were  developed  and  forwarded  to  USAMSSA  for evaluation. FMDS wilJ assist force managers and force integration system  officers on the Army staff in conducting impact analysis for  changes in force structure and asset conditions.

An improvement to the Logistics Structure and Composition System (LOGSACS), to provide management data dealing with pre-positioning of materiel configured to  unit sets (POMCUS), was  completed during the  reporting period.  It provides  requi› sitioning authority  to  Combat Equipment Group,  Europe,  and enables the Army staff  and the Depot Systems Command to man› age POMCUS at varying levels of detail  from  individual sets  to complete division  sets.  Furthermore,  the  POMCUS addition  to LOGSACS reflects equipment changes caused by force modern› ization  actions  indicated  in  the  Program  Objective  Memoran› dum.

In  a  related  action,  General  Research  Corporation  worked on a  contract it  received  in  September  1980 to improve LOG› SACS's Basis  of Issue  Plan  (BOIP).  The BOIP determines  the equipment changes by unit that are required to support the field› ing of new  weapons systems,  or the introduction of equipment items to augment or upgrade the Army's  mission capabilities. The improvement,  which  is  scheduled  for completion early  in  fiscal

year  1982,  will  give  to  materiel  procurement and  distribution planners  the  requirements  on  a  time-phased  basis  for  fielding each new or improved item.

An  improved BOIP  will  ease  the  strain  of distributing  in› creased quantities of weapons that come into the Army's inven› tory as  a  result  of long-term  modernization  efforts.  One such weapon,  the Stinger man-portable air defense system, achieved initial operational capability in  February 1981  with the 11th Ar› mored Cavalry  in  Germany.  The Stinger was  the first  new air defense system  the Army had fielded since the mid-l 960s.  Pro› duction and deployment of Stinger to Europe was on schedule. Another  system,  the  Improved  TOW  Vehicle  (ITV),  is  an Ml l 3Al Armored Personnel Carrier that has been modified to carry an armored TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire› guided) missile launcher mounted on a powered cupola. The ITV provides armor and armored cavalry units with a long-range an› titank capability. It would be routinely employed from concealed defilade positions that expose only the sights and launchers. Tar› gets  would be engaged  from  2,000  to  3,000  meters  to  exploit TOW's range advantage. Distribution of !TVs to Europe began in February 1980 and will be completed in February 1982. Field› ing in the continental  United States wiIJ continue  through  Oc› tober 1982.

The Army signed a contract with Litton Data Systems on 16 October 1980 for  the purchase of forty-three Tactical  Fire  Di› rection Systems (TACFIRE), successfully concluding an intensive effort to restart the program that Congress had stopped during deliberations on the fiscal  year 1980 budget.  A contract for the final  twenty-three sets  required  to  outfit all  active  Army  units was signed on 29 July 1981. During the year the Army received twenty-three sets ordered under previous contracts;  final  deliv› eries were in April  1981.  Because of the break in the program, deliveries will  not be resumed until the summer of 1982. Mean› while,  the 1st Infantry Division  (Mechanized), FORSCOM, and the 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized), USAREUR, became op› erational TACFIRE units-the 1st in May  1981, and the 8th the following August. TACFIRE equipment was shipped to the 41st Field Artillery Brigade in  September  1981.

The Army's plan to obtain 7,340 M60A3 tanks with thermal tank sights-I,  741  from new production and 5,599 through con› version of  older M60 series tanks-moved forward. By the close of the reporting period,  1,741  new  M60A3s and  1,164 conver› sions  had  been  funded.  The  number  of new  tanks  produced reached 1,561; of  these,  1,260 have been shipped to USAREUR,

which had first  priority in  distributing M60A3  with  subs~quent issue  to  FORSCOM  units.  Conversion  of M60Al  tanks  to  an M60A3 configuration began in July l 98 l  at the Anniston Army Depot, and a similar program will  get under way  involving 458 vehicles at the Mainz Army Depot early in  fiscal  year  1982. An ODCSOPS proposal to convert M60A2 tanks to M60A3s did not mesh with production line scheduling and was discarded. Earlier plans  to  convert  the  105-mm.-gun-equipped  M60A2s  with  an M48A5 turret (the converted vehicle was designated the M48A7) were held in abeyance as DARCOM evaluated a new ODCSOPS proposal to make them over to armored vehicle launched bridges (AVLBs) and combat engineer vehicles (CEVs).

The  sophistication  and  complexity  of  technologically  ad› vanced systems entering the Army's weapons arsenal has caused concern within the Army and the Office of the Secretary of De› fense  regarding how much combat support structure would be required  to  sustain U.S.  forces  in  the  early  days  of a  NATO› Warsaw Pact conflict. The result of this concern was the Combat to Support Balance Study (CSBS), a sixteen-volume report pub› lished in September 1980 which showed the effects that various assumptions regarding workload,  productivity, and the amount of host nation support would have on the size of  combat service support forces. The study has served as an effective management tool for decision makers in determining appropriate levels, mixes, and phases of support for programmed Army combat forces  in Europe.  Following  Chief of Staff approval,  ODSCOPS, ODCSLOG, Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), and the Combat Analysis Agency (CAA) began carrying out the forty› nine  specific  actions  contained  in  the  study's implementation plan.  The Force Management Directorate, ODCSOPS, is  mon› itoring  and coordinating the effort, which is proceeding on sched› ule.

Host  nation  support  (HNS),  an  important  element  in  the CSBS, is essential in satisfying shortfalls in the Army's ability to meet combat support and combat service support requirements of forward  deployed  and  deploying  U.S.  forces.  Over  the  past year the Army has continued HNS initiatives in the areas of  policy guidance, doctrine formulation, and combat support and combat service  support  negotiations.  Army  HNS  policies,  procedures, and responsibilities were laid out for the first time in Army Reg› ulation 570-9, published in January 1981.  One month later, an interagency HNS Working Group was formed under the auspices and general guidance of the HNS Advisory Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  The group's broad objective  is  to

develop  Rapid  Deployment  Force (RDF) support requirements and obtain host nation support for RDF contingencies. The first priority will  be to acquire host nation support for the near-term RDF;  the  second  priority  is  to  acquire  this  support  for  future expansion  of the  RDF  and  to  develop  a  strategy  for  entering HNS negotiations with  certain Southwest Asia countries.

Negotiations for expanded host nation support for forward deployed  and  reinforcing  forces  continued.  The  signing  of a memorandum  of understanding  (MOU)  with  Germany  is  ex› pected soon, and work on detailed agreements covering military support, civil support, and reinforcement exercises is to begin in January 1982. A considerable portion of  the support will be pro› vided by German military units. The United Kingdom, Belgium, the  Netherlands,  and  Luxembourg  reviewed  U.S.  host  nation support  requirements  presented  to  them  in  September  1980. HNS statements of principle  have  been  signed  with  all  of the countries except the Netherlands. They have agreed to provide the requested support.  Detailed requirements  will  be set down i n  lines  of  communications (LOC) agreements. Efforts to obtain LOC agreements with nations of the NATO northern and south› ern regions continued.  Umbrella, general, and technical  agree› ments have been signed with  Denmark, Norway, and Italy.

Since  1976, TRADOC has been involved in designing an ob› jective  heavy  division  for  the  mid-l 980s and  beyond.  More re› cently, complementary efforts have been initiated to redesign the light division, the corps, echelons above corps, and contingency corps. Collectively,,these several design initiatives are referred to as  Army  86.  The process  by  which  these  initiatives  and  other near-term  redesigns  of various  Army  elements,  including  the Rapid Deployment Force, are incorporated into the force struc› ture constitutes the Army 90 Transition Plan.

In  May  1981,  Army  90 transition  planning objectives  were prepared to integrate approved organizational conversions into the  force  structure requirements  process;  to develop organiza› tional conversions down  to  unit identification  code (UIC)  level of  detail for active and reserve components; and to develop UIC conversions  which  accommodate  all  relevant  factors,  including systems  modernization,  doctrine,  training,  manpower,  logistic support, facilities  and construction,  tactical  support,  stationing, and operational  readiness.  The objectives also  envisaged publi› cation of an annual transition plan to document organizational conversions over the program years,  to institutionalize the plan› ning process and management structure for guiding and directing the transition  process,  and  to  provide  necessary  resource  man-

agement information on approved organizational conversions to major commands as soon  as  possible.  ODCSOPS serves as  the lead  Army staff proponent for  Army 90 Transition  Plan devel› opment; the Transition Planning Implementation Group (TPIG), Requirements  Directorate,  has  overall  responsibility. In  July 1981, major commands were provided with guidance needed to develop a detailed Army 90 Transition  Plan  to be forwarded to the Army staff by  15 January  1982. One of the key features of the plan was that similar heavy division active units were to con› vert to the new designs during six-month periods starting in the last part of fiscal  year  1983; conversions of reserve components other than roundout units would start one year later.

The  9th  Infantry  Division's  High  Technology  Test  Bed (HTTB) program, reported on last year, is an important element in fielding a strategically deployable, lean, hard-hitting, and sus› tainable high technology light division by  1985. During the past year,  operational and organizational  (O&amp;O)  tests began  for the brigade engineer company, the antiarmor company, and the mor› tar platoon. Allied involvement in the HTTB program increased during 1981  with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada assigning special project officers to the HTTB. Other countries have  given  briefings on concepts and equipment that are possible  candidates for  O&amp;O  testing.  At the  request of the Army Chief  of  Staff, a Defense Science Board Task Force, headed by  Dr.  Eugene  Fubini,  began  a  study  to  determine  how  tech› nology could be integrated into the High Technology Light Di› vision.

As noted in last year's  report, ODCSOPS is sponsoring a com› prehensive Casualty Estimation Study (CES) to develop a reliable methodology  for  estimating  wartime  casualties.  The  Concepts Analysis  Agency  (CAA)  is  responsible  for  Part  I  of the  study, which  pertains to short-term  improvements in  theater-level cas› ualty estimates under conventional warfare conditions. Part II of the study is  being done by the Army Models Improvement Pro› gram (AMIP) Office of  the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leav› enworth.  The AMIP office  will  develop  detailed  methodology for Army wartime casualty estimation in two categories: (1) con› ventional  plus chemical and  (2)  conventional, chemical and  nu› clear. The CAA should complete Part I of  the study in December 1981. The remainder of the study will  then be accomplished by the AMIP, with developmental work continuing through calendar year 1982.

The Aviation  Requirements for  the  Combat Structuring of the Army (ARCSA) Ill study, which was conducted by the U.S.

Army Aviation Center, Fort Rucker, beginning in February 1977, developed  the current aviation  force  structure.  Based on  study results, the Army Chief  of  Staff  approved an aviation force struc› ture consisting of 48 attack helicopter companies, 38 air cavalry troops, 46 combat support aviation companies, and 32 medium helicopter companies.  Implementation of ARCSA III continued during the year with the inactivation of an aviation battalion and four separate companies,  two of which were divisional support companies.  In  turn,  two  combat  aviation  battalions  were  acti› vated,  one at  Fort  Hood  and  the  other at  Fort  Riley,  while  a combat aviation  company  was activated  to support the  brigade at Fort Benning. A follow-up study, ARCSA IV, which is sched› uled  to begin in  April  1982, will be the basis for future aviation structure and planning. It will consider all  Army 90 designs that have a  major impact on the aviation  force structure.

## Concepts and Doctrine

Force designs coming from the Army 86 studies reflect ideas embodied  in  the  Airland  Battle,  an  evolving  concept  that  de› scribes current thinking on what is  needed to win  on the battle› field of  the 1980s, especially in Western Europe. It envisages the integration  of conventional,  nuclear,  chemical,  and  electronic means and the extension of the battlefield to bring the full  po› tential of  U.S. air and land forces to bear on the enemy's  second echelon forces as well as on his assault forces.  The concept of  an extended battlefield with emphasis on maneuvering,  disrupting enemy follow-up forces, and seizing the initiative by attacking, as well  as  defeating enemy assault elements, goes considerably be› yond current doctrine for the use of  corps and divisions. As  the fiscal year closed, TRADOC and the Command and General Staff College were working on a major revision of Field Manual 1005, "Operations," to incorporate the Airland Battle concept.

While the Army revamped its combat doctrine around con› cepts that  incorporated  the  use  of conventional,  chemical,  and nuclear means to meet the threat posed by Warsaw Pact forces, little  progress  was  made  during  the  past  year  to  limit  or ban chemical and nuclear weapons.

Since 1977, the United States and the Soviet Union have held twelve rounds of talks to reach a joint proposal for presentation before  the  United  Nations  Committee  on  Disarmament  that would form  the  basis  for  negotiation of a  multilateral chemical arms control  treaty.  The  U.S.  objective  has  been  to  obtain  a comprehensive agreement banning the  production,  possession,

transfer, and use of chemical weapons.  Progress in the bilateral discussions has lagged because of disagreement over verification, declaration of  stocks and facilities, and when the ban would take effect. The Reagan administration put off the thirteenth round of U.S.-USSR talks pending reassessment of  arms control policy and strategy.  Delays  in  holding  bilateral  talks  and  the  lack  of progress in the discussions held to date will intensify pressure on the  Committee  on  Disarmament's  Warfare  Working  Group, which was established in 1980 to define chemical weapons control issues,  to begin negotiation of a  treaty.

Work on the Strategic  Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT)  lay dormant during 1981; the only work being accomplished was the development of a  study entitled "Basic Considerations for U.S. SALT Policy."  During the year, focus shifted from SALT talks to arms control negotiations as  NATO's long-range theater nu› clear force  modernization decision of December  1979 received public and political attention, primarily from the Europeans. En› couraged by Soviet propaganda, intense pressure was brought to bear on the United States to commence the arms-control side of the two-track  1979 modernization decision.  Continuous consul› tation with the alliance, through the NATO Special Consultative Group, was affected by delays in developing the U.S. negotiating position. Secretary of  State Alexander Haig and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko met in  New York  on  23-26 September 1981 and announced that arms-control negotiations would open in Ge› neva on 30 November 1981.

Almost six years of study and work came to fruition in July 1981  with  the  publication of Field  Manual  9-6,  "Ammunition Service  in  the  Theater  of Operations."  It  describes  basic  am› munition doctrine for the Army and is  the product of the Mu› nitions Systems Support Structure (MS3) Study, which was begun in  1975  by  the  U.S.  Army  Missile  and  Munitions  Center and School. The manual establishes doctrine for ammunition transfer points (ATP) in the brigade trains of divisions and separate bri› gades, replaces the direct support and general support conven› tional  ammunition company  with  separate direct  support (DS) and  general  support (GS)  units,  combines existing  OS  and GS special ammunition companies into a  DS-GS unit, improves the man  to  machine  ratio  to  provide  for  increased  efficiency,  and incorporates the throughput of ammunition into doctrine. Dur› ing the Total Army Analysis (T  AA) for fiscal  years  1984-1988, all active and reserve component conventional ammunition units were  scheduled  for  conversion  to  the  new  MS3  tables  of or› ganization  and  equipment.  The  conversions  were  spread

throughout the  program  years.  Special  ammunition  companies are  listed  in  the  extended  planning annex,  pending  receipt of major command advice concerning program timing.

Mobilization  planning and testing  continued to  be a  major concern  within  the  Army  and  throughout  the  Department  of Defense. PROUD SPIRIT, a command post exercise sponsored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff OCS),  began on 6  November 1980 and lasted until 18 November. The Army's participation, referred to as MOBEX 80 and to relate it to the previous biennial exercises› MOBEX  76  and  MoBEX  78-continued  until  26  November. MOBEX  80  tested  the  Army's critical  mobilization and  deploy› ment  procedures and  provided  the  first  opportunity  to  apply recommendations contained in the Army Command and Control Study-82,  which  stemmed from  concerns of the  Army and of the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense that the reserve component command structure was excessively layered and redundant. Par› ticular attention was given to procedures and systems which had been deficient in  previous exercises: the new Army Mobilization and  Planning System  (AMOPS),  Army  command and control, Army  participation  in the  Joint  Operation  Planning  System OOPS) and the Joint Deployment System ODS),  and the Army wartime asset redistribution planning and management systems.

MoBEX  80 was  most successful in providing valuable  mobili› zation and deployment experience to many command and staff personnel throughout the Army. The training function, verifying capabilities, and identifying training deficiencies are primary ob› jectives of the MOBEX  series.  And while no new  major problems surfaced,  results  clearly  showed  that problems and deficiencies uncovered during MoBEX 76 and 78 had not been resolved, par› ticularly in  the areas of  command and control, ammunition and equipment shortfalls,  filler  requirements,  and  the ability  of in› dustry  to  resupply  basic  items  required  to  sustain  the  combat forces.

The Army formed the Mobilization Review Committee and the General Officer Mobilization  Review  Group to ensure that action would be taken  to  remedy shortcomings  that  hampered the Army's  ability to meet mobilization and deployment require› ments. The first committee reviews and monitors remedial action projects (RAPs), makes decisions regarding the sufficiency of  pro› posed  corrections, and recommends actions to the General Of› ficer  Mobilization  Review  Group  on  major  issues.  The  other group acts on  the recommendations and directs measures to be taken on these issues.  Both bodies include representatives from the Army staff and major commands. An Army staff proponent

for each RAP submits quarterly updates to the review committee on the status of corrective actions.

In Exercise PROUD  SPIRIT-MOBEX  80,  the need resurfaced for a clear definition of  essential information required for man› agement of crisis  situations  and  execution  of mobilization  and deployment by Headquarters, Department of  the Army (HQDA). At the  Four Star  Mobilization  Conference held on  31  January 1981  and chaired by the Army Vice Chief of Staff, the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Operations and Plans was directed to coordinate the  review  of  information  requirements  for  the  purpose  of streamlining reporting procedures to provide only essential  in› formation  to  HQDA.  The  Operations,  Readiness,  and  Mobili› zation Directorate of ODCSOPS initiated three parallel efforts. The first involved a review of data elements currently available to HQDA from  automated  data  processing  systems  accessible through the Worldwide Military Command and Control System to  extract only  essential  data  elements  in  crisis  situations.  The second was a  user survey  of selected  reports sponsored by the Office  of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff to  identify  nonessential  re› porting  requirements  and  to  streamline  the  Joint  Reporting Structure, particularly for wartime information needs. The third effort was to identify critical information requirements for crisis management regardless of  the capabilities of  currently  automated systems. The three efforts focused on efficiently using automated data  sources  and  providing  instructions  for  manual  reporting where necessary,  while  guiding the development of automation improvements.

As a  result of an analysis of information needs, use of trans› action processing, and coordination with Forces Command, a re› duction of 67 percent has been achieved in the data required by HQDA to monitor the status of force mobilization.  Similar co› ordination with the Joint Deployment Agency has resulted in a 74-percent reduction of data needed by HQDA to monitor the status of force deployment.

Army  staff analysis  of data  coming  through  the Joint  Re› porting Structure  has  focused  on  the  Unit Status and  Identity Report (UNITREP) as having the greatest potential for reduction of reporting requirements. For example, more than half of the data currently required from Army units to compile the report is  not considered essential  by  the Army staff for  wartime  man› agement.  Further  refinement  and  subsequent  modification  of joint  reporting  instructions  will  be  undertaken  in  the  coming fiscal  year.

Critical information requirements by the Army staff for crisis

management  were  coordinated  for  publication  in  Volumes  III and IV of the Army Mobilization and Operations Planning Sys› tem (AMOPS). These documents will establish the requirement, unconstrained by limitations in current automated reporting sys› tems,  as  a  baseline  for  future  improvements.  Additionally,  the U.S. Army Command and Control Support Agency is developing an integrated data base and necessary programs to support the HQDA Crisis Management Team within  the current capability of automated systems.

AMOPS, described in some detail in last year's summary, is an integrated, short-range, capability planning system which sup› ports Army participation in joint operations and deployment. It replaces  the  Army  Capabilities  Plan  and HQDA Mobilization Standard Operating Procedures.  Principal  planning documents produced by  the system are the HQDA Mobilization  Plan and the major command mobilization plans,  which  collectively form the  Army  Mobilization  Plan.  Volume  I  of AMOPS, "Systems Description, Responsibilities, and Procedures,"  and Volume Ill, "Mobilization and Deployment Planning Guidance,"  were pub› lished during fiscal year 1981. Volume II, "Strategic Employment of Army Forces," and Volume IV,  "HQDA Crisis Action SOP," should be out in the coming year. With the publication of  Volume III,  AR  135-300,  "Mobilization  of Reserve  Component  Units and Individuals," became redundant and was  rescinded.

On 8 May  1981 the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  established the Joint Planning and Execution Steering Committee to allow the JCS to oversee the joint planning, mobilization, execution, and deploy› ment process.  The committee, chaired by the Director of Op› er  a ti  on  s, 0 JCS,  consists  of  general  and  flag  officer representatives from the joinl staff and the services. The Army also  provided a full-time  action officer as a  member of the joint working group  which assisted  the  committee  in  assessing  defi› ciencies,  formulating  objectives,  and  putting  together  recom› mendations for corrective action.

The committee identified a number of  major deficiencies: the current  contingency planning process was regionally oriented and not based on real capabilities; it did not support deliberate plan› ning and crisis response  requirements and contained no option› developing  capability  for  the JCS and  the  National  Command Authority; deployment planning did not provide for meaningful collection  of information  at  appropriate  command  levels;  and deployment execution was  not flexible.

Action  through the end of the fiscal  year focused  on devel› oping a  model  for  a  new joint process  which  would be both  a

planning and an execution tool. It would support the application and direction of military force with the responsiveness and flex› ibility required  by  the  National  Command  Authority;  allow changes of  direction and graduated application of  force; give the capability to determine combat support and combat service sup› port forces, materiel and transportation requirements, and short› falls;  and provide for the assessment of the total force's  ability to meet national military strategy in the near term.

The Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in collaboration with the military departments, developed plans for allocating among the services the 100,000 ready reservists that the President could order to active duty without declaring a  national emergency, as provided for by Public Law 96-584, which the President signed on 23  December 1980. Before the new law went into effect the number of reservists who could be called was limited to 50,000. The Army allocated its portion to the major commands to meet premobilization  requirements  for  minor  contingencies  or as  a prelude to a  declaration of mobilization.

The importance of industrial support and the condition of the training base received a great deal of  attention during MOBEX 80 and throughout the remainder of fiscal  year 1981.

In November 1980, ODCSRDA hosted chief executives from various industries to hear their views on what actions the Army should take to enhance the responsiveness of the industrial base and the effectiveness of planning with industry.

The conferees noted that significant improvement in indus› trial  preparedness depended upon a  clear national policy citing the  need  for  an  industrial  base  responsive  to  national  security interests  and  that  war  reserve  stocks  should  be  increased  to  a level  compatible with the ability of the base  to  meet sustaining requirements.  Associated with  war reserve stocks was  the need to  identify  production  constraints and  to  pace  items,  with  the view of stockpiling those components or items which have long lead-times.

There was general agreement that both the private and Army› owned industrial base should be modernized to ensure adequate industrial production in an emergency situation. State-of-the-art manufacturing technology, greater attention to product quality, and increased capital buildup through such actions as tax incen› tives,  improved contract and profit policies,  and direct  govern› ment investment would be necessary to modernize the industrial base. Failure to modernize and improve productivity would result in  cor:itinued  deterioration of manufacturing capability and re› sponsiveness.

The conferees also  observed that increased use  of standard commercial components, particularly in technologies which were advancing more quickly  than others,  would increase emergency availability of military hardware and should also reduce the cost.

A second conference was  held in  May  1981  to continue the dialogue with  key  industry  leaders,  to  inform  members  of the new  administration concerning industrial  base  issues  and prob› lems,  and  to  present a  DOD  Action  Plan for  Improvement of Industrial  Preparedness.  The  DOD  plan  evolved  from  the MOBEX-80 industrial program and other recent  studies, including the House Armed Services Committee report issued in December 1980 entitled "The Ailing Defense Industrial Base, Unready for Crisis." The plan was structured around three key elements: (1) national  resource  base-overcoming near-term  materiel  short› ages and lead-time problems, improving critical raw material self› sufficiency,  obtaining enough skilled labor, and  improving pro› ductivity; (2) defense acquisition process-improving stability of Army procurement, creating a more attractive environment for the defense contractor, and improving equipment productivity; and (3)  industrial  preparedness-achieving more consistency in defense  programs and funding,  creating an organizational and legislative  environment  conducive  to  industrial  preparedness, planning, and mobilization, and maintaining a responsive defense industrial base. The Army participated with representatives from the other military services on a Department of Defense task force organized to coordinate implementation of  the DOD Action Plan.

ODCSRDA initiated a study within the American Defense Pre› paredness Association (AD  PA) during fiscal  year  1981  to deter› mine what must be done in order for the industrial base to double end-item production of  nine critical materiel items in six to twelve months.  A  crucial  objective was  to  identify  systemic  problems that inhibited the accelerated delivery of  end-items. In this regard the Army expects to identify affordable investment opportunities to eliminate  bottlenecks in  the production  process, and  to take advantage of those opportunities during the normal budget pro› cess or when increased periods of tension make a show of resolve necessary. The study results are due in  the first quarter of  fiscal year  1982.

The Army also  made  a  major  effort  to  budget  for  future acquisition of  individual clothing and equipment and major end› items of  equipment that were essential to support the mobilization training  base.  The shortage  of equipment available  to support mobilization  expansion is  the principal constraint upon  the po› tential  capability of the mobilization  base to accept the 133,000

new soldiers for training during the first month of mobilization as  required  under  current  plans.  To  help  alleviate  equipment shortages, the Army refurbished a  significant number of M-14 rifles during I 981. These are available as back-up support to the training base  upon mobilization.

Mobilization planning has revealed that facilities available for the training base will also be insufficient, particularly in the areas of  trainee billeting and training  ranges  support. Funding has been requested  for  the  purpose  of selecting specific  locations  at  in› stallations for  the expansion of facilities  upon mobilization, and for mobilization construction planning.

An automated planning system for management of the mo› bilization  training  base  has  been  under  development  for  two years. In the later part of  fiscal  year 1981, the first Mobilization Army  Program for  Individual  Training (MOBARPRINT)  was produced from this system. This document provides guidance to help reception stations, training centers, and service schools meet projected post-mobilization requirements for trained manpower.

During fiscal  year  1981  the Office of the Chief of Engineers took several actions which stressed the importance of planning and positioned resources to support a full  mobilization and de› ployment.

The  Office  of the  Chief of Engineers,  together  with  the CONUS major commands, identified construction needs for the first ninety days of  a full  mobilization.  Subsequent requirements for the construction program from  M-day to M plus 180 will  be defined  during  the  annual  update  of the  Program  Objective Memorandum (POM). The fiscal year 1983-1987 POM contains funding for advance planning and design, including development of  standard plans for required facilities as well as site adaptations of these plans to facilitate early construction requirements. In a related action, the Civil  Works Appropriations Committee pro› vided  funds  in  the  fiscal  year  1982-1987  time  frame  to  make better use of Corps civil works assets in support of military con› struction in case of  mobilization or  a national defense emergency.

In  other actions  the  Corps began  to streamline procedures consistent with emergency laws,  policies, and organizations; pre› pared legislative proposals in  support of the Corps mobilization mission,  which  were under review by higher headquarters; and defined  the  basic  concepts for  an automated Mobilization Sta› tioning System (MSS) that will provide mobilization planners with a  means to gather information quickly  and easily  on  key  force structures and facilities.

In  1980, the Secretary  of Defense directed development of

the Civilian-Military Contingency Hospital System (CMCHS) to supplement CONUS  military  health  services  in  the  event  of a large-scale conflict overseas.  Each surgeon general is  responsible for the operation of his service's portion of the program in  ac› cordance with policy set by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).

Hospital commanders,  representing  the Department of De› fense  as  CMCHS coordinators, solicited  local  civilian  hospitals, executed written agreements with  hospitals selected for partici› pation, and prepared local operations plans and tested them pe› riodically. The DOD goal is 50,000 beds from accredited general medical and surgical hospitals. As of 30 September 1981, agree› ments totaling about one-half of the goal had been completed.

During the past year the Army acted to improve systems and procedures for accessioning and utilizing reserve component per› sonnel and retirees upon mobilization.

The Mobilization Personnel Processing System (MOBPERS), which was described in detail in last year's  report, was developed to correct a MOBEX-76 deficiency. The concept received limited testing during  MOBEX  78,  was  adopted by  the Army in  1979, and  was  implemented  in  October  1980.  MOBPERS  was  fully tested in MoBEX 80, and the concept of pre-positioning reserve component personnel data (unit and IRR) using MOBPERS pro› cedures and  the accessioning  of reserve  component  personnel into the active Army through the Standard Installation Division Personnel System-War Time  (SIDPERS-WT) was  successfully demonstrated.  Problems  were  encountered,  primarily  discrep› ancies  in source documents and data errors, but none surfaced that would invalidate MOBPERS. Data source coordination prob› lems were  resolved,  and  progress was  made  toward  correcting errors.  In  addition,  several  modifications  were  installed  to  im› prove the mobilization process.

The  Reserve  Components  Personnel  and  Administration Center  (RCPAC)  conducted a  mobilization  exercise  in  August 1981 to evaluate improvements made to MOBPERS since MOBEX 80. The test also evaluated Western Union mailgram procedures, the accuracy of the personnel data of the Individual  Ready Re› serve  (IRR),  and  the automated  data processing capabilities  at the Emergency Relocation Site (ERS) and analyzed the adequacy of existing mobilization plans.  Evaluation of the test results will be completed early in fiscal year 1982.

The Mobilization Personnel Structure and Composition Sys› tem  (MOBPERSACS)  was  revised  and expanded  in  fiscal  year 1981  to display wartime personnel requirements as reflected by

data of The Army Authorization Documents System (TAADS) submitted  by  major commands.  MOBPERSACS also shows se› lected TDA units that are needed in time of war,  MTOE units at wartime  strength,  and  mobilization  station  arrival  data and mobilization command. The Army staff, Military Personnel Cen› ter,  and  RCPAC  use  MOBPERSACS for  mobilization exercises and for  project  training  requirements,  promotions,  and  distri› bution of the mobilization forces,  including the IRR.

For the past several years the Army has  been testing a  pilot program that preassigns soldiers leaving active duty and entering the IRR to specific mobilization stations and unit assignments in case  they are recalled  to active duty during a  mobilization.  Be› cause of  the high turnover rate within the IRR, the geographical instability of IRR members, and the frequency of  organizational and stationing changes of units  that would get the preassigned reservists, the limited benefits of  the Mobilization Preassignment Program did not outweigh the difficulties involved  in  terms of cost and management;  therefore,  the program  was  dropped in favor of predesignating IRR members under MOBPERS.

The problems encountered with the pilot Mobilization Preas› signment  Program  did  not  deter  RCPAC  from  initiating  the Overseas Preassignment Program (OPP) during the first quarter of  fiscal year 1981. The program covers IRR members who reside in  USAREUR's geographic area.  All  preassignments are  made to the 21st Replacement Battalion, which will then reassign mem› bers to  meet  requirements at the  time  of mobilization.  By  the close of  fiscal  year  1981, approximately 1,500 preassignment or› ders had been issued.  The extensive turbulence of the overseas IRR population has meant that many orders have had to be re› scinded only a short time after they had been issued. Experience has  shown  that  at  any  given  time  only  between  300  and  400 individuals  hold effective orders preassigning them to  the  21st Replacement Battalion. Presently a  manual operation, plans call for  the  eventual  automation  of the  OPP and  its  expansion  to other overseas theaters.

In the spring of 1980 the Secretary of Defense directed the military  services  to  put  into  operation  by  1  October  1980  an Individual  Mobilization  Augmentation (IMA) program  which would preassign individual reservists in peacetime to active force units and organizations where they would train for·  wartime jobs. Goals  of the  new  program  were  to improve the pretrained in› dividual manpower posture of  the services, to eliminate reporting delays and the need for orientation or post-mobilization training, to bring IMA participants into the Selected Reserve where they

would be subject to active service under the President's  authority to call up as many as 100,000 selected reservists without declaring a national emergency, and to increase the involvement of gaining organizations  through  peacetime  training  and  administration. DOD Directive  1215-6 permitted the Army to transfer mobili› zation designees from  the IRR to the Selected Reserve for par› ticipation  in the IMA program, effective  1 October 1982.  With the exception of membership in the Selected  Reserve,  the IMA program closely paralleled the Mobilization Designee (MOBDES) program, which had existed since 1948. The Army chose to build the new program around the old one.

The status of MOBDES assignments at the close of the last two fiscal  years is shown below. The net gain in participants and authorized positions registered in fiscal year 1981, combined with the  participant-gain-to-loss  ratio  of  three  to  one  maintained throughout  the  year,  indicates  the  present  vitality  and  future growth potential of the MOBDES-IMA program.

Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army (HQDA), Letter 601-82-2, which established the involuntary Retiree Preassign› ment and Recall Program and provided the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for its implementation, was published on 28 August 1981. The Army continued to review mobilization tables of  distribution and allowances to determine what positions could be filled  by retirees.  By  the end of  the fiscal  year,  185,532 such positions had been documented in  the requirements base.

An audit of the retirees available  for preassignment against mobilization requirements was completed during fiscal year 1981. The total  number of qualified (by  age and health) retirees was approximately 250,000. Of  that number, approximately 176,000 were from the Regular Army and 74,000 were from the reserve components.  Comparison of assets and requirements  by  grade, skill, and location resulted in 95,087 matches with Regular Army

retirees.  They will  receive  preassignnH::nt  orders by the end  of calendar year 1982.

HQDA Letter 601-81-2 also provided for a voluntary preas› signment  program.  The effectiveness  of  a  , oluntary  approach was indicated in  Oct0ber 1980 when retirees were asked to vol› unteer for duty with the Arrned Force~ Examining and Em.ranee Stations (AFEES)  in  the evet1t of mobililatiou. Almo.:.L  immedi› ately,  1,500 volunteered. B)  July 1981, over 2,500 renrees had volunteered and  received  preassigumem  o,ders  for  toe  ~n  ... ty› seven AFEES stations  in  the continental  Urnted States,  Hawaii, and  Puerto  Rico.  The  progra1u  has  beeu  wdl  1ece1,ed  .md 1s currently 94 percent filled.

## Traiuiug aud SchooJ~11g

Inadequate 1-e~ources coutinued Lo  hampc:i- the  Army s per› formance  of its  training  mi::,siu11  during  fiscal  year  1981.  Re› porting on  the situalion  to a  coug1 &lt;::::,~ional  LOtnmittee  m  April 1981,  Army Chief of Staff General  £. C. Meyer noted that the additional  resources  needed w fully  ::,uppon  the  traming  base amounted  to  approximately  $428  rnilliun, Y,400 military  posi› tions,  and  11,600 civilian  positions.  A  good start  was  made  in correcting the situation by halting die seven-y~ar decline in the number of personnel authorized in  the training base; but addi› tional  resources were  sLill  needed,  particularly  in  the  areas  of base operations support, mitial emry training, and officer train› ing  and  education  programs.  Lace  in  che  liscal  year  HQDA ODCSOPS Training Directorate initiated a study to determine more precisely the resources required for the Training and Doc› trine Command (TRADOC) training base.

In an effort to improve the management of  training resources, the  Chief of Staff directed  The Inspector General  to examine the  relationship  between  training  proficitncy  and  training  re› sources. Consequently, The Inspector General Agency now con› ducts  training  management  inspecnons  on  a  worldwide  basis covering both active and reserve components.  inspectors report on the adequacy and implementation of training policy and pro› grams,  the availability  and  use  of training resources,  the devel› opment and use of training procedurt!s, and the readiness of  units to perform assigned missio11s.

The expansion of basic Lraining (BT) and the common skills portion  of one-station  unit  traini11g  (OSUT)  by  ninety-seven course hours was partially implememed at Fon Knox and Fort Leonard Wood on 5 January 1981. A  TRADOC evaluation per-

46

formed in May and June indicated that the expansion of  enlisted initial  entry  training (IET)  was  producing a  more  highly  moti› vated soldier who was significantly more skilled  in  combat sur› vival. Plans  moved  forward  to  carry  out  the  IET  expansion throughout the Army early in fiscal  year 1982.

IET has been affected by Project COHORT (Cohesion, Op› erational  Readiness,  Training), a  test  to determine  the Army's ability  to support a  unit  replacement system  that would reduce turbulence, improve stability, and enhance the cohesion and read› iness of units.  COHORT is  based on the four phases of the re› placement  unit  life  cycle:  IET,  stateside  tour,  deployment and tours outside CONUS (selected units),  and termination and re› placement. The twenty companies participating in COHORT in› clude  six  mechanized,  six  light  infantry,  and  three  armor companies  and  five  artillery  batteries.  TRADOC  will  conduct IET for  ten  of the  units  in  OSUT at  Forts  Benning,  Sill,  and Knox.  IET for the remaining units will  consist of basic  training at Fort Knox and advanced  individual training (AIT) at either the 1st Infantry (Mechanized), 4th Infantry (Mechanized), or 7th Infantry Divisions. As part of  the 36-month life cycle, seven com› panies  will  deploy  to  Germany  from  the  1st and  4th  Infantry (Mechanized) Divisions for their last eighteen months, and four from the 7th Infantry Division will deploy to Korea for their last twelve  months.  The  remaining  nine  companies  will  complete their life cycles by remaining with the 1st, 4th, and 7th Divisions. All  twenty COHORT units will  be terminated upon completion of the  36-month life  cycle,  and soldiers  who enlisted  for  three years will be reassigned. Eighteen of the twenty COHORT units were formed  in  1981;  the other two  will  be organized in  fiscal year  1982.

A  cyclical  surge  in  accessions  in  the  summer  of 1981  that exceeded the capability of  TRADOC's  infantry OSUT instructor and cadre was  met by  utilizing elements of USAR training di› visions  to augment TRADOC resources.  One  USAR  company was  used at Fort  Dix,  New Jersey,  and  two  USAR  companies were put into service at Fort  Jackson, South Carolina. This meas› ure was  so successful  in  meeting the surge  load  that there  was no  need  to  burden  FORSCOM,  which  was  already strained  by its support  of  reserve  component  summer  unit  training  and ROTC summer camps. It also provided USAR training division units with an opportunity to perform their mobilization missions. Plans were well under way as the fiscal year ended to expand the scope of USAR training division augmentation  to fifteen  com› panies in  the summer of 1982.

Implementation of recommendations of the Review of Edu› cation and Training for  Officers (RETO) continued during the year. The first Combined Arms and Services Staff  School (CAS3) class  of 117  students graduated  on  6 June  1981.  The school's mission is  to train officers of the active and reserve components to function as staff officers with the army in the field.  Phase I of the CAS3 course is a 142-hour nonresident program that focuses primarily on staff functions.  It will  be presented in  residence at Fort Leavenworth through fiscal year 1982 for validation before being offered on a  nonresident basis  to officers  who attend the school  in  fiscal  year  1983  and  later.  Phase  I  culminates with a qualification examination, which the officer must pass before pro› ceeding to the resident phase. Phase II is the resident TDY pro› gram which requires officers to apply their skills and knowledge in a staff environment. The resident phase lasts nine weeks and will  be conducted at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

In  September  1980  TRADOC's commanding  general  di› rected  an examination  of the  Basic  Noncommissioned  Officer Course for Combat Arms (BNCOC), which  was at the time de› signed  to  produce  a  weapons  and equipment  expert  who  was competent in skill-level-three tasks in a specific combat arms mil› itary  occupational  specialty,  to  ensure  that  hard-hitting  squad leaders, tank commanders, and section leaders were turned out. The examination led to recommendations which were approved in  September  1981  for implementation beginning in  fiscal  year 1982. The revised BNCOC training program places greater em› phasis on graduating specialists who are prepared to lead, train and direct the men under their command. The new course pro› vides a 24-hour-a-day NCO academy environment. Trainer work› shop  instruction  under  the  Battalion  Training  Management System will be expanded to include classes on methods of  instruc› tion  and presentation  of classes.  Diagnostic tests will  be used  to identify weak students who require additional training as well as to  select students who have  demonstrated competency  to serve as assistant instructors. A standard policy for determining grad› uation requirements will also be implemented.

During fiscal year 1981, the Army fielded  Skill Qualification Tests (SQTs) for 613  of 1,145  MOS (military occupational spe› cialty) skill  levels.  Scores on  tests rose  from  61  percent passing in fiscal  year  1980  to  89  percent passing  this  year.  The Army published new policy guidelines for implementing the SQT pro› gram within the reserve components. Despite changes begun in early 1980 and fully implemented by the end of  fiscal year 1981,

the SQT program continued to experience growth pains.  User units  were particularly critical  of the  program's administrative costs, while Army studies showed that the tests resulted in "event› oriented" or  surge training. A GAO (General Accounting Office) audit initiated in  the spring of 1981  focused on these problems. The results of the audit should be available early in fiscal  year 1982.

A  significant achievement  during the  reporting  period was the publication of  common task soldier's manuals for skill levels one through four.  These manuals set standards and conditions for tasks applicable to all soldiers and help to eliminate confusion.

A new program entitled Common Military Training (CMT) has been published in Army Regulation 350-1. CMT centralizes the management of Department of the Army training require› ments and  limits  subjects  to  those  that are absolutely  essential. The program should reduce the multitude of training require› ments  levied  on  the  field  by  Army  staff agencies,  which  have tended  to  diffuse  the  Army's  training  priorities  contained  in Army Training and Evaluation Programs (ARTEPs) and soldier's manuals.

In  October  1980  the  Army  instituted  a  new,  simple  three› item  physical  fitness  test  (pushups,  situps,  and a  two-mile  run) with standards adjusted for the physiological differences between men and women. Since no equipment is required, personnel can now be tested who could not before. More frequent testing can be conducted as well. Initial assessments show that 85  percent of the men and women in the Army are able to pass the test. About 5  percent of the  soldiers  tested reach  the  maximum  score,  in› dicating  that  the  standards  are  challenging.  The  reserve  com› ponents will  phase in  the new test over a two-year period.

A new fitness program for personnel over age forty is  linked to  an  innovative  system  of cardiovascular  screening.  By  using statistics  available  from  the  American  Heart  Association,  the Army identifies personnel at risk  of cardiovascular disease and prescribes additional medical evaluations. Although this program increases the load on  the medical system,  it will  ultimately pro› duce cost savings by identifying personnel with heart disease be› fore a  heart attack, since  preventive treatment is  less  expensive than recovery care. The over-forty program is  not yet available to the reserve components because of limited medical resources to conduct the necessary screening.

The Army continued development of the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California.  Following Fort Irwin's reactivation as a FORSCOM installation on 1  July 1981, the 197th

Infantry Brigade conducted an extended training period (thirty days)  to  check  out  thoroughly  NTC support functions,  equip› ment, and tactical scenarios. In August 1981 construction of the new  live-fire  range  was  completed.  The  range  has  automated targets which can simulate attacking or defending enemy forces while friendly forces maneuver and engage with live fire.  A total of six  battalion  task  forces  (three  brigade rotations)  trained at the NTC in fiscal  year 1981.  Brigade rotations will  increase to eight in fiscal  year  1982, nine in  fiscal  year  1983, and twelve in fiscal  year 1984.

The Army's budget request for fiscal year 1982 included $29 million to acquire approximately 244,000 acres of land for ma› neuver training for the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized). T he training area,  known  as  the Pinon Canyon,  is  located in south› eastern Colorado, about 155 miles from Fort Carson. The project generated considerable  political  interest  and  debate.  Congress held special hearings on the issues. In May  1981, the House Ap› propriations Committee started an investigation of the proposed acquisition. The final  report, completed in July  1981, generally supported the project as being necessary, justified, and feasible.

Conduct of Military  Operations  on  Urbanized  Terrain (MOUT) training for NATO and CONUS-based forces remained limited during fiscal  year 1981  because of a  lack of training fa› cilities.  Construction was  begun,  however,  on  the  Army's first new MOUT training facility at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This facility  should  be  completed  by  the  summer of 1982  and  will serve as a prototype for future construction in FORSCOM, USA› REUR, and WESTCOM. By 1986 all major commands are sched› uled to  have  facilities  for  MOUT training that will  provide the experimental training necessary for validation of doctrine,  indi› vidual and unit performance criteria, and necessary combat de› velopments and testing.

Specialized  training in the active  Army during the past year included U.S. and Allied small unit exchanges and unilateral ex› changes with Canada and the United Kingdom; the presentation of on-the-job and observed training to 100 individuals from fif› teen foreign countries; and the continued revitalization of com› petitive marksmanship in both training and competition. Twelve FORSCOM  infantry  battalions  participated  in  the  three-week Jungle  Orientation course conducted  by  the U.S.  Army Jungle Warfare  Training Center at Fort Sherman  in  the  Republic  of Panama. Four infantry companies and 1,200 soldiers assigned to FORSCOM  major combat units conducted  Arctic  Orientation Training at the U.S.  Army Northern Warfare Training Center,

Fort Greely, Alaska. Four other FORSCOM units-infantry bat› talions-also conducted Arctic Orientation Training. They trained at Fort Wainwright,  Alaska,  under the  Rotational Bat› talion Combat Team Program. Three other brigades conducted cold weather training at Fort Drum, New York.

Exercising, training, and deploying the Army Rapid Deploy› ment  Forces (RDF-A) received  increased  emphasis during the year.  In  October  1980, BRIGHT  STAR  81  demonstrated  rapid deployment and joint and combined readiness of  selected RDF› A units. Headquarters, Rapid DeploymentJoint Task Force, and a  reinforced battalion of the  101st Airborne  Division  deployed to Egypt to evaluate command and control, increase cooperation with the host nation, familiarize personnel with desert environ› ments, evaluate standard operating procedures, and test selected logistical and communications concepts. RDF-A forces also par› ticipated in Exercise GALLANT KNIGHT 81  and in the BRIEF RE› PLY communication exercise.

In  other exercises,  Army  forces  participated  in  eight JCS› directed and thirty-seven JCS-coordinated exercises at a  cost of $51  million in fiscal  year 1981. These included two JCS-directed command post exercises; two major field training  exercises (TEAM SPIRIT  81  and SOLID SHIELD  81); as  well  as large-scale USCIN› CRED field  training exercises in  the continental United States. LOGEX 81, conducted at Fort Pickett, Virginia, during the period 9-22 August 1981, was geared to the command and staff prob› lems of combat support and combat service support (CS-CSS). The exercise  featured an  isolated  U.S.  corps as  a  3 1 /!1-division force with a full complement of  support units in a Central Europe scenario during a  sixty-day  unconventional war.  Approximately 3,300 individual players from  llO active Army and reserve com› ponent units,  the U.S.  Navy,  Marine Corps,  Air Force,  Central Army Group, Southern Command, and USAREUR participated in  the exercise.

The Training Management Control System (TMACS), which was  described  in  last  year's historical  summary,  made progress during the year.  In September 1981, the Pulau Electronics Cor› poration received a contract to provide the  199 computer units that will be required (FORSCOM 101, USAREUR 63, TRADOC 15,  EUSA 13, and WESTCOM 7).  Pulau will conduct operator and programmer training at  Headquarters,  FORSCOM,  using two of the portable desk-top computer units in  October  1981. Five units each will  be delivered to Fort Hood and Fort Carson in  November  1981  to conduct field  testing of the revised soft› ware. Sixteen computers are scheduled for delivery to Fort Leav-

enworth in late December for major command training sessions, and the remaining computers (I  71) will be delivered to the field during 1982 in accordance with major command requirements.

## 4. Intelligence, Automation, and Communications

The technological revolution of the decades since the Second World War has increasingly automated both military intelligence activities and signal communications, to say nothing of other as› pects of the military scene.  While automation thus serves both intelligence  and  communications,  the two  are especially  linked with automation because of their basic need to transmit military information speedily and securely. By fiscal year 1981, the process of  automation was proceeding at an accelerated pace in keeping with the Army's  efforts to modernize its equipment. As one might expect, given the long lead-time required to field the new elec› tronic systems,  much of the Army's modernization of its intelli› gence gathering and signal communications during the reporting year is a  history of research, development, and acquisition pro› grams.  During  the  year,  there  were  also  some  organizational changes.  In  intelligence  matters  there  was  much  attention  to training, particularly in languages, which reflected the continuing worldwide  scope  of the  Army's responsibilities.  Several  of the new systems were joint in nature, with the Army responsible, for example, for the ground stations of global satellite systems. This, too, was a mark of  the continuing concurrence of  joint- and single› service operations.

## Intelligence

The Army continued during the reporting year with its plans to begin  reorganizing  military  intelligence  units  in  the reserve components  in  fiscal  year  1982.  At  the  same  time,  the  Army continued to carry out the recommendations of the Intelligence Organization and Stationing Study of 197  5 concerning the re› organization of certain active units at the corps level and below. Accordingly, in June and September 1981, the Army combined several  tactical  military  intelligence and Army Security Agency units to form  military intelligence (MI) battalions in  support of the  2d,  3d,  8th,  and  24th  Infantry  Divisions,  respectively.  To form these new battalions, the reorganizations combined the 2d Military  Intelligence  Company  and  the  329th  Army  Security Agency Company (Division Support) into the new  102d Ml Bat› talion,  the  3d MI  Company and  the 851st  ASA  Company  into

the 103d MI Battalion, the 8th MI Company and the 415th ASA Company into the 108th Ml Battalion, and the 24th MI Company and the 853d ASA Company into the 124th Ml Battalion. The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command assembled a spe› cial  study team,  with representatives from aJl  Army major com› mands,  to  determine  both  peacetime  and  wartime  intelligence requirements in  echelons above corps.  The team  was expected to report by  the end of December 1981.

Effective  1  April  1981,  the  Army  transferred  the  Current Intelligence Division  of the  U.S.  Army Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center, an activity of the Intelligence and Security Com› mand, to the U.S.  Army Intelligence Operations Detachment, a field operating agency of  the Office of  the Assistant Chief  of  Staff for Intelligence, where it had been lodged for operational control since 24 October 1980. The mission of the Current Intelligence Division  was  to aid  the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Intelligence by providing  and  interpreting  current  intelligence  from  all sources for the Army secretariat, the Army staff, and the major Army commands.  Considerations that influenced  the  return of the division  to  the control  of the assistant chief were  increased reporting requirements stemming from a rise in intelligence ten› sions, the Army staff's need for a reporting capability of  its own, and a desire Lo  reduce the responsibilities of  the Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center.

In  order to retain  civilian  personnel  in  critical overseas  po› sitions  during  times  of national  emergency,  including  persons performing key intelligence services, the Department of  Defense proposed certain policy changes, which  were pending at the end of  fiscal year 1981. The proposed changes would require certain civilians to join the Selected Reserves as a  condition of employ› ment, would extend coverage of the  Uniform Code of Military Justice to key  civilians during periods of emergency, and would permit overseas commanders to require civilians  holding desig› nated positions to remain in place during mobilization or hostil› ities.  The proponents of these changes believed that they would have  a  far-reaching,  positive effect on the readiness of overseas units.

A  personnel  action  pending at the  end of fiscal  year  1980 concerned whether or not to phase out meteorological observers (military occupational  specialty  93E) and replace  them  with ci› vilians, as  had been urged in the plan presented by a  task force set up to recommend improvements in the management of Army meteorological activities.  This proposal interested military intel› ligence authorities, because commanders are necessarily as con-

cerned with  the  weather as  they are with the terrain on  which they might have to fight or with the number of opposing enemy forces.  Because the U.S. Army Materiel Development and Read› iness Command (DARCOM) had urged that meteorological ob› servers  be  replaced  by  artillery  ballistics  observers  (MOS  93F) rather than by civilians, who were in short supply, the task force's plan was not approved by the Vice Chief of  Staff until July 1981. In order to secure its approval the staff dropped the recommen› dation regarding  the  meteorological  observers,  leaving  the  re› sponsibility for resolving this matter to the Deputy Chief  of  Staff for  Research,  Development,  and  Acquisition.  The solution reached by the interested parties, with some compromise before the end of the reporting year, was to begin replacing most of  the meteorological observers with civilians in fiscal  year 1983, even› tually leaving only a few  of these observers with  military status.

During the past year the Army staff has given high priority to the  training of signal  intelligence  personnel  in  a  continuing effort to correct the problems associated with this training, prob› lems that arose from the difficulty of  making peacetime training meaningful.  Inasmuch as most of the active and reserve military intelligence specialists are in combat intelligence units that sup› port tactical forces in  echelons up  to and including corps, their peacetime  training has  generally  been  conducted under condi› tions far different from  those they  would encounter in  wartime operations. Such a situation not only adversely affects individual and unit readiness,  but also fosters job dissatisfaction and a  low reenlistment rate. To deal with this matter, the Army in January 1980 issued a  revision of its regulation on Tactical  Intelligence Readiness Training (AR 350-3), which directed an expansion of the readiness program to include all intelligence disciplines in the reserve components as well as in the active forces.  The purpose of the  program was  to improve  both  individual  and  unit skills necessary  for  combat  intelligence.  To do  this,  the  training  of personnel against real  targets was  emphasized in  order to make training realistic  and to  counter dissatisfaction  stemming from the artificiality of traditional peacetime training.

Opportunities for maintaining or improving individual skills provided  by  the  readiness  program  included  post-apprentice technical courses, self-study foreign language texts and tapes, par› ticipation  in  so-called  live  environment intelligence operations, and specialized operational training conducted by strategic and national intelligence agencies,  all  supplemented  by  educational centers, language laboratories, and foreign language courses. To make training more realistic and practical, the readiness program

provided during the past year for the acquisition of  limited quan› tities of  commercial equipment in lieu of  military equipment not yet in sufficient  supply for regular use. In one activity, intelligence specialists  used  normal  tactical  equipment  to  process  raw  data gathered by sensor-collecting devices,  the data sometimes being transmitted to tactical  units at or near their garrisons. This ac› tivity combined  so-called in-unit and  live  environment  training of a  practical  kind.

To improve training of  communications or signal intelligence personnel, officials designed, as an aspect of  the readiness training program,  the so-called  TROJAN  projects  to  provide  live  signal intelligence training at two installations of  the U.S. Army Forces Command.  Funding for these projects is  for  fiscal  years  19831987,  which  includes funds  for  expanding them  and  for  estab› lishing a  project at another  installation.  Also  funded for  these years  is  a  TROJAN  project  for  Europe,  for  which  U.S.  Army, Europe, urged additional funding for fiscal  year 1982.

To provide for improved intelligence training for the reserve components,  Forces  Command began  to establish  two  consoli› dated training facilities, one at Fort Shelling, Minnesota, and one at  Austin,  Texas.  Each  of these  facilities  was  to  train  reserve intelligence personnel in its general area. Both were to offer live training opportunities including training  afforded by the TROJAN projects.

In fiscal  year  1981, nearly 1,400 en  listed and warrant officer specialists  participated in  live  environment or specialized oper› ational training provided by  the U.S. Army Intelligence and Se› curity Command and national intelligence agencies.  That was a 55-percent increase in participation over the previous fiscal year. Of the  participants, 40 percent were  linguists.  Virtually all  in› telligence personnel in  the active forces and many in the reserve components  participated  in  intelligence  activities  within  their units during the year. Officials responsible for the readiness train› ing program  believed that  the  measures  taken  during the  past year not only increased individual proficiency and unit readiness, but also contributed to the contingency planning of tactical units receiving intelligence support.

As  might  be  expected,  language  training was  of particular importance to the Army, which during the fiscal  year launched a  substantial  program  for  improving its  linguistic  capability for intelligence purposes.  Although  the  results of its  efforts  would not  be  very  fruitful  for  some  time,  fiscal  year  1981 witnessed increased awareness and improvement in  the  management and training of linguists.

To capitalt7e for the first  time on the number of persons in large urban areas c;pcakmg their native foreign tongues, the U.S. Army Recnt1ting Command sent out four teams oflinguists, each to a  different citv-Pittsburgh. Boston. Sacramento, and Santa Ana. l3y 1he end of th&lt;"  yen these teams were able to visit forty› five schools. The Army. working through the U.S. Army Train› ing and  Doctrine  Command  (TRADOC),  sought to  develop  a career management field  for linguists that was geared to a  lan› guage instead of  the  awkward system that Wr\S keyed to a technical skill,  such  as  voice  int&lt;'rceptor. If such  a  career field  were de› veloped  11 wo11ld  h"' po,;sihle to iP1prove and maintain language skills directly as a principal object of management rather than as something incidental to the skill. TRADOC, therefore, set about preparing new descriptions of career fields  96 and  98  (military intelligence and electronic warfare ,ryptological operations) with a view to converting them to linguistic career management fields.

Another problem with  maintaining language skills  was  that speakers of  some langua~es that would be needed in certain con› tingencies  were  scattered  throughout  the  force  structure,  thus making skill  maintenance  training  difficult.  To overcome  this problem, the U .S  Army lntelligence and Security Command be› gan  work on a  laog11age  or~nization  to which  these specialists could he brought for  training.

To pro"i&lt;le speci&lt;ll  incentives  for  linguists-who heretofore could  receive  only  a  se-lective  reenlistment  bonus,  which  had proven  inadequate  for  retaining  linguists  with  much  needed slcills-the  Army  proposPd  skill  shortage  pay,  which  the  fiscal year 1982 defense appropriation bill authorized along with com› ha1  arms pay.  Another matter that impinged on morale and ef› ficiencv  was  the  policy requiring short.  unaccompanied tours in Korea. which resulted in repetitive overseas assignments and fam› tlv turm0il  anrl  provided  little  time  for  the  linguist  to  become familiar with  bis  work. To correct this situation, the Army per› mitt&lt;&gt;d sel("Ct&lt;"'&lt;l linguist&lt;-.  going to certain locations in Korea,  to serve  two-ve;:ir tours  with their  families  accompanying  them. %1c&lt;' the inception of this plan in the summer of J 981, fifteen .;-~Jected Jinguists h;ive  gone to Korea.

Still another infringement on  mor;:i.le  and efficiency  was  the practice of trainin~ tactical  intelligence units in  the continental Unit&lt;'d St;:ites by using recorded, dated intercepts. Informal sur› ve,·s. demonstrating that  working in an actual  intelligence situ› ation resulted in greater  job satisfaction than working in a sterile Pnvironment. led the Army to establish training programs with re;il intellig-ence  missions  at  two  locations  within  the  United

States. U.S. Army, Europe, planned to establish a similar program in fiscal  year  1982.

Previously,  the Office of the  Deputy Chief of Staff for  Op› erations and Plans,  in addition to acting as executive agent for the Defense Foreign Language Program, had served as the Army Service Program Manager for linguists.  In November 1980, the Service Program Manager function was transferred to the Assis› tant Chief of Staff for Intelligence.

Refresher-maintenance  and  intermediate  language  training within the Army is  limited by the resources of the Defense Lan› guage Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) and by the availability of soldiers due for training.  On the other hand, lan› guage training through other federal agencies and at U.S.  and foreign academic institutions is  more economical,  both  in time and money, for soldiers who otherwise would have to move. Re› cognizing this fact,  the Army developed new programs to make use of these options.  Furthermore, the U.S.  Army Intelligence and Security Command took steps during the year to establish the  Foreign  Language  Training  Center,  Europe  (FL  TCE),  in Munich, Germany.

In order for field  commanders to maintain  language profi› ciency within their units on a day-to-day basis, the Army included funds in its fiscal  year  1982 budget to provide diagnostic  tools for determining deficiencies in language skills, remedial training for improving these skills, and performance tests for measuring their development.  In further  support  of these  objectives,  the amended fiscal  year  1982 budget included $1.2  million  for the Defense Language Institute's Foreign Language Center for non› resident language training materials and course design and de› velopment. The Army also planned to start language proficiency sustainment courses in fiscal  year 1982 for German, Arabic, Ko› rean, and Chinese.

A  common deficiency  of language  training  materials  here› tofore had been that they often lacked spontaneity and were out of date in terms of actual linguistic usage. To help this situation, fiscal  year  1982 funds will  permit the Army to use  video tapes of  foreign television broadcasts in language training. In a related development, in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 1981, the Army authorized intelligence personnel to intercept foreign language transmissions  during field  training  exercises.  Previously,  regu› lations had forbidden such use of foreign transmissions; as a  re› sult,  linguists in training were exposed only to English language traffic.

The overseas program provided training for 12  5 students in

thirty countries during fiscal  year 1981. Also during this year the Army established new  training sites  in  Argentina,  Bangladesh, Belgium, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Panama,  Peru, and Sudan, and it initiated negotiations to begin training in the People's Republic of  China and in  Malawi in Sub-Saharan Africa. To accommodate the expansion of  this overseas program, the Army had to increase its  training budget.

In another overseas intelligence  training activity,  the Army and  Air  Force  sent a  technical  assistance  team  of four  people (three from  the Army and one from  the Air Force) to Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia,  to  help  the  Saudi  Arabian  forces  organize  and operate  a  joint  intelligence  school.  The  main  purpose  of this school was to provide training in tactical intelligence and imagery interpretation. During the period April-July 1981, the team set up and conducted one tactical  intelligence course and partially organized another in imagery interpretation. There were prob› lems getting the necessary equipment for the latter course,  but the team expected it to begin on 15 December 1981, early in the new fiscal  year.

Imagery interpretation is an important aspect of intelligence training, dealing as  it does  with  the recognition,  identification, location,  description, and analysis of objects, activities,  and ter› rain represented electronically or on film  or through other me› dia.  To improve Army capabilities in  this  field,  a joint working group made up of  representatives from OACSI, TRADOC, USA› ICS, and INSCOM drafted the U.S. Army Air Intelligence and Imagery Plan during the summer and fall  of 1981,  but did not have it quite ready for approval by the end of  the fiscal year. The study from  which  the plan resulted  reviewed current air intelli› gence and imagery training and recommended changes relating to the Mobile Army Ground Imagery Interpretation Center and several  imagery systems that had been recently introduced.

Before 1975, the Army had limited its  technical training of tactical  signal  intelligence  units  to  ways  that proved  unsatisfac› tory, either because they did not provide day-to-day tactical train› ing or because related requirements took up the time needed for maintaining technical skills.  As  time  went by,  technological ad› vances in communications and automation made alternative ways of training  signal  intelligence  soldiers  more  efficient  and  cost effective.

In 1980, the U.S. Army Intelligence and Secur'ity Command conducted a worldwide evaluation of  the technical health of  U.S. signal  intelligence  units,  which  indicated the need for  new  and effective training. Because of  new technology and training needs,

U.S. Army, Europe, laid down a  requirement for a  signal intel› ligence  electronic  warfare  training simulator  that  would  make use of new technology by  tying both jammers and information collectors with emitter signals controlled from a  single location. This equipment would  pit  the  trainee against a  simulated  but nevertheless realistic signal intelligence problem. In planning for the year immediately ahead,  the Army staff looked  to the pro› curement of these tactical simulators in fiscal  years  1983- 1987 for all  active and reserve combat electronic warfare intelligence units.  The Army regards these units as very important because of their ability,  when  fully  trained and equipped with signal  in› telligence and direction-finding equipment,  to locate an enemy electronically and then to destroy the electronics upon which he depends for exercising his tactical doctrine.

Human intelligence (HUMINT in the jargon of the trade) is intelligence gathered directly by humans, as distinguished from intelligence collected by electronic, photographic, or other phys› ical  "nonhuman" means.  In September 1981, the Deputy Chief of  Staff  for Operations and Plans and the Assistant Chief  of  Staff for Intelligence approved a  draft statement of policies and pro› cedures in the field of human intelligence. Among other things, the statement set forth  the various ways  in which  human intel› ligence  organizations  in  echelons  above  corps  could  meet  the needs of tactical  commanders, and vice  versa.  Of particular im› portance  was  the  draft's validation  of the  need  of corps  com› manders  for  an  organic  long-range  surveillance  ability.  If approved by the Army Electronic Warfare Intelligence Commit› tee  in  1982  as  expected,  the  statement  would  help  shape  the future  human intelligence force structure.

Executive Order 11905, issued by President Gerald R.  Ford on  18  February  1976,  and  Executive  Order  12036,  issued  by PresidentJimmy Carter on 24January 1978, which built on ex› perience with the Ford order, laid down exacting guidelines for conducting  U.S. foreign  intelligence  activities. As President Carter stated when issuing his order:

Our intelligence agencies have a  critical role to play  in  collecting and ana› lyzing information important to our national security interests and, on occasion, acting in direct support of  major foreign  policy objectives.  It is  equally impor› tant, however, that the methods employedbr, these agencies meet constitutional standards protecting the privacy and civil  liberties of U.S.  persons and are in full  compliance with  the faw.

Executive  Order  12036 authorized  the  military  services  to conduct counterintelligence activities  in  coordination  with  the

Federal  Bureau of Investigation  (FBI)  inside  the United States and with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) outside the na› tion's  borders in accordance with procedures agreed upon by the Secretary of  Defense and the Attorney General. Both presidential orders required the executive departments and agencies to bring their  directives  and  regulations  into  conformity  with  the  new guidelines.

On 10 January 1977, in the wake of Executive Order ll905, the Army rescinded Army Regulation 381-150 of 26July 1971, a  broad rather than detailed  guide to the Army's collection  of intelligence  by  human  means.  Delay by the Department of De› fense in  implementing the new presidential requirements caused further delay down  the line.  Department of Defense  Directive 5250.l  and Regulation  5240.l-R, which  deal  with  the policies and procedures pertaining to foreign  intelligence and counter› intelligence, did not come out until November 1979; and 5240.2, which  pertains to the assignment of counterintelligence respon› sibilities to military departments, was not issued until  18 Decem› ber 1979. Consequently,  the Army could not replace AR 381150 with 381-100 and could not issue AR 381-10 and 381-20 until still  later.

On 1 August 1981 the Army put out Army Regulation 381100 on  collecting human intelligence, with an effective date of 1 September 1981. The number of the regulation was changed because the number of  a rescinded regulation cannot be used for five  years.  Without guidelines of its own or of the Department of  Defense, the Army operated on the basis of  national guidelines in the field of  human intelligence during the period 1977 to 1981 as,  in  the final  analysis,  it  always did and still does.

Army Regulation 381-10, on Army intelligence activities as a whole, was almost ready for publication at the end of  fiscal year 1981. Following publication of Department of Defense Directive 5240.2, the Army prepared a revision of Army Regulation 38120 of 10 September 197  5 on counterintelligence operations. This revision implemented 5240.2 and would be ready for publication early  in  calendar year  1982.  For  the  record,  the  new  381-10 used  the number of a  1967  regulation, on channels of commu› nication with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, that had been superseded by  381-20 of 1975. The new revision  included the old  delimitations  agreement  of  1949  between  the  intelligence agencies of the  military services and the Federal  Bureau of In› vestigation,  which  formed a  part of 381-20 of 1975, as revised in  1979.

Counterintelligence  support  to  Army  operational  security

programs had a high priority for at least five years preceding the reporting year. Emphasis with respect to counterintelligence sup› port of  operational security, however, has changed since the mid1970s, from  a  determination  of what may  have  been  compro› mised in units and installations to an emphasis on giving advice and assistance  in  security  matters.  It is  hoped that this new ap› proach will  prevent the loss of  sensitive information rather than merely document such a loss, as sometimes happened in the past.

Major accomplishments in counterintelligence support of  op› erational security during the past fiscal  year were in two broad areas:  there was a marked increase in senior-level support of  the operational security  program in  general  and  of counterintelli› gence support in  particular;  and  there was  a  shift in  priorities from counterintelligence support of the Army in general to sup› port  of research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation  activities within the continental United States, which became the premier counterintelligence  priority.  At  year's end  this  counterintelli› gence support to research and its related activities was  expected to  continue,  with  emphasis  on  early  identification  of sensitive programs in order to support them throughout their course.

Intelligence support of  the Army continued to depend a great deal upon automated data processing. An example of computer use in  the reporting year was  the success of the Intelligence In› formation Subsystem  (a  part of the Intelligence Data  Handling System), which the Army had fielded in  1979 as its first mobile all-source automated means of intelligence support. In field  ex› ercises  the  subsystem  supported  both  the  U.S.  Army,  Europe (USAREUR), and the Central Army Group of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

In  the  case  of the  Intelligence  Data  Handling  System,  the Office of  the Assistant Chief of  Staff for Intelligence carried out its management responsibilities in various ways.  It upgraded ex› isting  minicomputers  of  the  U.S. Army  Western  Command (WESTCOM), the lntelligence Threat Analysis Center, the For› eign  Science  and  Technology  Center,  and  the  U.S.  European Command (EU  COM). It also took steps to install at existing sites such  additional  peripheral  equipment  as  tape  and  disk  drives, multiplexers, terminals,  printers, and printer-plotters. At year's end there was a telecommunications satellite link between Korea and the Commander in Chief, Pacific, in Hawaii; a minicomputer was  being installed at Arlington Hall Station to link the Intelli› gence Security Command and the Army Operations Center in the  Pentagon;  the  Naval  Photo  Interpretation Center  was  in› stalling a cathode ray tube to put the Photo Center on-line with

the Army Operations Center; and the Army had  committed funds to upgrade the Analyst Intelligence Display and Orientation Sys› tem in  Germany.  Also  at year's end  the Army Threat and In› telligence  Production  System  was  in  the  definition  and  design phase; and the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command had agreed to the extension of  its jurisdiction to include the Depart› ment of  Defense Intelligence Information System and the Army's Intelligence Data Handling System.

Extensive  computerization  of the  Army's intelligence  func› tion  can  also  be  seen  in  the  continuation  of Project  ASSIST (Army System for Standard Intelligence Support Terminals), un› der which it released to the field  new automatic data program› ming,  designated  Version  4.1,  and  then  proceeded  with  the development of  Version 5.0. This latter version, when developed, will simplify the access of  intelligence analysts to large data bases at remote computer sites.  As  the year ended, the International Nickel Company (INCO, Inc.) was under a multiyear contract to carry on the work under Project ASSIST in  the areas of main› tenance and improvement, technical support for intelligence in› stallations outside the continental United States, personnel training,  and  administration,  including  required  reporting  of contract status. INCO, lnc.'s work covered simplification of ma› chine  instructions,  modification  of  Bunker  Ramo  Company's Model 1569, provision of  an information exchange with Datanet 355, a computer security system, programming for linkage with the Defense Intelligence Agency's  on-line system, as well as other technical  services.  Other developments under  Project  ASSIST included the upgrading of major computer equipment at Head› quarters, European Command, which involved the replacement of  several minicomputers, and increasing computer and message capacity by the use of  a wideband circuit and multiplexer at both EUCOM and USAREUR headquarters.

In the control and analysis of  signal intelligence by automated data processing before 1980, each of  the military services pursued its  own  course.  As  might be expected,  this  led  to  considerable duplication of  effort and increased costs. In  an attempt to develop a more efficient approach, the National Security Agency brought the services together early in 1980 and directed them to identify their signal  control and analysis needs and to eliminate duplica› tion.  The services  approved a joint statement of requirements which  they  submitted  for  approval  by  the  National  Security Agency in August 1981.

The Army not only pushed forward on several  intelligence fronts during the past fiscal  year but, as  the Department of De-

fense executive agent, also opened, on 15 December 1980, a new remote  triservice  intelligence  facility  in  a  huge  three-story  un› derground structure adjacent to Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Air Base at Kunia, on Central Oahu, Hawaii. Before opening the facility,  which  represented  a  significant advance  in  intelligence operations  in  the area,  the  Army  had  to  renovate  part of the third floor of  the structure that housed it. At the end of  the fiscal year expansion of the new facility  was  in progress as plans con› tinued for  renovating  the remainder of the third floor,  part of the second floor, and a major part of  the first floor. The  structure had been built after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as an underground parking facility for military aircraft.

Military intelligence personnel had representatives in several groups, including the Operations Subcommittee and the Imagery Planning Subcommittee of the  Committee on  Imagery  Recon› naissance and Exploitation,  which was  reorganized to provide a more timely response to the requirements of  the intelligence com› munity. Managing the current collection and exploitation needs of imagery intelligence was  the responsibility of the Operations Subcommittee; reviewing long-range requirements for collection and exploitation,  for  the  purpose of making recommendations to the parent committee, was the responsibility of the Imagery Planning Subcommittee. Army representation in another work› ing group led to the lifting of limitations on the timely and wide› spread dissemination of overhead imagery. The group expected to publish  the  first  section  of its  findings  in  late  1981  or early 1982.

The Office  of the  Assistant  Chief of Staff for  Intelligence participated in the departmental management of  the Army's  Tac› tical  Exploitation  of National  Capabilities  Program,  which  pro› vided for the development of  connections between Army tactical organizations and national intelligence sources. An important oc› currence  in  these  matters  was  the  redeployment of the  digital imagery  testbed-a prototype  or  experimental  system  for  re› ceiving  imagery  from  various  sensors  to  use  in  the  timely  ex› ploitation of imagery-from Europe to its future home with the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Before its redeployment to the XVIII Airborne, the testbed,-in a very suc› cessful  demonstration,  supported  CERTAIN  RAMPART,  a  field training exercise  of the  VII  Corps;  REFORGER,  the annual  mo› bility  exercise; and Exercise  SHOCK  WAVE  of the  U.S.  European Command. This action provided both contingency support for REFORGER and training that was useful in developing the Tactical Imagery Exploitation System.

The Army also sent a  representative to help revise the Joint Chiefs of Staff Test Plan  to Assess  the Capabilities of National Intelligence Systems to Support Tactical Requirements. The re› vision allowed the unified and specified commands and services to  recommend exercises as vehicles for special  projects and,  of particular importance, to add teeth and flexibility to the old doc› ument by establishing a procedure through which the  Joint Chiefs could take corrective action. The Imagery Intelligence Division, Office of  the Assistant Chief of  Staff for Intelligence, as the staff agency primarily responsible for Army actions under the revised document,  coordinated  Army  personnel,  communications,  and funding for special project CONSTANT HORIZON, the vehicle for which  was ULCHI-FOCUS LENS 81, a command post exercise of Combined Forces Command in Korea. CONSTANT HORIZON proved to be a  milestone  in  the improvement of national intel› ligence support in the Korean theater.

The Imagery Intelligence  Division was  also  the agency pri› marily responsible for  the  Army's participation  in  the Defense Reconnaissance Support Program. This was a  major functional program which had been established within the tactical and other related  intelligence activities  of the  Department of Defense  to improve satellite  reconnaissance  support  of operational  forces. The division  responded  to  planning,  programming, and  budg› etary  matters arising under this  program in  coordination  with the Vice Chief, the Chief of Staff, the Undersecretary, and the Secretary of the Army.

The National Security Agency annually awards its director's trophy to the  tactical  and mobile  military  cryptologic collector that contributed the most significant signal intelligence data dur› ing the previous calendar year.  Although the Army did not win this  award  for  1980,  its  nominee-the  372d  Army  Security Agency Company,  25th  Infantry  Division,  Schofield  Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii-won the runner-up trophy,  which  the director presented during ceremonies at Fort Meade, Maryland.

## Automation

In order to consolidate  management of command, control, communications, and computers under one head, as previously planned,  the Army staff established,  effective  I  October  1981, the office of the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans,  C4, and  assigned  these  functions  to  him.  He  would also have membership on certain key committees of Headquar› ters,  Department of the Army. The staff placed this important

new  office  in  Operations  and  Plans,  because  the  functions  in› volved were important to operations.

Specific legislation (Public Law 89-306) and regulations pro› vided the authority and procedures for acquiring automated data processing equipment along with its necessary programming and maintenance.  The body of applicable regulations included Fed› eral  Property  Management  Regulations,  Federal  Procurement Regulations,  Defense  Acquisition  Regulations  (together  with Army supplements),  and  Army  Regulations.  Army  Regulation 18-1,  ·  "Army Automation  Management,"  15  August  1980, set forth  basic  policies and responsibilities and delegated authority for  managing Army automation.  This regulation and others in the same series established policies and procedures for most au› tomation in the Army. During the past year the Army published a  number of technical bulletins on various aspects of  automation management.  One of these,  technical  Bulletin  18-100,  "Army Automation Life Cycle Management," 15 August 1981, provided a systematic and disciplined approach to the management of the entire  life  cycle  of automated  data  processing projects.  These regulations and bulletins, based on Department of Defense  Di› rectives 5100.40 and 7920.1, together with Instruction 7920.2, covered  the  use  of computers for  logistical  and  other general purposes.  They  were  not concerned  with  so-called  embedded computers-such as those built into weapons systems, those used by the Corps of Engineers in carrying out its civil works respon› sibilities, or those  used  by activities  financed  through  unappro› priated funds-all of which  were handled separately.

Among the provisions  of Army  Regulation  18-1  were  de› scriptions of the classes of  automated data processing equipment as  well  as  costs  and acquisition  authority.  Acquisition authority not delegated  to  heads of Army staff agencies and  major com› manders  remained  under  the  Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management.  In these cases, the  U.S.  Army Computer Systems Selection and Acquisi› tion  Agency was  responsible  for actual acquisition.

Logistical  planning anticipated an  accelerated  effort  in  the next decade to improve the operational capability of the Army's field  forces  by  introducing complex automated data processing of even  the  "embedded" kind,  which  forms an integral part of communications equipment and weapons systems, as well as the self-contained kind. To accomplish these purposes, the Army for› mulated and published Department of  the Army Letter 700-811, "Logistic Support Policy for Automatic Data Processing Equip› ment,"  30 April  1981,  which,  with  any  revisions that might be

required,  would  provide  needed  guidance  for  the  foreseeable future.

In  logistical  planning in  the field,  both functional  and indi› vidual systems automation plans, as part of  the Army Automation Planning, Programming, and Evaluation System, played impor› tant roles in obtaining recognition for automated systems as in› tegral parts of the comparable DOD evaluation system. In July 1981, the Office of the Deputy Chief for Logistics submitted to the  Office  of the  Assistant  Chief of Staff for  Automation and Communications  four  functional  and  sixteen  individual  plans, about the same number that had been submitted during fiscal year 1980.

Procurement  of automated  data  processing  equipment  re› ceived substantial attention during the past year at most of the sites in the Base Operating System, together with other selected sites,  as  well as at European area communications sites.  Of the first  category there were approximately forty-seven  sites  in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Panama that had obsolescent IBM 360 computers. The obsolescent equipment at these places,  which  provided the Army with nontactical admin› istrative,  logistical,  and financial  processing, was completely sat› urated, thus  becoming difficult to maintain and inadequate for mobilization. To deal  with this situation the Army staff and se› lected major commands jointly developed the high-priority Ver› tical  Installation Automation Baseline (VIABLE) Project, which laid  down  a  procurement  schedule  through  fiscal  year  1984. Army proponents of this  project  were confident that it would alleviate  the  problems caused  by  failing  equipment and  would enable the Army to obtain new equipment, at low operating costs, through open and competitive bidding.

Management of the project was according to the guidelines set forth  in  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-109, which  encourages  the  use  of industrial  solutions  to  problems faced  by  government  agencies.  This  policy  required  early  in› volvement of the automated data processing industry in  the ac› quisition program. After extensive review of the project within the  government,  industrial  proposals  for  projects  were  the  re› sponsibility,  first,  of the VIABLE Source  Selection  Evaluation Board and,  finally,  of the  In-Process  Review  Board, which  re› ported, with its recommendations, to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management. The evolution was in two phases:  one phase evaluated concepts and possible solutions as  well as compliance with requirements;

the other was  an actual demonstration.  As  the year ended,  the project was  in  the second, or testing,  phase.

In the case of  the European area communications sites during the past year, the Army replaced all fixed International Business Machine (IBM) 360 computers with automated data processing equipment from  that company's 4300 Series.  It also  made  im› provements in  the mobile equipment by upgrading the 360/30 computers of  the division-level combined services support system in the 8th Infantry Division to a 360/40 central processing unit. This upgrading was done in August 1981 by leasing government› owned  equipment,  which  brought about  at least  a  25-percent improvement in processing time.  As the year ended, there were plans to upgrade similarly the  360  /30 equipment of the other three divisions and of  the three separate brigades of U.S.  Army, Europe.  Also at that time, there was  $14 million in  the Army's fiscal  year  1982  budget for  five  so-called  Interim Theater Au› tomatic Data Processing Service Center systems. These would be mobile systems  using equipment of the 4300 Series and  would be located in  the 200th Theater Army Maintenance Command at Zweibruecken, the 21st Support Command at Kaiserslautern, the 7th Medical Command at Karlsruhe, the 1st Personnel Com› mand at Schwetzinger, and the 4th Transportation Command at Oberursel. The new systems  were not expected to be  in  place, · however, until the last quarter of 1983, but once established they would be able to meet wartime needs.

In the case  of the fifty-one  nondivisional direct support and general support sites in Europe, the Army had, by the end of the fiscal  year,  all  but completed replacement of the National  Cash Register  500  equipment  with  that  of the  Decentralized  Auto› mated  Service  Support  System.  This  system  was  Honeywell's Level 6 computer, with certain specialized features,  mounted in a mobile 35-foot semitrailer, which figured prominently in a plan to replace equipment in the higher echelons of the Army in Eu› rope.

This plan was the Army Combat Service Support Automation and Communications Transition Plan, FY  81-88, which at first was  called simply  the Combat Service Support Transition Plan. The U.S.  Army  Logistics  Center developed  it  with  assistance from the Soldier Support Center, the U.S.  Army Signal School, and the Health Services Command; the plan was expected to be integrated into the Army Command and Control Master Plan by early 1983. As submitted to the Combined Army Development Agency and distributed in September 1981,  the transition plan would provide a procedure for eventually replacing existing au-

tomated data processing systems  in  field  combat support  units with two basic types of computer equipment.

One type of equipment was an expanded version of the De› centralized Automated Service Support System (DAS3), designed to meet the data processing needs of  combat service support units at  divisional,  corps,  and  theater  levels  of operation;  the  other type  was  the similar Division  Level  Data Entry Device.  The ex› panded version of the Decentralized Automated Service Support System  was  intended  to replace  the mobile  IBM  360  /30 com› puters and the UNIVAC 1005 computers in divisions of  both the active Army and the reserve components and also to replace the SPECTRA 70-15 computers at the ports. The plan helped users to define requirements for developing, testing, fielding, and in› tegrating  combat  service support and automated communications for all Army organizational levels in the field.  In addition, it was a  guide  to  those  concerned  with  combat service  support auto› mated communications to help bring about a system that would be interoperable with the Battlefield Automated System, as pro› vided in  the Army Battlefield Interface Concept.

To meet the needs of field  commanders for automatic and precise information on the location of  friendly forces,  the Army and the other military  services developed a  program that,  fol› lowing a series of  tests, could be operational by 1988. The Army's name  for  the  proposed  program,  the  Army  Data  Distribution System, was much shorter than the combined name of the parts that formed the whole: the Position Location Reporting Systems, a combined Army-Marine Corps program; and the  Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, an Air Force, Navy, and Army program. The full name of the composite system came from put› ting these two names together and adding the word hybrid. In its own shorthand, however, the military referred to it as PJH. The Position  Location  Reporting System  of the  Army  and  Marine Corps  would  serve  soldiers  on  foot,  in  surface  vehicles,  or in aircraft  by  giving  them  their  own  location  as  well  as  that  of friendly units or other similar information. It would use a master station, an alternate master station, and  units  in  manpacks,  ve› hicles, and aircraft. The proponents of  this system completed the second phase of its developmental testing at Fort Huachuca, Ar› izona, in September 1981, and at the end of the year they were completing  the  second  phase  of its  operational  testing at  Fort Hood, Texas.  With  an  Army  review  scheduled for  September 1982, the Army expected the system to be ready in  1986.

The  Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, the other part of  the composite system, was a triservice program to develop

a digital data information distribution system that would provide secure  communications for  navigation  and  identification. Through this system,  information would be distributed at high speed. Its management was through a joint program office, with the Air Force as the lead service.

The composite system was developed to satisfy the need for communications able to support existing and  programmed au› tomated systems for maneuver control, air defense, fire support, intelligence electronics warfare, and combat service support.  It is a computer-based system providing real-time, secure data com› munications,  identification, and position  location and reporting information to the tactical forces  with  rapid response times,  re› sistance to jamming, security, and low levels of mutual interfer› ence with users of voice communications.

Another system in its early stages was the Theater Army Med› ical  Management Information System. This was a complete sys› tem designed to provide operational support and command and control information regarding medical  resources on the battle› field. Intended for use by major commands in a war zone, it could also  be  used  by  subordinate commands,  hospitals,  and medical reserve units. Within the overall structure there were subsystems concerned with medical logistics, medical regulating, patient ac› counting and  reporting,  and  whole  blood  management.  In its final  form  the system  would have both manual and automated features and would be used to acquire, process, and disseminate information that would assist  tactical and medical  commanders in managing their medical resources. It would also connect with the Army Standard Supply System to exchange logistical infor› mation, with the Army Personnel System to exchange personnel and  accounting  casualty  reporting  information,  and  with  the Combat Service Support Command and Control System to ex› change command and control information.  Initially  the system would use the Honeywell Level 6 computer of  the Decentralized Automated Service Support System in the medical supply optical and maintenance units and at the medical  command levels;  the Division Level  Data Device, an IBM Series  1 computer, was en› visioned at all treatment facilities and command and control units. Eventually both would be replaced by military computers.

The Academy of Health Sciences and the Office of the Sur› geon  General  developed  a  product  manager's charter for  this system  before the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  at  which  time  it  was awaiting  approval  by  the  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  for Installations, Logistics,  and  Financial  Management.  As  envi› sioned, the system  would use extensive telecommunications and

mobile equipment that would not require environmental condi› tioning to operate. At year's end, preliminary contract work was expected to get under way  in  fiscal  year  I  982.

## Communications

Since communications have become highly automated in  re› cent years,  the decision  as  to whether some subjects should be grouped under automation or communications is  often  purely arbitrary. However, in some cases the subjects fall naturally into one category or the other, as is the case with communications for tactical  nuclear forces.  As  the executive agent for  communica› tions supporting tactical nuclear forces in Europe, the Army con› tinued to develop and implement a series of projects to upgrade existing facilities. It expanded the voice conference system of  the U.S. European Command and added a secure record capability; procured and installed  new  high-frequency radios for  the  EU› COM special purpose network, known as the Cemetery Net; com› pleted the  final  testing  of new  satellite  communications  in preparation for deployment to Europe in fiscal  year  1982; and continued a  new  program to develop improved high-frequency radios for  mobile  forces.  The new  radios  permit easier opera› tions, higher reliability, and increased maintainability. These ra› dios  are  being developed in  such  a  way  as  to allow  for  future modifications of  a frequency-hopping capability which offers bet› ter protection and significantly improved resistance to jamming.

In another effort to upgrade military communications in Eu› rope, the Department of  Defense secured approval from the Fed› eral  Republic  of Germany,  in  a  1978  memorandum  of understanding  with  its  Minister  of Posts  and  Telecommunica› tions, to procure 112 electronic digital telephone switches for use in modernizing the European Telephone System (ETS) network. The Army procured nineteen of  these switches in fiscal year 1981 to add to the six obtained the previous year.  The acquisition of equipment for such a large network must be accomplished over several  years.  At  year's end, one switch  had been cut over and was  operational in Garlstedt.

By  means of the Telecommunications Plan for the Improve› ment of Communications in Korea, the  United States launched an ambitious effort to improve its military communications in the Republic  of Korea.  This project would  be accomplished  by  in› tegrating U.S. communications with those of Korea, thereby es› tablishing a  highly  protected,  high-quality  communications system capable of  supporting the military forces of  both countries

under normal, crisis, and wartime conditions. The plan, dated in 1980, was approved by the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February 1981. The Army would be the lead military service in carrying out this plan and, accordingly, turned to the U.S. Army Communications Command at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to un› dertake  the  work.  By  the end of the fiscal  year  the  work  had been funded, and preliminary engineering such as site and route surveys  for  cable  trunks  and  technical  control  equipment  was under way in Korea.

To manage its far-flung commitments, the United States op› erated the Worldwide  Military Command and  Control System, in support of  which the Army continued to expand its automated data processing capabilities. This system provided an automated means  for  exchanging command and control  information  that supported decision  making at  the  highest  military  levels.  The medium for coordinating the decision-making effort was a sub› system in the form of an intercomputer network connecting the information systems that served planning, logistics,  intelligence, readiness and mobilization  management,  deployment, and sup› port of forces.  The Army improved the capacity of the network to deploy and support forces by extending its connections to east and west coast ports through the command and control facilities of the Military Traffic  Management Command. The Army im› proved its  support of this system  by  upgrading the automated data processing equipment at Headquarters, Department of the Army, and at other  key facilities to provide increased data stor› age, better processing, and additional local and remote terminals. In supporting the reconfiguration of  the intercomputer network, begun during the last half of the fiscal  year,  the Army tried to improve reliability and performance by upgrading transmission rates of selected circuits, rerouting other circuits, and activating additional ones. The scheduled date for completing this recon› figuration was June 1982. lnjuly 1981, the Army began surveys at the command headquarters of worldwide command and con› trol sites to determine future information needs in the functional areas of nuclear operations, resource and unit monitoring, and conventional planning and execution for the period after 1985. The survey results, in part, will  help determine the Worldwide Command and Control Information System that will replace the present worldwide system.

Another advanced military communications system of  the pe› riod was the NAVST AR (Navigation Satellite Timing and Rang› ing)  Global  Positioning System,  which  would  provide  accurate three-dimensional position information to its users anywhere on

or near earth. This system consists of  a space segment, made up of eighteen satellites; a control segment, formed by control and monitor stations within the continental United States; and a user segment,  composed  of a  manpack  and a  surface  vehicle  or an aircraft. Its development was a DOD program in which all services participated.  Designated  a  major  system,  it  was  under  a  joint program office with  the Air Force as the lead service. At year's end there were six satellites in orbit which could provide position information to the model user equipment sets located worldwide. Full-scale  engineering  and  development  contracts  had  been awarded in June 1979 to the competing contractors-Rockwell International/Collins and Magnavox. The Army would use  the system with manpack, vehicular, and airborne sets to update and complement other position-navigation sets planned for the Army. Target dates for achieving operational status were 1987 for two› dimensional positioning, or limited capability, and 1988 for three› dimensional positioning, or full  capability.

During fiscal  year  1981,  the  Army,  as  the  executive agent, continued to meet its responsibilities for the ground equipment of  the Defense Satellite Communications and the Tactical Satellite Communications System. These were closely related projects con› cerning  both  strategic  and  tactical  communications,  with  the Army developing the ground  equipment,  the Air Force devel› oping and launching the space system, and the Navy developing systems  unique  to  its  own  needs.  In  such systems,  the satellite serves as a relay station between two terminals; therefore, terrain is  much less a consideration than it is  in ordinary terrestrial sys› tems.

In carrying out its responsibilities under the Defense Satellite Communications System,  which  would provide secure point-to› point long-haul  communications,  the  Army  in  fiscal  year  1981 took possession  of four  medium satellite ground  terminals and anticipated the installation of  seventeen more in fiscal years 198  2 and  1983. These terminals were of a  model known  by  its joint nomenclature AN/GSC-39. Also during the year, the Army se› cured the authority to procure twenty-two new satellite terminals, which would lead to the replacement of  the old terminals (known as  AN/MSC-46  and  AN/TSC-54)  dating  from  1962-1964. The  Army  obtained  six  new  transportable  terminals  (Model AN/TSC-86) during the fiscal year and expected to deliver them to  the  field  the following  year.  The Army also  fielded  the first shipment of Model  AN/USC-28 jam-resistant equipment and planned to deliver and install an additional forty-eight sets world› wide in  the  next year.  By  installing six  digital  communications

subsystems  during  the  reporting  year,  the  Army  increased  to forty-nine the number of such  units deployed.

The Army awarded a  contract to develop connecting links with  Defense  Satellite  Communications  System  control,  which would lead to a later procurement contract. There were numer› ous  joint actions approved during fiscal year 1981  to increase the capability and flexibility of  the system in support of  both the new Rapid  Deployment Joint Task  Force and its  Army component. Developmental efforts begun in fiscal  year  1981  would provide the system with an extremely high frequency capability by 1990. With  award of the terminal contract and related support con› tracts in fiscal year 1982, the high-frequency modernization pro› gram would carry the system into the next century. Meanwhile, to guarantee the continuity of its work, the Army projected fu› ture construction and personnel requirements and initiated the necessary planning, programming, and budgeting.

The program for developing the Tactical Satellite Commu› nications System has two phases, initial and objective. In the initial phase,  the  Army  would  field  two  single-channel  systems  in  the ultra high frequency range and one multichannel system in the super  high  range.  The  single-channel  Special  Communication System, or AN/MSC-64 as it was  designated,  was  in full-scale production in fiscal year 1981, with a scheduled completion date of 1983;  it  would  provide  secure  command and  control  com› munications from the National Command Authority to various special units all over the world. At the end of the fiscal year, the Army awarded a production contract for the second of  the single› channel systems, AN/PSC-3, a man-portable system for Ranger and Special  Forces  units.  The Multi-Channel  Initial  System,  or AN/TSC-85A and 93A, would provide communications down to brigade level.  Its procurement was to end in  1983. Following its  procurement and delivery in the field,  low-rate multiplexers and jam-resistant features would be added.

In the second, or objective,  phase of this project,  the Army would field one single-channel and one multichannel system. The first,  called the Single Channel Objective Tactical Terminal, an extremely  high frequency  system,  was  in  an  advanced  state  of development at year's end.  Its fielding would depend upon the availability of  a satellite suited to its range. At the end of  the year the Multi-Channel Objective System,  which would also  operate in the extremely high frequency range, was still  in  the concept validation stage.

Another joint communications effort was made in support of the Joint Tactical Communications Program which, when all  its

subsystems are integrated, will  provide a  large-scale, automatic, and secure digital system.  Subsystems  for  which  the  Army was responsible  included  the  AN/TTC-39  circuit  switch  and  AN/ TYC-39 message switch, on which General Telephone Electric Sylvania began production during fiscal  year 1981  under a con› tract calling for  six  of the circuit switches and eighteen of the message switches. The Army also had charge of the Single Sub› scriber Terminal, for  which  Singer Librascope  won  a  full-scale development contract in  1980.  Not only did Singer Librascope keep production on schedule during the year,  but it proposed a cost-effective value engineering change that would reduce com› plexity  and  costs  throughout  the  life  cycle  of the  equipment. Under this joint program the  Army also had responsibility for the equipment and assemblages of  the Digital Group Multiplexer, which it decided to produce in fiscal year 1981. There were prob› lems with some proposed Army subsystems, which were still un› resolved at the end of the year, including a Canadian protest in one case.

Experience  with  the  Automated  Tactical  Frequency  Engi› neering System, an Army undertaking, was to influence future concept  development efforts  associated  with  the Joint Tactical Communications System. This latter system was standardized for operating across all services for both voice and record traffic; it would use various kinds of  equipment, including secure and non› secure  telephones,  multichannel  radios,  teletype,  and  facsimile equipment. The Automated Tactical Frequency Engineering Sys› tem was a  project initiated by the  U.S.  Army Communications› Electronics Command and begun in  1980 to define, develop, and evaluate automated tactical communications-electronics planning and engineering capabilities.  The Army field-tested the system and, during the reporting period, installed one  terminal at the Department of Defense Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center and another with the 5th Signal Command.

Still another very important  joint program in which the Army had  a  role was  that of supporting the Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems QINTACCS) program. In May  1981, the Commander in  Chief, Atlantic, conducted an operational effectiveness demonstration of the intelligence seg› ment of this system as  part of  joint exercise Soun SHIELD  '81. Specifically  tested  in  the  exchange  of intelligence  information among service operational facilities were message standards that had been developed for JINTACCS. Under direction of  the  Joint Chiefs of  Staff, development of  message standards, known as Tac› tical Digital Information Link-J, continued for the  Joint Tactical

Information Distribution System; during the past year,  the ser› vice and defense agencies reached agreement on a schedule for further  work  in  this  area.  AJso  continuing  through  1981  was installation  of the Joint  Interface  Test  System  of JINT  ACCS. Once the system has been installed at Fort Monmouth, New Jer› sey, configuration management testing, which in  1981  was done at the Navy's testing facility at San Diego, will  be moved to Fort Monmouth.

In  the area of combined operations, JINT  ACCS continued to  support  U.S.  delegations  to  seventeen  bodies  of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization with direct technical assistance in developing  command  and  control  system  standards  for  inter› operability.  Efforts  were successful  in preparing a  program for the  interoperability  of artillery  automatic  data  processing  sys› tems;  at  the direction  of the Joint  Chiefs  of Staff,  responsible parties surveyed  the  requirements to support  the development of  standards for interoperability with the command and control systems of our Pacific allies.

The Maneuver Control System is  being developed to aid op› erations officers  at upper and lower  levels  of command in  the control of  the tactical maneuver force. Work on this system began in 1980 with the deployment to Europe of  a baseline system using tactical computer systems and terminals.  Initially deployed with three tactical computer terminals, the fielded  prototype system grew to seventeen computer terminals and three computer sys› tems. Operational programming and functional capabilities grew as  the  entire  program  evolved and  benefited  from  continuous feedback by field users.

Of  basic importance in the Army's  efforts to modernize com› munications was its research and development program for equip› ping infantry, armor, field artillery, and aviation units with radios to replace frequency-modulated equipment that not only was dif› ficult  to  maintain,  but also  could  not efficiently  pass  on digital data from other command and control systems. The vehicle for this effort was the Single Channel Ground Airborne Radio Sub› system,  which  would be both resistant to jamming and capable of  being secured for voice transmission. After an extensive review of  this program during the reporting period, the Army concluded that it should be continued as planned despite a $13-million short› fall  in funding as  well as other considerations. In particular, this decision involved maintaining the current schedule for the basic radio  within  available  funds,  as  well  as  reprogramming  within congressional limitations and transferring funds from other proj› ects. Under this plan the Army would develop the basic receiver-

transmitter module of  all three contractors for the manpack and vehicular  sets,  together  with  their  electronic  counter-counter› measure  modules, and would defer the effort of all  three con› tractors  on  some  or  all  of  their  proposed  refinements-the aircraft receiver-transmitter subsystem, the communications se› curity  unit,  and  the  securable  remote-control  unit.  Finally,  in September 1981, the Army and the contractors agreed upon new contracts reflecting the new conditions.

A major concern of  military communications is security. Dur› ing fiscal year 1981 the Army took action to secure all frequency› modulated  radio  nets  from  theater  to  battalion  levels.  At  the year's end this  effort  was  well  under  way,  but problems arose because of the  incompatibility  of the new  VINSON  communi› cations security equipment with the widely used NESTOR equip› ment. To solve this problem the Army decided to distribute the VINSON equipment in such a way as to put the greatest possible distance between the two sets of equipment.

At every level of  military activity, as in society at large, things are vastly  more complex now than in  the simpler past of only a few  decades ago.  This  is  certainly true in  both military intelli› gence and  signal  communications,  as  well  as  in  the  steady  im› provement of the  automated systems  that  transmit  their information from soldiers to command posts and to headquarters in  the field  and at home,  or wherever required,  sometimes on the other side of  the earth. Because the systems are so complex, much time is required from conception, authorization, research, development, testing, evaluation, and production to regular field use.  Training personnel and units also takes time.  Consequently, the Army systems that were only in the early stages of their life cycles during the reporting period would not be fielded and fully operational for several years. Training also would not be accom› plished overnjght either in languages, for example, or in the use of new equipment not yet fielded. The new undertakings would go forward,  however, as  the Army maintained the old and pur› sued the unending process of  keeping its personnel, organization, and equipment ready  for  any contingency in matters of intelli› gence,  automation,  and signal  commurucations,  as  in  all  other areas of its  concern.

## 5.  Manning the Army

In fiscal  year  1981  the Army continued to reverse a  variety of unfavorable personnel trends that had set in after the end of the Vietnam War. Although in the previous fiscal year the active Army had an average undermanning of 16,900, it was only 164 below the active duty strength authorized by Congress. In fiscal year  1981  the  active  Army  not  only  met  its  overall  recruiting goals  but also  retained,  at year's end,  more  military  personnel than programmed, in part because of the anticipated large fiscal year 1982 pay raise as well as other benefits.

The active Army entered fiscal year 1981 with an authorized end strength of 775,300 men and women.  To capitalize  on its improved recruiting and retention rates, the Army requested and received congressional authorization to increase the active duty end strength of 780,000. The active Army actually achieved an end strength of 781,042, or 1,042 above the final authorization and 5,742 above the initial authorization.

During fiscal year 1981  the active Army was  manned on the average at 100.6 percent of  authorizations, with an average over› manning of  4,100 for the year. On 30 September 1981, the active Army was manned as  follows:

|                                                 | Authorized Strength   | Actual Strength   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Officers... . ... . . .. .. ... .. . . ........ | 101,410               | 101,477           |
| Enlisted Personnel ..... ... . ..               | 674,173               | 675,083           |
| U.S. Military Academy Cadets                    | 4,417                 | 4,482             |
| Total ....... . ...... . .. . ....              | 780,000               | 781,042           |

The growth  in  the  active  Army  paralleled  increases  in  the Army Reserve and Army  National Guard.  At the end of fiscal year 1981  the Army Reserve reported an increase in end strength of 25,896 (the total of  ready, standby, and retired reserves). The Army  National  Guard  reported  an  end  strength  increase  of 25,742. The end strength of Army ready reserves not on active duty (both National Guard and Army Reserve) rose in fiscal year 1981  to 837,458, an increase of 52,724.

All  in  all,  improvements in monetary compensation, a  weak civilian  job  market,  a  national  commitment  to  improving  the overall  quality  of military life,  and a  growing national concern

about  the  Soviet  military  buildup  helped  produce another  en› couraging year in manning the All-Volunteer Army.

## Enlisted Personnel

In fiscal  year  1981, as  last year,  the Army met in full  its en› listed  recruiting goals  for  the active  Army,  the  Army  National Guard,  and  the  Army  Reserve,  obtaining  101.6  percent of its Total  Army  objective.  The  Army  Reserve  was  especially  suc› cessful,  recruiting  104.5 percent of its  total program objective. And, as last year, a  substantial increase in  the recruiting budget helped the Army reach its goals.

This overall success contributed to the Army's  achieving sev› eral other goals: a higher recruitment of  women and high school graduates and a  lower recruitment of  enlistees with Category IV (the lowest acceptable) scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). A strong influx of women into the Army Reserve helped  contribute  to  a  Total  Army  female  accession  of 106.1 percent of the fiscal  year objective. The active Army figure for Category IV recruits without prior service was  only  .9  percent over the 30-percent ceiling imposed by the Secretary of  the Army to  assist  the  Department  of  Defense  in  complying  with  the congressionally mandated all-service ceiling of 25 percent.  (Ac› tual Department of Defense Category IV accession for the fiscal year  was  18  percent.) The 30.9-percent accession  rate for  Cat› egory IV Army enlistees without prior service was a marked im› provement over the 52-percent rate in fiscal year 1980. But there is  still  room  for  improvement.  The median  test scores of Army recruits, unlike those in the other services, still fell  considerably below those of a  representative group of 12,000 young civilian men and women who took the AFQT in 1980. In the table below, comparative AFQT scores are given for categories I through V. (Columns may not add up to 100 percent due to rounding.)

The Army's primary recruiting goal for the fiscal year was to increase  the enlistments of high school  graduates, who  tend to

have more stable military careers than nongraduates. In recruit› ing  high  school  graduates  without  prior  service,  the  Army achieved a  Total Army accession  of 73.2  percent, well  beyond the congressional mandate of  65 percent and in excess of its own fiscal  year  objective  of 72.  2  percent.  The active  Army  was  es› pecially successful in this regard, with 80.3 percent of  its enlistees without prior service having earned a  high school  diploma,  up from 54.3 percent in fiscal year 1980. The Army's improvement was greater than that of any other service. The table below pre› sents the Total Army enlisted accessions for fiscal  year  1981.

A key incentive in the Army's  recruiting program is the offer of  cash bonuses. In November 1980 the Army raised the amount of its cash bonuses to enlistees in designated skill areas. The new maximum bonus of $5000 was offered to high school graduates in  categories 1-111 on the  AFQT who  enlisted  for  four  years' service in one of eleven designated combat arms military occu› pational specialties (MOSs) or  one designated military intelligence specialty. Maximum bonuses were also raised, but to lower levels, for  similar enlistees in  nine additional  MOSs;  three new  MOSs were added  to the  bonus eligibility  list  for  the first  time:  93E (meteorological observer), 98G (Spanish-American linguist), and 21G (Pershing electronic material  specialist).  Active  Army en› listment bonus payments totaled $56.8 million for the fiscal year and had a  marked effect on recruitment. Whereas in fiscal  year

1980 only 18 percent of  the new recruits who entered the critical MOSs were high school  graduates in  categories 1-111, in  fiscal year  1981  the figure was 41  percent.

Early in  the fiscal  year the Army also began to implement a long-range plan for recruiting and retaining qualified language specialists. In addition to the enlistment bonuses already in place, the plan provided for  recruiting procedures targeted at various ethnic population centers in the United States; monthly payments of $100  to $150 proficiency pay  to  language specialists,  partic› ularly  those  in  military  intelligence  assignments;  assignment of some linguists  to Korea on accompanied, rather than unaccom› panied,  tours  starting  in  fiscal  year  1981;  and  the  creation  of more  opportunities  for  intermediate  and  advanced  language training at the Defense Language Institute and at stateside and overseas colleges and universities.

Another enlistment incentive begun at the start of  fiscal year 1981  reduced the length of overseas tours for first-term soldiers on three-year enlistments. Soldiers leaving for Europe or Japan after 30 September 1980 received full  benefit of the reductions: six months for a  married soldier's unaccompanied tour, and an average of  twelve months for bachelors. Soldiers already overseas before the start of  the fiscal  year and not scheduled for stateside return during the fiscal  year received a pro-rata reduction. This incentive reduced the first-term unaccompahied tour to eighteen months and the bachelor tour also to eighteen months.

By  the  end of the  fiscal  year all  services  except  the  Army claimed to have  nearly  100 percent of the reservists,  including members of the National Guard, that they would need if a crisis forced full mobilization. The Army was still short about 179,000 reservists,  but was  gradually making up the difference as  more people either enlisted directly into the reserves or transferred in upon completion of  an active tour of duty. Recruiting still looms as a major problem in the decade ahead as the number of draft age men (seventeen to twenty-one years old) continues to decline. As  all  the services  try  to expand their enlisted manpower upon a dwindling population base, the Army faces a difficult challenge in recruiting the quality of  youths needed to operate increasingly complex weapons systems.

Although Congress terminated the Vietnam era G.I. Bill on 31  December  1976,  it did  provide  a  contributory  educational program  to  replace  the  bill, effective  1 January  1977.  In fiscal year 1981 the Army participated in the congressionally mandated Educational Assistance Test Program, during which  three edu› cational  benefit  programs  were  evaluated  as  possible  replace-

ments for the Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP). Initial congressional funding of  the three supplemental programs was designed to last  only through  fiscal  year  1981, and admin› istrative  delays  and  restrictions  on  publicity  of the  plans  ham› pered early evaluation of their success.

During the fiscal year, however, the Army did obtain evidence that  its  enhanced-VEAP  and  ultra-VEAP,  which  provides  sub› stantially greater benefits than similar Air Force and Navy pro› grams,  helped  the  Army  increase  quality  accessions  by approximately  10 percent without decreasing quality accessions in the other services.  A Rand Corporation study found that the authorized "equalizer" in  educational benefits substantially im› proved the Army's  ability to meet its recruiting goals. In the test cells,  where both Army and other service enlistees were offered equal education benefits, the Army enlisted 7 percent fewer qual› ity enlistees. The Rand study also suggested that the Army could attract more quality recruits to  the combat arms by requiring a soldier  to  enlist  in a  combat  MOS  in  order  to  qualify  for  the ultra-VEAP.  By  the  end  of the  fiscal  year  1981,  however,  the Army was preparing to expand the ultra-VEAP to all geographic areas in the nation while continuing to offer it to selected, highly technical noncombat as well as combat MOSs.

The  Army's targeted  recruiting  programs  have  produced some criticism in  recent years.  The Army has  learned that high school  graduates are  almost  twice  as  likely  as  nongraduates to complete their enlistments. Consequently, the attempt to recruit as  many  high  school  graduates  as  possible  has  produced  little criticism. The first-term attrition rates for fiscal years 1978-1981 are given in the following table (as percent of  accessions):

But  the  Army's attempt  to  turn  away  recruits  with  lower scores  on  the  Armed  Forces  Qualification  Test  (AFQT)  has proved more controversial. The Army staff contends that there is a strong correlation between high AFQT scores and later ef› fectiveness as a soldier, especially as measured on the Skill Qual› ification Test (SQT). Former Secretary of the Army Clifford L. Alexander, Jr.,  however,  considered the AFQT generally irrel› evant and  banned retention of soldiers' AFQT scores  in  their units' field  records.  In fiscal  year  1981  the  Department of De› fense submitted to Congress a study disputing this view.  Soldiers with  lower AFQT scores fared poorly in the SQT, dropped out of  the service in higher percentages than other recruits, and were promoted more slowly. In fiscal  year 1~81  the new Secretary of the Army, John 0. Marsh, Jr., overturned his predecessor's  view and  brought the Army's evaluation of preenlistment tests into alignment with that of the other services.  With strong congres› sional support, the Army will continue to recruit individuals who score  well  on  the  AFQT,  and  the  scores  will  be  used  to  assist commanders' decisions on assignments and promotion.

To improve its ability to measure a soldier's  qualifications and potential for developments,  the Army in fiscal  year  1981  over› hauled some of its testing procedures. In late l 980 the standard preenlistment test for all services, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), was discovered to have been seriously miscalibrated since 1976. When corrected, it showed that in fiscal year  1980  over  50  percent of nonprior-service  Army  enlistees were in mental Category IV, the lowest acceptable, instead of 10 percent as  originally  reported.  About  25  percent  of all  Army recruits accepted from January 1976 to October 1980 scored so low on the ASVAB that they would have been rejected had the test been properly calibrated. In October 1980 the Department of Defense introduced a  new,  properly calibrated test.

In the summer of 1981, because of  poor test construction and equipment differences, the Army ordered a halt to the SQT for certain  soldiers  in  three  MOSs.  Commanders  were  advised  to adjust  the  promotion  scores  of soldiers  who  may  have  been harmed by the faulty tests. By the end of  the fiscal year the Army faced  congressional  criticism  that the  SQT by  itself could  not reliably  measure  a  soldier's effectiveness  nor serve  as  a  major guide in making assignments and promotions.

Congressional interest, particularly that of  the House Appro› priations  Committee,  has  also  focused  on  the  budget  and  or› ganization of the U.S.  Army Recruiting Command (USAREC). On 27  October  1980  the  Army approved  the  USAREC Reor-

ganization Study of 1980 and directed recruiting regions to re› align  themselves  in  accordance with  the study,  thus saving  156 personnel  spaces  (out  of approximately  5,000).  USAREC  also proceeded to  realign  the  district recruiting  commands  for  ad› ditional savings. The Niagara Falls District Recruiting Command headquarters was closed on 30 September 1981, saving 19 spaces in addition  to  the  156 spaces saved  through realignment of the recruiting  regions.  USAREC  was  authorized  to  use  all  saved spaces to meet recruiting requirements necessary to increase en› listments of both high school graduates and the number of en› listees with scores in the higher test categories.

Toward the end of the fiscal  year the Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, was seeking authorization to nearly double the special duty performance pay (SDPP) of Army recruiters as well as per› mission  to  merge  reenlistment and recruiter MOSs,  thus quali› fying reenlisting  NCOs for the same SDPP as recruiters.

In  fiscal  year  1981  the Army  did preliminary  work for  im› plementing a  "pro-pay" plan as a supplementary cash incentive for enlisted soldiers. Congressional leaders have recently pointed out that a sizable  minority of first-term  Army recruits take ad› vantage of the opportunity to change their MOS, even after re› ceiving a  cash bonus for enlisting in a shortage MOS.  Congress has also noted that most of  this movement is away from the com› bat arms specialties. The Army made plans to counter this tend› ency in fiscal  year 1982 by rewarding current holders of  shortage

MOSs with a supplementary monthly cash payment. The original plan was  to grant up to $150  monthly  to 22,000  NCOs in  the combat arms and to  11,000 soldiers  in  precision  maintenance, intelligence, and automated data processing MOSs.  But toward the end of fiscal  year 1981  the Army decided that unavoidable budgetary constraints for  fiscal  year  1982  made  it necessary  to use all bonus funds to increase recruitment reenlistment bonuses. The pro-pay plan had to be postponed indefinitely.

Even  without  pro-pay  the  Army  managed  to  reduce  MOS migration in  fiscal  year  1981.  In fiscal  year  1980,  34.  5  percent of  first-term combat arms soldiers went to noncombat arms skills; in fiscal year 1981, this figure fell to 26.  2 percent. And movement from noncombat and noncritical skills to combat arms and other shortage skills  increased-from  12.2  percent of first-term  sol› diers in  fiscal  year 1980 to  13.  8  percent in fiscal  year 1981. The Army achieved this increase by improving the possibility of  pro› motion  in  critical  MOSs and offering selective reenlistment bo› nuses similar to recruitment bonuses.

The task of recruiting high-quality first-term  personnel  be› comes much easier when the Army is able to persuade many of its skilled soldiers to reenlist. Fewer recruits are needed, and the Army quickly  gains a  reputation  for  professionalism  and  lead› ership in  its  noncommissioned officers.  As  the Army adopts in› creasingly  complex  weapons  systems,  its  effectivness  depends more and more on highly competent NCOs. Retention is quickly becoming as vital an  issue to the Army as recruitment.

In  his  fiscal  year  1982  posture  statement  to  Congress,  the Chief of Staff stated  that  his  most  serious  near-term  manning problem was retaining midlevel NCOs. He asked that future in› creases in military compensation  focus  on pay raises,  expanded bonuses, specialty duty pay, and responsibility pay for NCOs. The Army  has  been  trying  to  increase  the  number  of NCOs  since fiscal year 1979, when the top five grades of  NCOs made up 3  7  .8 percent of the enlisted strength.  In fiscal  year  1980 this figure increased to  38 percent, and in fiscal  year  1981  to  39 percent. Despite the improvement, serious shortages remained in the com› bat arms,  where  E-5  to  E-9 strength  was  nearly  8,000  below objective near the  end of fiscal  year  1981.  Voluntary reclassifi› cations out of these combat skills among E-5 to E-9 reenlistees were many:  30 percent of infantrymen,  28 percent of artillery› men, and 26 percent of armor soldiers.

As  a  measure  of the  Army's problem  with  NCOs,  in  fiscal year  1980  the  Army was  authorized  264,800  personnel  in  the top five  enlisted grades,  but achieved an  end strength  of only

256,100.  In fiscal  year  1981  the  Army  reduced  the  shortage, achieving  an  end  strength  of  263,500  out  of an  authorized 266,100. To highlight this problem, in fiscal year 1981  the Army changed its two-level classification for enlisted men (first-termers and career) to a three-level classification (first-term, midterm, and career). The new midterm category covered all soldiers on their second or subsequent enlistment  up  to ten  years  of service.  In fiscal  year 1981  the Army fell  considerably short of  its midterm objective, obtaining 24,613 reenlistments out of  a goal of  28,007, or 88  percent of the  objective.  Career-level  reenlistments also fell short, 3.8 percent below the goal of 19,817. Only first-term reenlistments were a  notable  success:  34,601  reenlistments,  or 118 percent of the goal. The total active Army result was about the same as last year, approximately l O 1 percent of  the objective.

During the  fiscal  year,  the Army considered further expan› sion of its  reenlistment objective system.  Thought was  given to setting up an Army goal for reenlistments occurring outside the standard eligibility window-six months to estimated time of  sep› aration (ETS) for first-termers and three months to ETS for ca› reerists-and  to  setting  up  a  goal  for  reenlistment  in  critical specialties. None of  these goals were feasible without further de› velopment of the Army's data systems  and auditing capability. Development of these areas did begin during the fiscal year.

Based on  its  highly  successful  CONUS-to-CONUS  reenlist› ment option  for  first-term  soldiers,  the Army on  1  November 1980 began a pilot program that permits careerists of rank E-6 and  below to  reenlist for  selected CONUS installations  with a promise  that  they  will  not  be  transferred  for  at  least  twelve months. This should help to improve retention of the midgrade careerist.

The Armv's main  incentive  to  reenlist  is  the  Selective  Re› enlistment Bonus (SRB) Program, which gives bonuses to soldiers who reenlist in  designated  MOSs.  In fiscal  year  1981  Congress gave to the Army the authority to increase the maximum bonus from $12,000 to $16,000. Starting in fiscal  year 1981  the Army expanded  the  program  to  include  reenlistees  who have  ten  to fourteen years of service (Zone C).  This allowed about 400 lin› guists  and other technicians to reenlist and receive a  bonus in fiscal year 1981. Previously, only soldiers with twenty-one months to ten years of  service (Zone B) were eligible for the reenlistment bonus.  In  October  1980  over  60  MOSs,  mostly  combat arms, were added to the Zone B program. In February 1981, 28 MOSs, again mostly combat arms,  were either added to the SRB Pro› gram or authorized higher SRB payments.

Perhaps the most important change in the SRB Program this year involved Congress' extension of the  maximum number of years of service  for  bonus computation from  twelve  to sixteen years. A soldier in Zone B with almost ten years of  service could now reenlist for up to six years and receive a bonus based on the total additional obligation.  Under the old twelve-year system, a soldier with  nine  years  of service  who  reenlisted  for  six  years could receive bonus credit for a maximum of three years of ad› ditional obligation.  But even  this innovation did not enable the Army to meet its fiscal  year retention goal for NCOs.

Overall,  however,  the  Army's retention  efforts  succeeded, with  reenlistments  rising  from  62  percent of eligibles  in  fiscal year 1980 to 67  percent in  fiscal  year  1981.  Increased pay  and bonuses contributed greatly to the rise, but the Army refused to take it as  a  guarantee of similar success in  the near future.

Several studies have noted a correlation between strong unit cohesion and soldier loyalty and effectiveness,  both on and off the battlefield. In an attempt to reduce the high personnel turn› over rate associated with the current individual replacement sys› tem, the Army in fiscal  year 1981 began to test twenty Cohesion Operational  Readiness  and  Training  (COHORT)  companies. The members of each of these companies would complete basic and  advanced  individual  training  together  and  serve  fifteen months  in  the  continental  United  States  followed  by  eighteen months overseas.  Each company would have the same noncom› missioned and commissioned leaders for the three years. The first COHORT unit was  formed in  late March  I  981  at Fort Knox, Kentucky; toward the end of the fiscal  year the first COHORT company completed advanced individual training at Fort Carson, Colorado.

At the same time, the Army began to plan a  more compre› hensive move toward fostering unit cohesion. In fiscal year 1980 the Chief of Staff had directed the commander of the Training and Doctrine Command to develop a plan to convert the Army to a regimental system, similar to that of  the British and Canadian armies. In April 1981, the Manning Task Force began to function within  ODCSPER as  the Army staff's focal  point for planning the change.

The basic goal of the reform is  to have soldiers spend more time  in  a  single  unit  than  the  current  individual  replacement system allows.  During fiscal  year  1981  the Manning Task Force identified about 200 battalions that could be subordinated to a reduced list of  four- to six-battalion regiments of  the active Army. Initial studies suggested that the new system would not be directly

applicable to  the  National  Guard or to the  Army Reserve.  Re› placements in the new system would take place either by rotating an individual from battalion to battalion within  his regiment or by rotating the battalions among the regiment's various assigned duty posts.  One option  considered  was  to  allow  the  individual regiments  to  recruit directly  into  their  own  unit and then  su› pervise the basic training of  their recruits. Each regiment would be assigned a  home post in  the United States and one or more overseas duty stations,  the battalions would  take turns rotating between the home post and overseas assignments,  and most of the regiment's recruits would be drawn from the region around the home base. This concept, or a  variation of it,  seemed likely to improve unit esprit de corps and to serve as a  vital  nonmon› etary stimulus for reenlistments and highly motivated service. Full implementation of the new manning system will probably extend through the 1980s.

Until  the new  unit rotation system  becomes completely op› erational, the Army will continue to focus on Space Imbalanced Military Occupational Specialties (SIMOS) to reduce the turbu› lence associated with  overseas tours.  An  MOS  with  55  percent or more of its spaces assigned abroad qualifies as a  SIM  OS. Sol› diers in these specialties have  much  shorter CONUS tours  be› tween overseas assignments than average and tend to  leave  the Army at a  much higher rate than other soldiers. About 30,000 soldiers in  thirty-seven skills,  mainly related to missile,  nuclear, and electronic warfare operations and maintenance fields,  cur› rently are SIMOS. To assist in coping with the SIMOS retention problem, Congress in  December 1980 enacted Public Law 96579, which authorizes the Army to offer either $50 a  month or a  period of rest or recuperative absence to soldiers who extend their overseas tours for at least one year. The incentive seems to be working. Tour extensions for SIM  OS personnel tripled during the first  six  months of 1981  compared with a  similar period in 1979 (from 323 to 1,008).

The Army's increased recruitment and retention of enlisted personnel  in fiscal  year  1981  had  a  discernible  influence on a growing national debate on the future of the all-volunteer force. The Army staff, anticipating a  50-percent decline  in  voluntary enlistments  by  fiscal  year  1985,  proposed a  five-year  program calling for reinstitution of the draft by the fall  of 1984 to  meet its goal of  expanding the active force by about 100,000 over the next five years. But the Secretary of  the Army rejected this pro› posal,  arguing that  the  Army  can  meet  its  manpower  require› ments,  at  least  through  1987,  without  reviving  conscription.

Expanded recruiting and retention incentives, such as greater pay and benefits, and the increased use of  civilians in noncom  bat  jobs were  expected  to  offset  most of the decline  in  the  size  of the youth population eligible  for  military service.  Furthermore,  by the end of the fiscal  year, looming budgetary constraints seemed likely  to  cause  the  proposed  large  increases  in  active  Army strength to be shelved at least  temporarily.

The active Army finished fiscal year 1981 with the following enlisted grade structure:

| Grade                               | Strength   |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| E-9 . . .                           | 3,744      |

## Officers

In fiscal year 1981 the Army's  officer program, like its enlisted program,  achieved  notable  successes.  Although  the  Army  fell short of its  accession  goal  by  522  officers,  the end strength  of the  officer  corps  rose  by  3,259  to  a  total  of 101,477.  Officer retention, especially of  lieutenants and captains, was outstanding.

In accordance with the  fiscal  year  198  I  Department of De› fense  Authorization  Bill,  the  number of general  officers  in  all services declined by 4  percent (in  the Army, from  432  to 415). The following table breaks down the actual officer end strength by grade as of 30 September 1981:

As  in  previous  years,  the  Reserve  Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) furnished  the  largest single  group of new active  duty officers: 3,981 out ofa total ROTC production of 6,174 officers. Average enrollment in college-level  ROTC programs increased 2.7 percent over the previous fiscal year, from 63,326 to 69,663. The nation's changing attitude toward military service accounts for some growth, but successful  managment also played a  role. The Army continued to increase the number of ROTC units at the nation's  colleges, universities, and high schools, and it further developed the ROTC-Selected Reserve Simultaneous Member› ship Program (SMP). The Army also awarded the first 1,035 of the  5,500  new  ROTC scholarships authorized  by  Congress  in September 1980.

The Expand the  Base  program,  begun in  fiscal  year  1980, calls for  the phased opening of extension centers, consisting of three officer instructors and one NCO, at colleges and univers› ities that have not previously offered ROTC. The most successful centers will then be elevated to full detachment (host) status (five officers, four NCOs, and one civilian). In fiscal  year 1980 forty› one extension  centers  were opened,  and about  2,500 students (about 1,000 more than the Army expected) enrolled.  In fiscal year  1981  forty-eight  new  centers  were opened, and eight old centers were elevated to host status. By fiscal  year 1983 the pro-

gram  is  scheduled  to  have  elevated  twenty-eight  more  centers, creating a  total of 315  host detachments.  An important feature of  the expansion program is the assignment of  an Army Reserve or Army National Guard officer to each of  the host detachments, so  that most of the  4,000 additional officers expected to be pro› duced each year by  the expansion and other initiatives  can  be channeled into units of  the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. In fiscal year 1981  fifty Army Reserve officers and fifty› one Army  National  Guard officers were assigned  to host insti› tutions.

The Army ROTC-Selected Reserve Simultaneous Member› ship Program (SMP) continued to be highly successful  in  fiscal year  1981.  Subject  to  certain  limitations,  SMP permits eligible enlisted personnel assigned to a troop program unit of the Army National  Guard or  the  Army  Reserve  to  enter  the  Advanced Course  (Military  Science  III  and  IV)  of the  ROTC academic program, and allows  eligible ROTC Advance  Course cadets  to enlist in and serve as officer trainees with guard or reserve units. Participants in  the program drill  with  their National Guard or Army Reserve units as officer trainees at the rank of cadet and are paid in the grade and years of service attained (but not less than the grade of E-5). Participants also receive ROTC training as well  as  a  subsistence allowance  of $100 per month for  up to twenty  months.  On completing the ROTC program, SMP par› ticipants are commissioned and assigned to either an Army Re› serve or National Guard unit, pending graduation from coJlege. Upon graduation, these officers are assigned active duty, reserve forces duty, or educational delay, depending on the needs of the Army.

By the end of fiscal year 1980, the SMP program could boast of more than 2,000 participants. In fiscal year 1981  this number grew to more than 5,000, even while enrollment in the ROTC Advanced Course grew only 1.6 percent, based on opening year enrollment. Although most participants were already enrolled in ROTC when recruited into the SMP program, future emphasis will be placed on recruiting enlisted reserve component members who have had no ROTC training.

Improvements in officer retention paralleled those in officer accession.  Officer  retention  in  fiscal  year  1981  continued  the favorable  trend  of the  previous  five  years.  There  were  fewer losses among all  types of officers than in  the past fiscal  year.  In 1981, 2,248 officers resigned or were released from active duty, compared to 2,903 in  1980. Voluntary retirements also showed a drop, down to  1,983 after a  four-year  high of 2,637  in  1980.

Company grade losses were 3,793, compared with 4,226 in 1980. Despite these improvements,  the Army still experienced officer shortages in some engineering, scientific, and technical specialties and in the warrant officer aviation skills. In fiscal year 1981, 1,100 authorized officer jobs went unfilled.  Congress  has  authorized continuation  pay  to improve the retention  of scientists and en› gineers.

One long-standing problem area in the officer force,  the re› cruitment and retention of medical personnel, showed some im› provement  in  fiscal  year  1981,  despite  continuing  shortfalls. Recruitment and retention efforts  resulted in  an even  greater increase  in  the  number of year-end active duty  Medical  Corps officers (from 4,627 to 4,909), but critical shortages still existed in several specialties, such as orthopedic surgery. The number of officers in the Medical Corps and Nurse Corps still  fell  far short of minimum peacetime requirements.

Passage of  the Uniformed Services Health Professions Special Pay Act of 1980 has had a generally positive effect on retention. Many physicians no longer feel that military pay and benefits are a drawback to military service. But civilian pay is still considerably higher in  some surgical specialties.  As  a  result of increased  pay and other management initiatives,  the  retention  rate  for  first› term physicians (other than volunteers) now exceeds 30 percent and may rise to and stabilize around 33 percent in the near future. Volunteer physicians tend to have a  much higher retention rate, approaching 70 percent. Since half of the present Medical Corps strength has entered active duty since 1978, it is  unclear whether these retention rates will continue over a period of  years. If  they continue, however, the Army should have less trouble maintain› ing the strength of the Medical Corps.

To  provide  the  armed  forces  with  an  officer  management policy that is  uniform, equitable, and tailored to contemporary manpower requirements,  the Department of Defense and Con› gress  in  fiscal  year  1981  finally  agreed,  after  sixteen  years  of effort, on  the  Defense  Officer  Personnel  Management  Act (DOPMA). Congress passed it on 21  November 1980, the Pres› ident signed  it on  12  December, and it went  into effect on  15 September 1981. Although DOPMA affects all commissioned of› ficers,  including generals, its primary effects will  be, first, to cre› ate a single promotion system for all field grade officers on active duty and, second, to create eventually an active Army field grade officer corps that is all Regular Army. The new system will replace the old dual system of permanent Regular Army (RA) ranks and temporary Army of the United States (AUS) ranks as well as an

active Army field grade officer corps that since the Vietnam War has  consisted  of about  7  percent Other  Than  Regular  Army (OTRA) officers.

On the  new  active  duty  list,  officers  will  be  grouped  into competitive categories for  promotion.  These categories  will  be formally  established in  early  fiscal  year  1982,  but they are ex› pected to  be the same as they were before DOPMA. They are as  follows:  (1)  Army,  which  includes  officers  in  specialties  00 through  54 and 69 through 97; (2) Judge Advocate  General's Corps; (3) Chaplain Corps; (4) Medical Corps; (5) Dental Corps; (6) Army Nurse Corps; (7) Medical Service Corps; (8) Army Med› ical  Specialist Corps, combined with  Medical Corps for general officer promotion; and (9) Veterinary Corps.

Under the old officer  management system,  OTRA officers held temporary AUS ranks for active duty purposes and generally were separated or reduced  in  rank before RA officers.  RA of› ficers on active duty held both their permanent RA rank and an AUS rank, which  usually rose before the RA rank. Active duty RA officers competed on the same  list  with active duty OTRA officers for AUS ranks, and had to achieve promotions that kept their  RA  rank  within  range  of their  AUS  rank,  or face  invol› untary separation.  Both RA and OTRA officers on active duty could retire at their AUS rank even if it were higher than their RA or reserve rank. While retired RA officers who later worked as  federal  civilian  employees  had to accept a  reduction in  their military retirement pay,  reserve officers and regular officers re› tired  for combat disability  who  later worked as  civilian  federal employees could draw both their full  military pension and their full  civilian employee salary, subject to an overall limit equal to the current compensation of civilian Executive Level V employ› ees ($57,500 in fiscal  year 1981). DOPMA leaves intact the main retirement provisions of  the Dual Compensation Act and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, but it requires far-reaching changes in the active duty treatment of regular and OTRA officers.

Under DOPMA provisions,  the  Army will  replace  the  dual system in  the active  Army field grades with a  single active duty list, which will eventually consist of  an all-regular force. As of 15 September 1981, the effective date of DOPMA, the temporary (AUS) rank of  field-grade active Army officers became their per› manent  rank,  eliminating  the  temporary  quality  of the  AUS ranks.  In addition, a  number of  active Army OTRA field  grade officers on  active  duty  before  l  October  1981  were scheduled to be offered integration into the Regular Army.  Active Army

OTRA lieutenants and captains who start active duty after  15 September 1981  will,  if promoted to  major,  have  to  accept in› tegration into the Regular Army or else leave active duty within ninety days.  Those active Army OTRA lieutenants and captains who started active duty before 15 September 1981  may,  if pro› moted to major after 30 September  1981, decline the Regular Army integration and continue on active duty to maximum ten› ure, subject to the needs of the Army and on the condition that they maintain a standard schedule of promotions.

These active  Army  OTRA officers,  however,  have  several incentives  to  convert to  the  Regular  Army.  First,  they  will  be eligible for up to thirty years' tenure in the Regular Army if they can advance to colonel, whereas the usual active duty tenure for OTRA officers is  only  twenty  years.  Second,  they can take ad› vantage of DOPMA's modification  of the  traditional  up-or-out system in the Regular Army. Under the new system, RA captains who are twice  passed  up  for  promotion  may  be selectively con› tinued to a  maximum  of twenty years' service; majors who are twice not selected for promotion may be continued to a maximum of  twenty-four years' service.  OTRA captains and majors in this predicament will  probably obtain  less  liberal terms  for selective continuation, such as those offered in the Selective Continuation Program, newly implemented in fiscal year 1980. This program permitted certain nonselected  officers to continue in  active ser› vice  for  three  years  or  until  they  are  eligible  for  retirement, whichever comes first.  As a third incentive, during reductions in force, regular officers will be separated only after OTRA officers in  their competitive area.

The eventual  effect of these  DOPMA-induced changes will be  to create an  all-regular officers corps  in  the  field  grades  of the active Army, once all active  Army OTRA officers who have declined the Regular Army conversion have retired.

DOPMA also contains other provisions that will  have a  sig› nificant effect on Army personnel  policy.  Under the  DOPMA realignment of the ranks of field  grade officers,  the  Army has until the end of  fiscal  year 1983 to reduce the number of majors and lieutenant colonels. DOPMA authorizes the decentralization to the field of promotions to captain, but in fiscal year 1981 the Army decided to postpone its plans to implement this provision. DOPMA mandates minimum time-in-grade standards for due› course officer promotions:

| To First Lieutenant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 18 months   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| To Captain. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . • . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 2 years     |
| To Major . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 3 years     |
| To Lieutenant Colonel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | 3 years     |
| To Colonel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . • . . . . . . . . . | 3 years     |

DOPMA also  provides  that an officer retire  in  the  highest grade in  which he served on active duty for six or more months; except that to retire voluntarily in a  grade above major, the of› ficer must have served on active duty at least three years in  that grade. Prior law did not require any minimum period of service for an officer to retire voluntarily in  his  permanent grade;  but for  retirement in a  temporary grade  that was  higher than  the officer's  permanent grade, Army policy required six months' sat› isfactory service in the higher grade. DOPMA doubles the max› imum pay for involuntary separation, from $15,000 to $30,000. It also  establishes  uniform  constructive  credit rules  for  all  the services that will improve Army accession of highly educated and technically trained officers, especially in the Medical Department and Judge Advocate General Corps. To allow  for the mandated conversion of active  Army officers with  reserve commissions to the  Regular Army,  DOPMA  increases  the authorized strength of the Regular Army officer corps from 49,500 to 63,000.

The transition  to  an  all-Regular  Army  field  grade  officer corps in the active  Army may  take a  decade or more. DOPMA is  the  most complete revision  of officer personnel management since the Officer Personnel Act of 194  7.

In fiscal year 1981 the Department of Defense, with DOPMA now enacted, began work on companion legislation for the man› agement of  reserve officers. The Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics) began to draft the Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA). The department organized a steering committee of general and flag  officers  representing all  reserve components to resolve  in› terservice differences and review the basic areas of  proposed leg› islation. After  two  meetings  in  fiscal year  1981,  the  steering committee recommended that the  proposed legislation  address the problem of recruiting professionals into the reserves.  Since DOPMA has constrained the services  in  appointing officers in grades above second lieutenant, the reserve components antici› pate even  more problems in recruiting civilian professionals and appointing them in the higher grades. It appears that the reserve components will  request  considerable  leeway  in  granting  con-

structive service credit to new reserve appointees, particularly to nonmedical  and  nondental  professionals  whose  civilian  experi› ence warrants an appointment in a grade higher than major.

In  its  continuing  effort  to  improve  the  professional  devel› opment of  commissioned officers, the Army made  several changes in its Officer Personnel Management System in fiscal year 1981. It created Specialty Code (SC) 70,  Intelligence Management, to identify multifunctional, senior (normally 06, but in  no instance below  05)  managerial positions in  intelligence,  primarily at the national  or major command  level.  It fused  SC  76,  Armament Materiel Management, and SC 77, Tank-Ground Materiel Man› agement to form SC 91, Maintenance Management. Also merged were SC 87, Marine and Terminal Operations, and SC 88, High› way  and Rail  Operations,  to form  SC 95, Transportation Man› agement.  SC  52,  Atomic  Energy,  was  redesignated  Nuclear Weapons.

During fiscal year 1981 staff  elements of  the Office of  Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the Military Personnel Center, and the special branches continued to develop the Officer Force Man› agement Plan, concentrating on synthesizing DOPMA con› straints  with  projected  force  structure  requirements  for  the 1980s. In a related development, the Office of the Assistant Sec› retary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs took the lead in planning for a fiscal year 1983 implementation of FORE› CAST, an automated information system designed to provide the Army  with  a  comprehensive  officer  management and analysis tool.  During  fiscal year  1981  a  FORECAST  Technical Work Group, consisting of  representatives from the Military Personnel Center, the Training and Doctrine Command, and the offices of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Personnel and  the Assistant Sec› retary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, selected the contractors to write the functional description of  the system, helped them  in  their work,  and prepared for the system devel› opment to be completed in  fiscal  year  1982.  FORECAST will serve as a  comprehensive tool, oriented toward the Army Plan› ning,  Programming, and Budgeting System, for projecting re› quirements  in  officer  training,  procurement,  promotion, retention, skill development, and distribution.

## Women in the Army

In  fiscal  year  1981  the sustained growth over the  last  nine years in the number and influence of  women in the Army slowed

perceptibly,  as  both  the  Department of the  Army  and  the Su› preme Court involved themselves in a review of this process.

In June 1981  the Supreme Court ruled in Rostker v. Goldberg that Congress  acted constitutionally  in  excluding women  from the draft registration program that Congress had enacted in fiscal year 1980 as  part of the U.S.  response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Opponents of the draft had questioned the consti› tutionality of  an all-male draft registration. The six-to-three ma› jority opinion in the Supreme Court rested on the argument that Congress had intended to provide for a draft of Americans suit› able  for  fighting as  combat troops and that women, because of congressional and military restraints of  the use of  women in com› bat, are not suitable for purposes of  a draft or registration for a draft. The Supreme Court refused to fault Congress'  conclusions that volunteers will  meet the need for any extra women in non› combat roles during a mobilization and that staffing noncombat positions with women during a mobilization "would be positively detrimental  to  the  important goal  of military  flexibility."  The Court concluded that Congress gave thorough consideration  to the issue before excluding women from the draft registration and t hat the decision "was not the accidental by-product of a  tradi› tional way  of thinking about women."

In a related action the Department of the Army in  February 1981  decided  to  reduce  its  projected end strength for  women soldiers, an action  which brought to a  virtual  halt by June 1981 the  recruitment  of women  for  the  fiscal  year.  It was  resumed briefly  at  the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  but  only  for  high  school graduates. T he department had decided to review and evaluate a number of reports from field commanders who were question› ing the effect of women soldiers on the readiness of their units.

Some field commanders have indicated that combat readiness is  being  affected  by  a  high  rate  of female  dropouts  from  the Army,  especially  during the  first  term;  by  the  high number of pregnancies; and by low female stamina and upper body strength. Nearly 50 percent more first-term female soldiers fail to complete their enlistment than first-term male soldiers. From 8  to 10 per› cent of  female enlisted soldiers are pregnant at any one time, and probably three-fourths of  these would have to be evacuated along with  dependents from  potential  war  zones,  such  as  Europe,  in event of  a mobilization. Furthermore, some women soldiers have trouble adjusting to certain military occupational specialties, such as heavy  maintenance,  that  require  exceptional  upper  body strength.  In  February  1981  the Army decided  to  pause  at an active Army end strength of 65,000 women enlisted personnel,

to allow time for a more thorough study of these alleged prob› lems.

In April 1981, under orders from the Chief  of  Staff, the Army formed a  Policy  Review  Group on Women in the Army, under the  direction  of a  general  officer.  The active  Army consists  of approximately 9 percent women, while the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve  troop  units are about 5  percent and  15 percent female, respectively. The decision to stabilize the female end strength, pending a review of  the effect of  the female soldier on Army readiness and combat effectiveness,  did  not  limit the recruiting of  females into the Army National Guard or the Army Reserve; but any policy revisions resulting from the final  report of the Policy  Review  Group will  affect these components.  The director of the  Policy  Review  Group was  scheduled  to present his initial findings to the Chief of  Staff by the end of December 1981.

In a number of  related actions, the Army staff  and field agen› cies  began  to  focus  on  the status of women  in  the Army.  The Army Research Institute initiated a major study of  women in the Army, to determine the causes of the differences in male versus female attrition in the Army's  approximately 350 enlisted MOSs and to suggest ways  to reduce these differences. The study was scheduled for completion during the second quarter of  fiscal year 1982. The Army Audit Agency also conducted a similar survey and audit,  whose  results  will  be compared  with  the findings  of the Army Research Institute. A final report should be completed by the end of the second quarter of  fiscal year 1982. At the same time,  the Training and Doctrine  Command  began  to establish physical  strength standards  for  each  of the  MOSs  in  order to allow  the screening out of personnel  who  lack  the physical  re› quirements of a particular MOS.

One goal of  these studies will be to determine the reasons for the unusually high number of females leaving the nontraditional MOSs.  The Army in  the past  few  years  has  opened about 94 percent of its MOSs to females, administratively excluding them only from MOSs likely to involve direct combat: namely, MOSs organic  to  battalion-sized and smaller units of infantry,  armor, cannon field artillery, combat engineers, and low-altitude air de› fense.  In fiscal  year 1981 only 40 percent of  the Army's enlisted women served in traditionally female skills-medical and admin› istrative.  Less  traditional  skills  accounted  for  25  percent;  and nontraditional  skills  took  up  the  remaining  35  percent,  down from  39 percent in fiscal  year  1980.

But in  fiscal  year  1981  this  broadened  approach  to  female

participation in Army work drew criticism from within the Army and prompted a suggestion that women be allowed to enlist freely in  traditionally  female  MOSs.  Several  critics  have  pointed  out that  many  MOSs  open  to  women,  such as  transportation,  will inevitably  require them to work close  behind the forward edge of  the battle area and that they will at times be  subjected to intense enemy fire.  The critics  have  expressed  doubts  that  women  in general will  be able to function as effectively as  men in such an environment. The Army is  fully  aware of this skepticism, how› ever, and has been giving men and women identical initial entry training and advanced skill  training, including weapons qualifi› cations.

With increasing evidence that sexual harassment contributes significantly  to  the high rate  of female  first-term  attrition, the Secretary of the Army in May  1981  signed a  memorandum for all  personnel  emphasizing the  unacceptability of sexual harass› ment and its  incompatibility with  "the highest professional be› havior  and  courtesy."  The  memorandum  defined  sexual harassment as

- (1) influencing, offering to influence, or threatening the career, pay, or  job of another person-woman or man-in exchange for sexual favors; or (2) delib› erate or repeated offensive comments, gestures or physical contact of  a sexual nature in a work or duty-related environment.

The memorandum urged individuals subjected to sexual harass› ment to make it clear to the off nding person that such behavior e is  offensive and to report the harassment to the appropriate su› pervisory level.  During fiscal  year  1981  the Army staff initiated a  survey  through the Soldier Support Center at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana,  to determine more precisely the extent and effects of sexual harassment in the Army.

In spite of the ongoing review concerning the proper role of women in  the Army,  the end strength of enlisted  women  rose from  61,351  in  fiscal  year  1980  to  64,884  in  fiscal  year  1981, and of officers from 7,615 in fiscal year  1980 to 8,385 in  fiscal year 1981.  In addition, there were 19,621  women in the Army National Guard and 49,618 in the Army Reserve (both Individual Ready  Reserve  and Selected  Reserve).  The decision  to reduce the projected end strength in  enlisted women,  however,  meant that the active  Army fell  far short of its  original goal  for fiscal year  1981  of 24,500  female  enlistees  without prior service,  re› cruiting only 18,302.

## Military Manpower and Personnel Management

Since October 1973 the Army has employed a system called ELIM-COMPLIP (Enlisted Loss Inventory Model-Computation of Manpower Programs Using Linear Programming) to reflect the current enlisted manpower status of the active Army and to project enlisted manpower variables seven years into the future. The results are used in budgeting, planning the use of the train› ing base, and setting recruiting objectives.  Each year the Army refines ELIM-COMPLIP to improve enlisted loss projections and enlisted  force  management.  Although  a  highly  successful  tool, ELIM-COMPLIP cannot discriminate by grade or military oc› cupational specialty.

Furthermore, the system models only the enlisted force.  Of› ficer projections are done externally and entered into the ELIM› COMPLIP system, so that they are available for the various re› ports that the system produces. A five-year project is  under way to develop a  more comprehensive system called FORECAST› a  modular,  automated  data  processing system  that will  project active  Army military strength (officer and enlisted)  both in ag› gregate terms and by grade,  skill,  and  unit.  The system  is  de› signed to improve planning, programming, and budgeting and to  enable  the  Army  to  better project the effects  of alternative policies  on  its  manpower.  The  system  will  function  in  modes adapted to times of peace, partial mobilization, and full  mobili› zation.

By the end of fiscal  year 1981  the Army staff had completed and tested a  prototype of the Enlisted MOS Level Subsystem of FORECAST. The production version of the subsystem is sched› uled to be completed in fiscal  year  1982. This new module will be put into operation in fiscal year 1984 and will provide detailed skill  and grade information. Also  in  fiscal  year  1981, contracts were let to develop the Enlisted Mobilization Subsystem, the Unit Level Subsystem, and Officer Subsystem, all of which should be ready between fiscal year 1984 and fiscal year 1987. When com› bined with the existing capabilities of FORECAST, these subsys› tems  should  enable  the  active  Army  to  project  and  plan  for enlisted and officer strengths both in peacetime and during mo› bilization.

Development of the Manpower Evaluation and Tracking Sys› tem (METS) continued in fiscal year 1981. METS, a three-phase program  for  monitoring  manpower  resources,  compares  data from the Army's manpower, personnel, and financial accounting systems.\_  METS  will  allow  the  Army  to ensure  that  manpower

and related  dollars are  being  used  for  the  purposes  for  which they were justified and authorized.  During Phase I,  completed in fiscal  year 1980, the basic system structure was established to demonstrate both the feasibility and capabilities of the project. After Phase II, scheduled  for completion by mid-fiscal year 1983, METS will  provide data to  manage the manpower and related resources  of all  the  Army's manned  units.  During  Phase  III, METS will be expanded to provide automated, remote access to the system by major commands and interested agencies.

Design of an upgraded manpower programming system for the Army Reserve was finished in fiscal  year 1979. This system, known as ARMPRO, provides manpower planning, budgeting, and programming information for Army Reserve troop program units similar to that supplied by ELIM-COMPLIP for the active Army.  During fiscal  year  1980  modifications  in  ARMPRO  re› sulted in a more responsive program that reflects current Army Reserve policy.  During fiscal  year  1981  the  test and validation phase of the development of ARMPRO was completed. The sys› tem will  become fully  operational in early fiscal  year  1982.

In addition to these improvements in military manpower man› agement,  the  Army  continued  to  experiment  with  new  ap› proaches to civilian manpower management. In August 1979 the Chief of Staff authorized  the  testing  of a  revised  method  for determining Army manpower requirements. In contrast to the usual  technique of reviewing  many functions  at a  single instal› lation,  this  new  test,  called  Functional  Army  Manpower Evalu› ation (FAME),  studied a  single function  (civilian  personnel administration) at twenty-five representative locations. The test identified  relationships  between  man-hours  expended  and  the final product. From this data the Army staff  developed man-hour equations that  predict staffing requirements for civilian personnel administration throughout the Army.

On 24 July 1981  the Director of Manpower, Programs, and Budget approved the standards for civilian personnel operations that came from FAME and provided guidance to the major com› mands for application and implementation of the standards. The major commands are scheduled to implement the standards and formalize the resulting manpower requirements in tables of dis› tribution and allowances  before the end of fiscal  year  198  2.  As a  result of the successful  FAME test, the Army has begun work on an  expanded  version  of the  test  program-the Manpower Staffing Standards System,  which  will  include the development of  a functional dictionary to provide a language for and interface with The Army Authorization Document System (T  AADS) and

the  Army  Management Structure Code System  for  manpower programming and budgeting.

To reduce  the inordinate  amount of man-hours  needed  to review TAADS periodically, the Allocation and Documentation Division of  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel contracted  with  ASM  &amp;  Associates  in  March  1981  for  the de› velopment of a computer program that will  identify documents in  need of review.  The program,  known  as  Automated Identi› fication of Documents for Review (AIDR), will assist manpower analysts in screening out from the several thousand TAADS doc› uments  those  that  need  detailed  review.  AIDR  has  two  basic screening routines.  One is  fixed and looks at specific units and total increases in predetermined grades, specialty skill identifiers, and MOSs. The other is a flexible routine that monitors a known set of resource changes approved for implementation, such as a major strength change in a  unit or several  units.  The first  full operational  test  of AIDR  is  scheduled for  the first  quarter  of fiscal  year  1982.  The results  will  be given  to  the  major  Army commands, and a procedure will be established for extending the AIDR program to T AADS offices of these major commands.

Organizationally, a DOD directive dated 12 March 1981, en› titled  "Department of Defense Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support,''  caused the Army to revise its list of  man› agement headquarters activities and to add approximately 1,900 personnel to the rolls of Army management headquarters activ› ities from other Army personnel accounts.

## Civilian Personnel

In fiscal  year  1981  civilian personnel continued to be a high priority in  the Army.  Early in  the fiscal  year the Deputy Chief of  Staff  for Personnel publicly stated that the shortage of  civilian employees was  the Army's most important personnel problem, of  more concern to the Army staff than active Army and reserve component recruiting.

Although the ratio of  military personnel to civilians in military functions dropped sharply at the end of the Vietnam War and remained almost constant through fiscal year 1981 (about 2.4 to 1),  the  number of civilians  in  military  functions  (excluding  in› direct hire overseas support personnel) decreased greatly in ab› solute  terms:  from  367,300  in June  1972  to  310,000  in September 1980. Since  1974,  the number of Army civilians in military functions  has dropped about  10 percent, while overall federal employment decreased only 1 percent over the same pe-

riod. Because civilian support personnel take longer to mobilize than military personnel, the Army considers a strong peacetime civilian  force  a  necessity  if it  is  to win  the opening battles of a future war.

In a joint statement to Congress early in the fiscal  year,  the Secretary of the  Army  and  the  Chief of Staff emphasized the critical role of Army civilians in the first stages of a  war:

The present civilian work force, on whom we will depend for many critical mobilization  needs,  is  inadequate  to perform  even  the everyday tasks  of sup› porting the peacetime Army. It is far below levels required if a  major mobili› zation 1s  called. The gap between required and available personnel cannot be quickly  closed  by our emergency augmentation plans because of the current low civilian strength levels and the large surge in requirements at mobilization.

Before presenting the fiscal  year  1981  supplemental budget re› quest,  the  Army  estimated  that  current  civilian  strength  was 65,000 below the level needed to meet peacetime requirements.

Despite various hiring restrictions for civilian  personnel im› posed during the year, the Army civilian strength, including over› seas indirect hires, increased from  360,508 to 372,111  in fiscal year 1981. The one-for-two hiring limitation imposed on the De› partment of the Army by President Carter in March 1980 lasted until  19 January  1981, when  President Reagan imposed a  total freeze on outside hiring that lasted until 17 February. When the freeze  was  lifted,  the Army civilian ceiling was  increased about 10,000 spaces. In  July, in the midst of  a Department of  the Army hiring surge to reach the new increased authorization, the full› time permanent ceiling was  suddenly reduced by 8,837 spaces. Since the Army now had a  surplus of full-time  permanent em› ployees rather than a shortage, a hiring delay was imposed, which in  turn delayed  the starting dates  for  many  new  full-time  per› manent employees until after 30 September.

At the end of the fiscal  year, civilian end strength in military functions was 372,111 against an authorized strength of  372,533, a  fill  rate  of 99.9  percent.  Employee strength in full-time,  per› manent  positions  was  289,156  versus  an  authorized  level  of 289,700,  a  fill  rate  of 99.8  percent.  Although  the  Army  was within the total employment ceiling, it exceeded the direct hire limit of 314,642 by approximately 3,600 employees.  Represen› tation of minorities and women increased from  18.8 percent to 19.8 percent and from 36.8 percent to 37.7 percent, respectively.

One of the main arguments the Army has used before Con› gress to justify increased civilian  personnel is  that commanders are reporting that large numbers of  military personnel are being

diverted  from  military  functions  to jobs that could be held by civilians.  During a  mobilization,  many  of these soldiers  would resume their military functions, leaving many important support jobs unfilled. In fiscal year 1981 the number of  soldiers perform› ing jobs  for  which  documented  requirements  existed  but  for which civilian manpower authorizations or assigned civilians were lacking (known as borrowed military manpower) averaged, as in past years,  13,000 to 14,000. Another 12,000 to 14,000 troops a  day were diverted to tasks still undocumented as requirements but necessary to peacetime support.

During fiscal  year  1981, Congress authorized for  the Army a total of 16,800 civilian spaces to reduce borrowed military man› power and other troop diversions. The Army allocated 6,500 of these  spaces  for  use  in fiscal  year  1981, and  the  remainder for fiscal  year  1982.  From  March  through  September  1981  about 6,000 civilians were hired, allowing some 5,400 soldiers to return to  their  military assignments,  thus  improving unit training and readiness.  By  30 September  1981,  reported  borrowed  military manpower  had  dropped  to  10,500  soldiers.  The Army  Audit Agency and the General Accounting Office are scheduled to re› view the civilian increase in fiscal  year 1982, and borrowed mil› itary manpower remains a special interest of the Department of the Army Inspector General.

In fiscal year 1981 the Army continued to implement the Stop Grade Escalation policy  begun the preceding fiscal  year.  While the program set no absolute average-grade ceiling, the goal was to remain at or below the fiscal year 1979 average grade of 7.56. An increase in  this average would be allowed only if proven to be necessary.  In fiscal  year  1980 the average grade remained at 7.56, but in fiscal  year  1981  it rose slightly to 7.61.

The Army also  successfully  implemented  the  performance appraisal provisions of Title II of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 for merit pay, General Schedule (GS), and Federal Wage System (FWS)  employees.  A  comprehensive two-phase  training program for supervisors and managers of employees covered by these provisions commenced in December 19  7  8 and ended before the system  was  implemented.  The new  merit pay  performance appraisal  system  became  effective  on  I  October  1980.  Imple› mentation of  the General Performance Appraisal System (GPAS), covering  GS  and  FWS  employees,  began  on  1  May  1981  and continued throughout the rest of fiscal  year 1981.  Negotiations with  labor  organizations,  however,  delayed  the implementation at several activities, where management's  last best offer was then put into effect, subject to further negotiation and modification.

By  the  end of the  fiscal  year about  270,000  employees, or 95 percent of those intended, had received written GPAS major  job elements and performance standards.

The fiscal  year 1981  program of  encouraging cost-saving sug› gestions from employees proved less successful than in fiscal year 1980, but the program still realized savings of  over $69.8 million from  numerous  employee  suggestions  and  significant  achieve› ments.  Adopted suggestions  of military  and  civilian  personnel saved $34.6 million. A civilian employee of  the U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range won recognition as the outstanding contrib› utor of the  year  for  his  suggestion  which  saved approximately $4.1  million  the first  year. The Department of Defense Appro› priations Act of 1980 provided for full participation by reservists and National Guard members in the suggestion program, making them eligible to  receive cash award for their inventions and sci› entific achievements.

On  9  September  1980  the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve  Affairs) approved development of the Army  Automated Civilian  Personnel System (ACPERS), a  fully automated information system to support mobilization and peace› time requirements of all  functional  areas of Army civilian  per› sonnel  management.  During its start-up phase (fiscal  year  1981 to 1985) the system will  be contracted to industry at a cost of $6 to  $7  million.  The contract is  scheduled to be awarded in  Feb› ruary  1983,  with  production  deliveries  to  begin  in February 1984. ACPERS will  replace all automated civilian personnel sys› tems currently being operated in the Army.

Unfair labor practice charges continued at an extremely high rate in fiscal  year  1981  compared with  the number filed before the  passage  of the  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  of 1978.  In con› junction with the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Army recommended major changes in the way  the Federal Labor Re› lations  Authority  handled these  charges.  To remedy  the  over› legalization and increasingly adversarial nature of  the system, the Army urged several  changes, such as requiring an  informal at› tempt at resolution before formal charges were filed.

But the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) continued to expand the scope of bargaining in federal labor-management relations, and federal courts upheld a number of the authority's early decisions,  such as  those  that required bargaining on stays of disciplinary  actions  and  on  details  by  seniority.  Only  in  as› signing work and contracting it out was management's  right not to bargain left intact.  Instead of asserting its right not to  nego-

tiate,  the  Army  began  to  emphasize  discovering  strategies  for winning acceptable agreements at the bargaining table.

During the fiscal  year a  FLRA decision  forced  the  Depart› ment of the Army to reassess its position on including many staff action officers in the merit pay system for supervisors and man› agers in grades GS-13 through GS- 15. The Army's  broad inter› pretation  of  the  statutory  term management  ojfu:ial, used  to determine which employees may be included in  bargaining units and which  employees  are subject  to  the  merit pay  system,  was invalidated  by  an  FLRA decision  that  took  a  more  restrictive view of the term. At the end of the fiscal year the Army was still assessing the effect of  that decision on its merit pay system. Sev› eral thousand employees originaIJy targeted for the new system, which is scheduled to go into effect 1 October 1981, will probably have to be excluded.

Bargaining unit membership increased slightly, from 198,722 employees in 613 bargaining units to 200,115 employees in 609 bargaining units (excluding Army National Guard figures).

In the DOD Authorization Act for  1978, Congress required a  6-percent  reduction  in  the  number  of civilian  employees  at grade GS-13 and above by the end of  fiscal year 1980. The DOD Authorization  Act for  1981  amended the 1978 act, requiring a 4-percent reduction by 30 September 1981 and an additional 2percent reduction  by  30  September  1982.  The  Office  of the Secretary of Defense, however, stated that the full  6-percent cut would be completed by 30 September 1981. Although the Army was successful in  its  fiscal  year  1980 reduction program, ending the year 221  positions below the ceiling of 18,892, it ended fiscal year  1981  with 409 positions over the same assigned ceiling.

As of mid-September  1981, scientific and engineering posi› tions accounted for  52 percent of the Army's total senior-level positions.

The Department of the Army has tried unsuccessfully to ob› tain OSD exemption of civilian physicians, employees in  foreign military sales projects,  and workers  in  other  reimbursable pro› grams from the high grade ceiling. In fiscal year 1981  prospects for congressional repeal of the statutory reduction appeared fa› vorable.  But the Office of the Secretary of Defense took no of› ficial position regarding the current ceilings or  the possible repeal of the requirement. If  the Department of the Army has to meet its assigned  30 September  1982 ceiling, it will  have  to cut over 800 filled  positions during fiscal  year I  982.

In fiscal year 1981  congressionally imposed pay caps and the steady erosion of  benefits continued to make the Senior Executive

.....

Service (SES) of the Army, as in other agencies, a troubled area. Although this year was better than last, recruitment  and retention still suffered. Six large private industrial firms requested that they no longer be on the distribution list for Army SES vacancy an› nouncements, and few SES applications were received from can› didates outside the federal service. In fiscal year 1981, Congress' pay  cap equalized the pay  of officials at nine levels of responsi› bility,  ranging  from  GS-14,  step  9,  up  through  SES  Level  V. Some gains  were  registered,  however.  SES  vacancies  were  re› duced from 79 at the end of  fiscal year 1980 to 57 at the end of fiscal year 1981. Twenty-six Army SES officials, or about 12 per› cent of the total,  retired during the year, compared with  55 in fiscal  year 1980. The pay cap seems to have been the key factor in  most of the retirement decisions.

In accordance with congressional actions and OPM guidance, the Army in early fiscal  year  1981  awarded bonuses to only 52 of  its SES members, compared with the original 178 eligible un› der the Civil Service Reform Act.  Similar problems appeared in the program of Presidential Rank Awards for SES members. In April  1981  the Secretary of the Army forwarded to the  Office of  the Secretary of  Defense five nominations of  senior executives for the Distinguished Rank Award and twenty-one nominations for  the Meritorious Rank Award. OSD forwarded all  the Army nominations to the Office of Personnel Management, which con› vened the SES review panels. The President eventually approved only twelve Army awards, two Distinguished Rank and ten Mer› itorious Rank, a reduction of  more than 50 percent of  the Army's nominations.

One small victory in the management of  the Army's  SES pro› gram came on 22 May  1981  when the Deputy Secretary of De› fense delegated authority to the Secretary of the Army to set or adjust SES pay  to the ES-5 and ES-6 levels.  Two pay rates for executives were adjusted to ES-6, and twenty-eight were adjusted to ES-5 for fiscal year  1981.

In October 1980  the  Army announced a  Candidate Devel› opment Program for SES managers with high potential. A screen› ing and selection  process  chose  twenty-six  participants  in  nine functional fields.  The candidates and their assigned advisers re› ceived orientation to instruct and advise them on the drafting of Individual Development Plans.

## 6. Human Resources Development

The field of human resources development in the Army en› compasses almost all programs designed to improve the standard of living, education, leadership, and morale of Army personnel. It also  includes preventive and  remedial efforts in  the areas of alcohol and drug abuse, accident prevention, discipline, and law enforcement.

To improve professionalism,  the  Army  this  year  continued efforts to assure its officers and soldiers that they are important participants in a strong and vital arm of  the nation's  defenses and to show  them in various ways  that the Army as a  whole has na› tional  support  and  a  clearly  defined  mission  and  role.  In July 1981, for example,  the White House announced that President Reagan had created a new Military Manpower Task Force, whose goal would be to restore military people to first-class citizenship by awarding them better pay and new education benefits and, in general, by improving the quality of military life. The task force included several key White House advisers, all of the service sec› retaries,  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  the di› rector-designate of the Selective Service System.

## Leadership and Motivation

As  it  has since  1976,  the Army  this year used its  Organiza› tional  Effectiveness  (OE)  program as  one  means of raising  the quality of  command and management practices. Almost 750 OE staff  officers, trained at  TRADOC's  Organizational Effectiveness Center and School at Fort Ord, California, were available to assist unit  commanders,  especially  those  newly  assigned,  in  setting goals,  establishing methods of achieving them, developing lead› ership theory, and measuring unit progress. A principal objective of OE efforts  was  to  increase  a  unit's combat effectiveness  by making the chain of command more cohesive.

In the interest  of  promoting the ethical behavior of  its leaders, the Army has developed a  program of instruction in ethics for presentation in  ROTC and basic officer courses.  Given  the im› portance of  ethical behavior by all members of  the military profes› sion, a  broader program of instruction is being developed for all officers and enlisted personnel. In a related matter, the Secretary of the Army approved the administration of an oath to commis-

sioned officers detailed as inspectors general. The Inspector Gen› eral had recommended the oath as a means of  further identifying inspectors general as impartial fact-finders and problem solvers. The oath will  also  remind newly  detailed inspectors general  of their moral and ethical obligations.

Semiannual  soldier  opinion  surveys  used  throughout  the Army to assess command climate confirmed this year that a major turning point had been reached in the way soldiers perceived the Army. The career intentions of  enlisted soldiers were higher than at any  time during the era of the all-volunteer force, and more of them than ever before expressed a willingness to recommend Army service to friends and relatives.  Their expressions of  job satisfaction and attitudes toward their leaders showed improve› ment. Likewise, assessments by officers of  the leadership of  other officers and noncommissioned officers and of  soldier morale, dis› cipline, motivation, and trainability reflected significant progress. The career intentions of  junior officers had also noticeably im› proved, and officers in general expressed greater satisfaction with their jobs.

## Quality of Life

This year the  Quality of Life  Program, after three years of planning and programming, at last received enough funding to make a noticeable difference for soldiers and their families. The living and working conditions of soldiers, especially in  Europe, visibly  improved.

The fiscal  year  I 981  budget provided a  substantial increase in funds for the construction of  family housing units and barracks, for the  modernization  of medical and  dental  clinics,  for  larger allowances for variable housing and permanent change of  station, and for larger staffs and more supplies and equipment to support Army community activities relating to morale, welfare, and rec› reation.

This year  the  Army completed development of a  resource packaging program titled "Personnel Readiness and Retention." Expected to cost $1.6 billion over five years,  the program is de› signed  to  provide  a  balanced  approach  toward  funding  those needs of the soldiers that have the most affect on their intent to stay  in  the  Army  and  their  personal  readiness  to  execute  the Army's mission.

In  the  past,  quality of life  efforts  have  been handicapped in the competition for limited resources by the Army's inability to quantify the benefits derived from implementing the initiatives.

There was no obvious way to measure soldier satisfaction and its effect on  soldier commitment.  To cope  with  this  problem,  the Army hired the Orkand Corporation, a consulting firm,  to de› velop a  model  to forecast  the effects of quality of life initiatives and the  necessary levels  of funding  to achieve  the  greatest  im› provement in retention. The model is scheduled for completion in  April  1983.

Apart from securing adequate funding,  Quality of Life pro› gram  managers have focused  their efforts on upgrading family life. In  October  1980  the  Army  Officers' Wives  Club  of the Greater  Washington  Area  and  the  Association  of the  United States Army sponsored the first Army Family Symposium,  held in  Washington,  D.C.  Almost  200  delegates  and  observers  at› tended,  consisting  mostly of Army wives from  installations and units worldwide. The symposium resulted in  the creation of the Family Action Committee, composed of  wives from the National Capital Region who had served on the original family symposium steering committee.

The committee recommended several actions which the Chief of  Staff  later  approved. The Family Liaison Office was established within  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel  to oversee all family  issues. The Adjutant General's Office opened a  Department of the Army Family Life Communications Line in the Pentagon on 8 September 1981. This 24-hour, toll-free ser› vice within the United States, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico enables family  members of active and reserve  component per› sonnel, civilian  employees,  retired personnel, and  other service personnel stationed with Army elements to communicate directly with  Headquarters,  Department of the Army.  Family members will  be  able  to  obtain  information  and referral  regarding pro› grams that affect family life. Major Army commands overseas are expected to set up an intracommand system by which appropriate calls can be referred to Headquarters, Department of the Army, for response by an Army staff or other agency.

In another initiative, the Department of  the Army Periodicals Review Committee approved a quarterly family newsletter to be printed by T AGO and distributed to Army families worldwide. The Chief of  Staff approved the basic concepts for a  number of new job centers, career planning seminars, and a  skill bank sys› tem.  The Chief of Staff also  directed the  general  use  in  Army publications of the terms family member or spouse in  place of de› pendent, and he issued a policy statement supporting the right of family members to be employed without limiting a service mem› ber's  assignment or position in the government. The policy state-

ment  read  in  part:  "The  inability  of a  spouse  personally  to volunteer services or perform a role to complement the service› member's  discharge of  military duties normally is a private matter and  should  not  be  a  factor  in  the  individual's selection  for  a military position."

## Pay, Leave, and Travel

The fiscal  year 1981  Defense Authorization Bill provided im› provements in  military compensation. It increased military basic pay and allowances by 11.7 percent, provided a family separation allowance for E-ls  through E-4s who are stationed overseas with› out their dependents, increased the PCS (permanent change of station)  movement allowance for  house trailers, increased TDY (temporary duty) per diem reimbursement from $35 to $50, and raised  the  limit  on  this  reimbursement in  high-cost  areas from $50 to  $75 a day.  The bill also authorized substantial increases in military bonuses. It raised enlistment bonuses from $3,000 to $5,000, and reenlistment bonuses from $15,000 to $20,000. It authorized reenlistment bonuses, for the first time, for members of  the Individual Ready Reserve and for active duty service mem› bers with ten to fourteen years of  service. The bill also continued bonus authority for  pilots,  even though  Congress appropriated no funds for this purpose.

The Military Pay and Allowance Benefits Act of 1980, which became  law  on 23  December  1980,  provided an optional  basic allowance for quarters (BAQ) for bachelor E-7s and above, and also  set  up a  bonus  pay,  leave,  and  travel  package  for SIMOS personnel  who  extend  their  overseas  tours.  The act redefined Regular Military Compensation to include a new variable housing allowance  (VHA) or overseas station housing allowance (SHA). Regular Military  Compensation  now  included  these allowances for subsistence.

The new variable housing allowance, which originated in the Nunn-Warner  amendment  that  became  law  on  8  September 1980, is  intended  to  help defray  high housing costs for service members stationed in  the  continental  United States.  Personnel who are · not living in government quarters but are assigned to a permanent station are eligible to receive  the full  difference be› tween  the average housing costs in  their area and  115  percent of the average basic allowance for quarters.  Personnel assigned to a permanent station outside the continental United States, and whose  dependents  reside  in  an area  within  the  United  States where the average cost of housing exceeds the average basic al-

lowance for quarters by 15 percent or more, are also eligible for VHA payments. The Department of Defense set funding levels this fiscal  year, and the VHA wiU  become an entitlement in fiscal year  1982.

The Nunn-Warner amendment also increased the PCS mile› age rate  from  $.10 a  mile  to $.185 a  mile,  effective  1  October 1980.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, which be› came law on 13 August 1981, change the semiannual adjustment of  retired and retainer pay (which had been adjusted on I  March and 1 September) to one that is annual (occurring on 1 March). Because of the new  law  there was no adjustment to retired and retainer pay  on  1 September  1981.  Such pay  was  scheduled to be increased on 1 March 1982 by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for  the period from  1 January  through 31  December 1981.

Federal  law  requires that percentage increases in survivors' annuities and  in  pensions subject to  the dual compensation  re› striction  (5  USC  5532)  must be  handled  on  the  same  basis  as percentage increases in retired and retainer pay. Therefore, per› centage increases  in  the survivors' annuities and  dual compen› sation amounts have also been placed on an annual basis.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

This fiscal year the Army continued to make progress in de› veloping the effective and efficient management of  resources and facilities  used for morale, welfare, and recreation. With the con› currence of the Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Review Committee, The Adjutant General's Office established a  users' task  force  to  determine  specific  needs  of the  Army  for  infor› mation  relating to  the  management,  control,  and  oversight  of nonappropriated funds. Task force members, representing Army headquarters  and  the  major  commands,  discussed  reporting problems  and  changes  needed  to  achieve  greater  uniformity among the major commands in the management of nonappro› priated funds.  A major step agreed upon was  to bring all Army commands  except  Korea  into a  centralized  automated  payroll system for  employees paid with  nonappropriated funds. By  the end of the fiscal  year,  among those commands slated for  incor› poration, only Europe remained outside the centralized system. In another major step, in July 1981, new procedures were insti› tuted for the reimbursement of nonappropriated fund programs with appropriated funds.  The Army is  now  using fewer nonap-

propriated funds for operating expenses and ensuring that mo› rale,  welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs are administered in strict compliance with governing regulations.

During fiscal year 1981 The Adjutant General's  Office nearly completed the establishment of the Nonappropriated Fund Cen› tral Banking Program in the United States. Under this program all  cash  resources  from  nonappropriated  morale,  welfare,  and recreation funds  will  be  concentrated at a  central  bank  where they will be invested. Managers of  morale, welfare, and recreation programs will draw upon the funds as needed for operations or facility  improvements.

Congress  has  recently  taken  an  interest  in  the  number  of military  personnel  assigned  to  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation positions,  both  full  and  part  time,  and  has  put ceilings  on  the number of such positions. This fiscal year the Office of the Sec› retary of Defense directed the services  to comply with  the leg› islation.

TAGGEN's Army Community Service Division this year con› tinued to administer several  programs designed to improve the quality  of life  of soldiers  and  their  families.  One  focus  of the division's work  was  planning for  implementation  in  fiscal  year 1982  of the  Army  Consumer  Affairs-Financial  Planning  Pro› gram. The program will  be organized parallel to federal,  state, and local  consumer protection offices.  It will  offer guidance to service  members seeking  consumer  information  and  will  be  a mechanism for resolving consumer complaints.

In May 1981 the Army expanded its Child Advocacy Program into a Family Advocacy Program, which now includes services to prevent spouse and child abuse and neglect. The program is de› signed  to  help  prevent,  evaluate,  treat,  and  report  child  and spouse  maltreatment,  including physical  and  sexual  abuse  and physical, psychological, and emotional neglect. The detailed ob› jectives of  the program are expected to be published in AR 6081 (Army Community Service Program) in June 1983.

As  the fiscal  year came  to  a  close,  the  Army  was  preparing to  conduct an  "open season"  to  allow  eligible  retired  service members to take  part in  or increase  their  participation  in  the Survivor Benefit Plan.  Eligible  members  may  enroll  initially  in the plan, increase their contribution, expand their current cov› erage to include their spouse as well as children, or elect coverage for someone with an insurable interest if the retired member has no spouse or dependent child.  Congress,  which authorized the larger program in August  1981, requires a  two-year waiting pe-

riod before the designated beneficiary becomes eligible to receive an annuity.

As part of  its community support  effort, the Army participates in  the ceremonial activities of Arlington National Cemetery.  In April  1981  the  Army  accepted  ten  Lippizan  stallions  as  a  gift from Tempel Steel Company. The horses belong to a breed with 400 years of military tradition. The ten donated horses are de› scended from a herd of Lippizans that General George S.  Patton, Jr., saved from  the destruction of World War II for the Spanish Riding  School  in  Vienna.  The ten  horses  will  be  used  by  the Caisson  Platoon  of  the  3d  United  States  Infantry  (The  Old Guard) for ceremonial purposes at Arlington Cemetery.

The  Armed  Forces  Professional  Entertainment  Office (AFPEO),  in  conjunction  with  the  USO  (United  Service  Or› ganizations),  continued  to  provide  live  professional  entertain› ment to the Army overseas.  Among tqe many entertainers sent abroad were Suzanne Somers,  the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, Miss  America, Miss Black World, the Crown Beauties of  Soul, a troupe of former Miss  Black Americas, and television star Nor› man Fell.

In October 1980 the Department of Defense assumed com› plete responsibility for the administrative processing  of  all touring groups selected by AFPEO and the USO. The USO agreed to provide press releases for all touring groups selected by AFPEO.

In this fiscal  year the Army Photography Contest became an annual event. The contest in September 1981 at Aberdeen Prov› ing Ground, Maryland, produced 72 winners from 831  entries. The winners will be entered in the 18th Interservice Photography Contest scheduled for December 1982.

The Army Art Contest held every four years was judged 25 September 1981 at Fort Meyer, Virginia. The 193 entries from 10  major  Army  commands  represented  33  CONUS  and  68 OCONUS installations and sites.

This year the  Army lost its  two-year-old  title at the twenty› second annual Armed Forces lnterservice Chess Championship, sponsored by the American Legion and the American Chess Fed› eration.  For the first time  in  twenty  years  of interservice chess competition, the sea services teams defeated both Army and Air Force teams. The ten-day event tested the chess skills of  the six› member teams that were selected in  earlier intraservice compe› tition. The event took place in the American Legion Hall of  Flags in September 1981.

Teams and individual competitors in a variety of  sports took part in  interservice,  national, and international championships.

In interservice competition,  Army victories included  first-place finishes  in  track and field,  boxing, soccer, and men's basketball. In international military competition, the Army was first in par› achuting,  helicopter  flying,  shooting,  and  boxing.  SFC James Grant of Fort Bragg, the 1981 Army boxing coach, was selected as the National Boxing Coach of the Year by the USA Amateur Boxing Federation. Five Army boxers were selected to the 1981 All-American boxing team.

In  1981  the Army  published a  pamphlet entitled "Hazards in  the  Arts"  to alert personnel in  Army arts and crafts centers to the growing evidence of health hazards involved in exposure to  many  toxic  art materials.  In conjunction with  federal  health officials and agencies, the Army is looking for ways  to minimize the hazards in  its arts and crafts programs.

This fiscal  year the  number of Army libraries participating in  the  Federal  Library  Information  Network  increased  from thirty-eight  to  forty-one.  The  Army  purchased  191,318  cloth› bound books for its  libraries and obtained  27,  73  l  paperbound book kits  of twenty  titles  each  for  distribution  to  military  per› sonnel without access to libraries. There were special  purchases of children's books and Spanish-language publications.

This year the Army continued to  increase funding for con› struction  of a  variety  of morale  support  facilities.  Most  were sports facilities,  but there were also  two  travel  parks, five  auto self-help centers, a craft shop, and two dependent youth activity facilities.

During fiscal  year  1981  Army  clubs  had a  total revenue  of $256.81  million, a 7-percent increase over l 980. Sales increased 7  percent in  1981, up to $187.45 million. Net income increased 17  percent, up to $21.34 million  (8.3  percent of revenue). The year's most notable progress came in food operations, which re› alized a  $3.63-million net income (4 percent of sales) compared with a net income of $73,097 (.1  percent of sales) in  1980.

Braced by six consecutive years of favorable  financial  oper› ating results,  Army clubs were being renovated and built at an unprecedented rate in fiscal  year  1981.  At the end of the year there  were  fifty-two  club projects  in  various stages of develop› ment, with $71  million in  facility  improvements scheduled over the next five years. During I  981 seven installations in the United States  started  new  construction  projects,  and  six  others  began renovations. Six projects were completed in fiscal  year I 981.  In Europe facility  improvement projects costing $25 million  were under way,  and  two club projects  were being designed  for  the Army in  Korea.

Package beverage stores increased their net income  10 per› cent from last year, up to $18.59 million. The stores distributed $6.47 million for morale support activities, compared with $4.47 million  in  fiscal  year  1980.  This  fiscal  year  the package stores retained $2.37 million for capitalization. Total store revenue was $115.  94 million, a  9-percent increase from fiscal  year  I  980.

The Adjutant General's  Office this year began a phased rein› statement of recreational (slot) machines in overseas areas where permitted under status of  forces or other local agreements. Army clubs in the Kaiserslautern and Frankfort military communities received  250  machines.  Profits from  the machines will  be used to improve the clubs and other recreational facilities.

The Army Bands Office conducted auditions during the fiscal year to find potential band officers for its new career management plan, which was begun last year. The office also developed several successful  recruiting  measures  to  assist  USAREC  in  attracting potential band members. This fiscal year the Army also developed a  doctrine  for  using  bands  at  division  and  higher  echelons  in support of combat operations.  To assist  commanders in  main› taining morale among their troops, bands will offer music when› ever opportunities arise.  When  combat becomes intense,  band members are to assume secondary duties:  security of command posts,  perimeter  defense,  traffic  control,  and security  for  pris› oners of war.  Commanders will  also  take  every opportunity  to use  their bands to foster  good  will  among civilians  in  zones  of operations.

## Equal Opportunity

This fiscal  year  the newly  appointed Secretaries of Defense and the Army published and disseminated policy statements out› lining  their  commitment  to  equal  opportunity.  The  equal  op› portunity staff at Headquarters,  Department of the  Army, continued to impress on all levels of  command that fostering equal opportunity for Army minorities plays a  key  role in promoting soldier effectiveness and unit cohesion. The staff  participated in several functions sponsored by Blacks in Government, Women's Forum, the National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People, the Urban League, American G.I. Forum, Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Week,  Asian-Pacific  American  Heri› tage  Week,  the  National  Congress  of American  Indians,  and others.

The equal opportunity staff took steps  in conjunction  with TRADOC to  revitalize  the  Army's equal  opportunity training

program. The Department of the Army conducted a  program analysis of  several major Army commands. The analysis resulted in a  number of proposed policy changes to be implemented by the end of next fiscal year,  including new and extensive instruc› tion on countering sexual harassment.

Based on guidance received from the Equal Employment Op› portunity Commission, the Department of the Army developed a  Transition  Year  Affirmative  Action  Program  Plan.  Occupa› tional series (job categories) were evaluated for representation of minority group members and women. Department of the Army representation was compared with civilian labor force data that reported the availability of women and members of certain  mi› nority groups with comparable skills. Where groups were found to be underrepresented in  the Army work force,  they were tar› geted for placement by  numerical goals.  Only four series  were targeted in  the transitional year.  During a  period when  hiring restrictions  were  imposed,  the  Army succeeded  in  meeting or exceeding its goals for  three of the four targeted occupational series in the majority of  grade levels comprising entry, midlevel, and senior groupings.

The Department of the Army this fiscal  year allocated  227 man-years and $6.2 million in  administrative costs  to survey its requirements  for  developing  Federal  Equal  Opportunity  Re› cruitment Programs. As a result, the Army identified each major operating component in the department that is required to de› velop  and  implement such  programs and  assessed  the  compo› nents' determinations  of underrepresentations,  internal  and external recruitment activities, interagency programs, and estab› lishment of representative applicant pooJs.

In the area of external recruitment, the Office of Personnel Management delegated to the Army the authority to conduct its own examinations, to identify jobs that could be redesigned by requiring bilingual or bicultural capabilities or by  not requiring fluency in English, to recruit at historically black colleges and at colleges with a high enrollment of  women and minorities, and to support interagency clearinghouses in metropolitan areas.

The purpose of the Army's Severely Handicapped Affirma› tive Recruitment Program is to hire employees with severe hand› icaps,  such  as  deafness,  blindness,  or missing  extremities.  The program  is  open  to  disabled  veterans.  In fiscal  year  1981  the Army was not able to meet its goal of obtaining at least  1.5 per› cent of all  new personnel with  severe handicaps.

## Education

The Army's  continuing educational efforts seek to benefit the Army as well as to support the soldier's  personal and professional goals.  Army  benefits  encompass  efforts  to  support  readiness through improved professionalism and skill proficiency, increased recruitment and retention,  as  well  as  advanced  technology  ex› pertise. Support for the soldier is aimed at increasing self-esteem and motivation; enhancing professional development, military ef› fectiveness,  and  leadership  abilities;  and  providing  productive postservice career skills.

In accordance with  the fiscal  year  1981  Department of De› fense  Authorization  Act,  the  Army conducted one-year tests of four  different postservice  educational  incentives:  loan  forgive› ness; a miniature G.I. Bill proposed by the House Armed Services Committee;  a  noncontributory  veterans  educational  assistance program  proposed  by  the  Senate  Armed Services  Committee; and an "ultra"  contributory educational assistance program. For a  four-year  enlistment during  fiscal  year  1981,  a  recruit could combine one of these initiatives with  an enlistment bonus in se› lected military occupational specialties. The test goal was to assess the effect of these special  incentives over and above that of the preexisting basic  contributory  Veterans  Educational  Assistance Program  (VEAP).  The  Army,  like  the  other services,  already supports the concept of a  G.I.  Bill-a noncontributory college educational incentive program that would replace VEAP.

In fiscal  year  1981  the Army favored a  G.I.  Bill  that would double the monthly allowance for soldiers with six or more years of honorable service.  It would also authorize the transfer of  all unused benefits to children and spouses of  active duty personnel with  more than  ten  years  of service.  In addition,  the Army be› lieves  that a  provision  benefit is  needed to fill  critical specialty shortages. At  the close of  the fiscal year, Congress  was considering a  variety of  draft G.I.  bills.

The  Army  Continuing Education  System  (ACES)  provides off-duty  voluntary  educational  opportunities  and  on-duty job› related educational programs.  ACES funds are administered by the Army Education Directorate, Office of  the Adjutant General. These funds  may be used to pay  for off-duty college programs, vocational and technical courses, and skill development programs such as the Army Apprenticeship Program. The apprenticeship program allows  soldiers to document their actual  work experi› ence and to earn a  Department of Labor Journeyworker's Cer› tificate upon successful completion.

The Basic Skills Education Program remained the command› er's primary on-duty educational tool  to upgrade reading, writ› ing, speaking, listening, and math skills that are related to duty performance.  Provided at no cost  to  the  service  member,  the program  calls  for  maximum  decentralization  and  flexibility  so that commanders may mold content and delivery methods to fit command  and  mission  requirements.  The  commander  is  en› couraged to give priority of  enrollment to those soldiers with the greatest chance for success  and,  therefore,  retention.  Improve› ments are under way  which  will  enhance the  program substan› tially  in the  next few  years.

During the fiscal  year the English  Language  Branch of the Defense Language Institute's Language Center at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, completed a six-month residency program for 200 soldiers needing instruction in English as a sec› ond  language  (ESL).  The  institute  also  began  a  similar  three› month program for  I 51  soldiers to  help  in  developing a  long› range Army policy for providing English as a  second language. By the end of the fiscal year, some 5,800 soldiers had completed the Army's resident and nonresident ESL courses, which are part of the Basic Skills Education Program.

The Advanced Skills Education Program (ASEP) is intended to provide on-duty remedial education to noncommissioned of› ficers  (E-6  and above)  and  to  improve  duty performance.  Re› gionally accredited educational institutions are normally awarded contracts for the development of  ASEP courses to meet objectives determined by the installation commander and education services officer.

The Servicemembers Opportunity College Associate Degree (SOCAD) program consists of forty-five  accredited civilian schools  which  offer off-duty  college associate  degree  programs in sixteen occupational areas. Extension of  the SOCAD program to Europe, the Pacific, and the Far East, scheduled for this fiscal year, has been delayed.

This fiscal  year saw  the beginning but not the end of a con› troversy over sharp reductions in  federal  financial aid to school districts that must educate large numbers of  students from legally nonresident military families, especially those who .reside on fed› eral property and pay no local property taxes. The basis of  Con› gress' rationale for providing this impact aid since 1950 has been that federal property is exempt from state and local taxation and that some local school districts depend on such taxation as their main source of  education funds. Without federal reimbursement, in  the form  of impact aid, local districts are left with the choice

of  reducing the per-pupil expenditure for both military and non› military students in  the district, or raising local taxes on nonfed› eral real  property, or eliminating the provision of a  free public education to students from  military families.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of fiscal  year 1981 provided $475 million for the Impact Aid Program, a reduction of$723 million from the previous year. In response to anticipated cuts in  impact aid,  several  states and  their local  school  districts prepared to charge tuition for the public education of members of military  families.  The  Secretary  of  Defense,  however,  an› nounced  that  no  service  member  would  be  forced  to  pay  for public education. He obtained a commitment by the Department of  Justice to take school districts to court to ensure that children of military  families  would  be  educated  at  no  expense  to  their parents.  The  concerned  state  education  agencies  likewise  ex› pressed their willingness to pursue court action to obtain tuition fees in lieu of impact aid.

At the end of the fiscal  year two states (Virginia and North Carolina)  had  passed  tuition  legislation,  and  their  local  school districts had taken measures to charge tuition to military families. The Department of Defense  was  having difficulty  in  finding a congressional  sponsor  for  a  bill  to  prohibit  any  state  or  local education authority from denying a free public education to chil› dren of military families  residing on federal property.

In response to a request by the Chief of  Staff, four additional states have granted military personnel and their family members resident status for tuition purposes at state colleges and univers› ities.  Thirty-three states now extend such support. Seventeen of the twenty-one states who were asked for such support this year, however,  have declined to return a favorable response.

## Alcohol and Drug Abuse

The Army Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program (ADAPCP) is made up of  prevention, identification, and rehabilitation services.  During fiscal  year  1981  a total of 26,385 active duty personnel entered ADAPCP treatment programs. Of those individuals whose treatment year (360 days) ended in fiscal year 1981, a total of 17,065, or 65 percent, completed treatment and were returned to active duty.

The Department of Defense recently contracted for a study of  drug and alcohol abuse in the military which shows that, while the Army has a better record in this area than the Navy or Marine Corps, its record does not match that of the Air Force. Of  those

Army  personnel  who  responded  to  the survey,  24  percent ad› mitted at least some incidents of work impairment in  1979 and early  1980 because of alcohol use,  and  22 percent (E-1  to E-5 only)  because of drug  use.  Drug  use  occurred almost  entirely among personnel in  pay grades E-1  through E-5. Overall, the survey showed that military personnel had about the same inci› dence  of drug and alcohol  use  as  the civilian  population.  One notable  exception  was  the  much  greater  use  of amphetamines and other "uppers" among 18-25 year olds in  the military.

## Accident Prevention

For the first  time  in  two  years  several  types  of accidents  in the Army increased during this fiscal  year.  Army motor vehicle accidents increased slightly from  5,194  to  5,208,  although  the accident rate  decreased  from  5.1  to  4.8  per  one  million  miles traveled. Army Class A aviation accidents increased slightly from 37 last fiscal year to 43 in fiscal year 1981, and the Class A aviation rate rose slightly from 2.41 to 2.6 per 100,000 flying hours. The number of  destroyed aircraft increased from 31  to 36. Accidents in  privately owned vehicles increased from  1,860 to  1,863.

In  spite  of the  increased  accidents,  however,  fatalities  de› creased. This fiscal  ye,ir the Army experienced a  15-percent re› duction  in fatalities, from 549  to  466,  the  lowest  number recorded in many years. This was primarily the result of  an overall reduction in military personnel fatalities from 504 to 415, an 18percent  decline.  Deaths  in  Army  motor  vehicle  accidents  de› creased 27  percent, from  59  to  44.  Army aviation  fatalities  re› mained  at  26,  the  same  as  last  year. Deaths  resulting  from accidents in privately owned vehicles decreased from 292 to 287.

The Office of  the Director of  Army Safety served as the focal point  for  further  study  and  development  of the  Army Safety Program 5-10 Year Plan, parts of  which had been scheduled for implementation this year. The office also assumed responsibility for assisting the ODCSPER in studying chemical agents and re› lated munitions systems and for developing a radiation protection program throughout the Army to coordinate and resolve issues in occupational radiation exposure and related matters.

## Discipline, Law  Enforcement, and Military Justice

Discipline  in  the  Army  improved considerably over the last fiscal  year,  but progress  was  uneven,  with some areas reporting continued  problems.  Worldwide,  crimes  of violence  have  de-

creased  22  percent since  the end of fiscal  year  1974, and they decreased  4  percent in  the  past year.  Crimes  against  property have declined  13  percent since fiscal  year 1974, but increased 2 percent since fiscal  year 1980.  Marijuana use and possession has risen to an all-time high since  1974-10 percent higher than in 1974 and 26 percent higher than in 1980. Other drug offenses decreased  by  36  percent since  1974,  and  decreased  3  percent since  fiscal  year  1980.  AWOL  rates  have  dropped  59  percent since fiscal  year 197  4 and were down 13 percent during the past year. Desertions have dropped 61  percent since fiscal  year 1974 and registered a  19-percent decrease this year over 1980 levels. Total courts-martial were up 13 percent. Nonjudicial punishment was up 3 percent, and separations other than honorable were up 3  percent over fiscal  year  1980.

The breakdown of  court-martial statistics for fiscal  year 1981 is  as  follows:

|                             | Convicted   |   Acquitted | Total   |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| General............         | 1,262       |         164 | 1,426   |
| Special............ .       | 4,180*      |         414 | 4,594   |
| Summary...........          | 4,070       |         348 | 4,418   |
| Total . . . . .. . .. . . . | 9,512       |         926 | 10,438  |

·Jn 1,220 of  the ipecial court.martial cases, the approved sentence included a bad conduct ducharge. Also imposed during the year were  156.497  nonjudicial puni.shmeni, under Article  15,  Uniform Code of Military  Justice.

The indiscipline index at the following table provides a com› parison of quarterly  rates  for  offenses,  punishments, and sepa› rations less than honorable since the beginning of  fiscal year 1977.

Over the twelve-month  period ending 30 November  1980, 78,751 U.S. military and civilian personnel and their dependents were charged with  offenses within  the exclusive or primary ju› risdiction  of foreign  tribunals.  Of the offenses charged  against Army members, 14,625 were subject to the primary jurisdiction of foreign courts. The Army obtained waivers of  jurisdiction in 14,201 of these cases,  which amounted to a  waiver rate of 97.1 percent. Of U.S. personnel confined in foreign penal institutions during the twelve-month period, fifty-eight were Army person› nel, civilians, or dependents.

On 7 November 1980 the Army Chief of Staff  approved the permanent establishment of  the U .S: Army Trial Defense Service (USATDS),  a  separate organization  providing  military  defense counseling throughout the Army.  USATDS will  continue  to be organized as an activity of  the U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, a field operating agency of  The  Judge Advocate General. On 15

September 1981  the Army issued a change to Army Regulation 27-10, Military Justice,  providing regulatory authority  for USATDS. By  30 September 1981  approximately 215 judge ad› vocates  were assigned  to  USATDS  and were stationed in  field offices that serve all of the Army's commands.

During fiscal  year  1981  USATDS  continued  to  develop  its capability  to serve combat and combat support units.  USATDS counsel participated in many local field exercises, in deployment exercises  at  Fort  Irwin,  California,  and  in  a  major  REFORGER exercise with the 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions irtGermany. The new  organization  also  expanded  its  coordination  with  reserve units.  Reserve defense counsel teams performed their two-week active  duty  training  under  the  supervision  of Senior  Defense Counsel at ten posts throughout the continental United States.

On 15 September 1981  the Army published other important changes to Army Regulation 27-10: clarification of which  per› sonnel  records of a  convicted  soldier may  be  presented  to the military  judge before sentencing, and a provision for the detailing of  military  judges from another armed service. During fiscal year 1981  the Army also  conducted an extensive evaluation  of AR 27-10, with  an  eye  to  a  major  revision.  Major  changes  being considered deal  with  the administration  of nonjudicial  punish› ment and the inclusion of  records of  such punishment in a service member's  personnel file. The revision is expected to be published next fiscal  year.

Several amendments to the Manual  for Courts-Martial were put into effect by Executive Orders 12306 and 12315, signed on 1 June 1981 and 29 July 1981  respectively. The most significant change dealt with producing witnesses during the sentencing por› tion of  a court-martial. The change recognized that the require› ment for the personal appearance of  a witness during sentencing differed  substantially  from  when  the  testimony  of a  witness  is offered on the merits. This change allows evidence on sentencing to be produced through oral depositions, written interrogatories, and former testimony.

This fiscal  year the Joint Services Committee,  composed of representatives from all  the services, worked toward a complete revision  of the  Manual for  Courts-Martial.  The goal  is  to com› plete the revision  in  fiscal  year  1983.

On 14 May 1981, a bill was introduced in the Se~ate (S.  1181) which would amend the Uniform Code of  Military  Justice (UCMJ) to permit the general court-martial convening authority to place on involuntary excess leave those service members who have re› ceived a punitive discharge and are awaiting appellate review of

their court-martial; establish a  two-year statute of  ]imitations on petitions to The Judge Advocate General  for review  under Ar› ticle 69, UCMJ; allow service secretaries to define, by regulation, the reasonable availability of  individually requested military coun› sel;  as  well  as several  other changes.  At the close  of fiscal  year 1981, passage of the bill  was  imminent.

On 9 March  1981  the Army established the U.S.  Army Mil› itary Police Operations Agency (USAMPOA), a field operating agency under the staff  supervision of  the DCSPER, for one year pending the completion of an ODCSPER study to determine the best  organizational  structure  for  all  agencies  of Army  law  en› forcement.  The USAMPOA assumed  responsibility  for several functions formerly  performed by the ODSCPER Law  Enforce› ment Division, which has been renamed the Office of Army Law Enforcement. The mission  of the USAMPOA is  to monitor im› plementation of Army law  enforcement policy,  to  develop and promulgate military police operational and technical guidance, and to disseminate this guidance to other Army law enforcement elements.

## 7.  Support Services

The adage "an army travels on its stomach" is an apt reminder that a well-trained,  well-equipped, and well-led army may come to  naught  unless  the  physical  and  emotional  well-being  of the individual  soldier  is  also  taken  into  account.  Support services cover a  wide range of activities which  respond to  this need.

## Health and Medical Care

Army expenditures for  medical  services in  fiscal  year  1981 amounted to $2,016.2 million,  $368 million  more than for the preceding year. The increase was largely because of  military and civilian pay raises, the continuing escalation ofheaJth service costs for beneficiaries at both Army medical treatment facilities  and civilian facilities, a substantial jump in medical construction, and a  rise  in  medical  equipment purchases.  The table below shows Army medical  expenditures  by  appropriation  category  for  the last two fiscal  years (in  millions of dollars):

| Appropriation                             | FY 80   | FY81    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Military Personnel, Army...............   | 640.2   | 681.0   |
| Operations and.Maintenance, Army .....    | 828.0   | 999.0   |
| Research and Development, Army.......     | 91.5    | 90.0    |
| Military Construction, Army ......... ... | 20.3    | 158.4   |
| Other Procurement, Army .............     | 56.2    | 72.9    |
| Reserve Personnel, Army...............    | 12.0    | 14.3    |
| Total ...............................     | 1,648.2 | 2,015.6 |

The patient workload at Army medical care facilities did not reach programmed levels this year, although the actual workload exceeded fiscal year 1980 levels by a small margin. A larger work› load  would  have  been  attained  had  it  not  been  for  personnel shortages in  physician specialties and  medical support.  The av› erage length of  a hospital stay continued to decline-an average of 6.7 days in fiscal  year 1981  as  compared with 6.9 days in the previous  year.  The shorter stays  were offset by  a  I-percent in› crease  in  the  number  of hospital  admissions.  Both  factors  re› flected national health care trends toward same-day surgery and intensive care units  that promote shorter hospital  days.

The Army, along with the Navy, the Air Force, and the Uni-

formed  Services  University  for  the  Health Sciences  (USUHS), prepared to carry out a directive from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense  that  removed  restrictions on sickle-cell  trait  (SCT) sufferers,  which  had  disqualified  them  for  flying,  diving,  and parachuting duties.  The directive  also  required  the  services  to begin a  long-term check on service members with SCT to see if this policy change would have any adverse effects, and to institute mandatory testing  for  SCT and for glucose-6  phosphate dehy› drogenase  (G-6-PD).  A  USUHS-triservice  methodology  to monitor personnel with SCT during their careers was  progress= ing,  while  plans to test  all  service  members for  SCT and G-6PD were just getting under way as the fiscal  year ended.  In ad› dition, the Army was preparing to evaluate applicants for flying, diving, and high-altitude low-opening parachuting for increased susceptibility to hypoxia, dehydration, and physical stress-con› ditions that were believed to be related to morbidity and the  sickle cell trait.  The Army also considered studying SCT at Fort Bliss, where five of  seven Army trainee deaths occurred that may have been related to SCT.

Army Medical Department activities concerning health haz› ards  were  centered at the  U.S.  Army  Environmental  Hygiene Agency (USAEHA), a part of the Health Services Command. In 1981  USAEHA received the mission of validating health hazard assessment (HHA) efforts  for  nonmedical  materiel,  developing HHA standards and specifications, and acting as technical adviser on HHA matters to the office of the Surgeon General, the U.S. Army Medical  Research  and  Development Command, and de› velopers.  USAEHA was also responsible for developing the Ar› my's local  occupational  health  hazard inventory  (LOHHI) and served as the central repository for collected data. The LOHHI gave the Army information on hazardous operations and chem› icals  which  the Surgeon General needed in order to advise  the Secretary of Labor of potential  health  hazards  within  the  De› partment  of Defense,  information  to  help  physicians  develop medical surveillance programs, and data for use in educating and training service members and employees concerning work haz› ards.

Army insta1lations have had difficulties meeting their respon› sibilities  in  the  area  of occupational  health,  which  include job› related  medical  survei11ance  and  personnel  protection,  hazard identification  and  assessment,  prevention  and  control  of occu› pational diseases and injuries, and feeding data to the Department of the Army for consolidation and overall program evaluation. For the last several years the Army Medical Department has tried

to  resolve  problems  at  the  installation  level  by  developing  an automated occupational health management information system (OHMIS), but  has  lacked  the  necessary  resources  to  carry  it through.  Safety Sciences,  Inc.,  received  a  contract this  year  to conduct an OHMIS study.  The objective of the study is  to de› termine the best alternative system  for  assembling,  comparing, using, and evaluating personnel exposure information, baseline medical examination data, periodic medical surveillance data, oc› cupational  illness  and  injury  information,  workplace  environ› mental  monitoring data,  personal  protective equipment  usage, observations of work practices, and hazard awareness education. The study should be finished in the spring of 1982.

Army Nurse Corps (ANC) strength at the end of the fiscal year  was  near  authorized  levels,  3,833  on  hand  compared  to 3,859 authorized; however, it was not enough to meet require› ments. So,  2,162 civilian registered nurses were employed as of 30 ~eptember 1981  to help meet the need for nursing care and services.

In fiscal year 1981 Army nurses participated in a wide variety of Army  and  civilian  educational  programs  to  promote  their professional  development.  The goal  of achieving an all-prof  es› sional corps moved forward with 98 percent of all ANC officers holding baccalaureate degrees.

The Army Medical Specialist Corps (AMSC) expanded its sup› port of  the annual REFORGER exercise as two field grade officers, a  physical  therapist  and a  dietitian,  took  an  active  role  in  RE› FORGER 1981. The physical therapist worked at a division clearing station and provided both musculoskeletal evaluations and acute patient care. This was the first time in the REFORGER series that a  physical  therapist  had  been  in  such  a  forward  position.  The second officer served as chief dietitian to the 85th Combat Sup› port Hospital.

Dietitians also served with the 5th Combat Support Hospital at Fort Bragg,  North Carolina, during Operation BOLD  EAGLE and assisted the 44th Medical  Brigade in support of the Rapid Deployment Force. The dietitian assigned to the 44th developed a  "quick-fix"  hospital  B-ration  and  subsequently  collaborated with  a  dietitian  from  the  Hospital  Food Service  Branch of the Academy of Health  Sciences and  with  Natick  Laboratories  to develop a  new ten-day,  hospital B-ration.

As noted in last year's historical summary, the  1980 Depart› ment of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act provided for sharp reductions in DOD veterinary activities and their consolidation within  the  Army over a  five-year  period.  The  1981  DOD  Ap-

propriations Act shortened the consolidation time to three years, ending in  fiscal  year  1983.  Consolidation actions taken as  of 30 September  1981  included a  IO-percent reduction in  DOD vet› erinary officer positions;  disestablishment of the Air Force Vet› erinary Service; execution of memoranda of understanding and interservice  support agreements  with  the  Navy  and  Air  Force; identification of  veterinary officer research and development po› sitions  that could be filled  by civilians;  and, as  discussed  below, development of a  warrant officer program in  food  inspection.

A particularly noteworthy accomplishment resulting from the consolidation  was  the  creation  of a  food  inspection  technician warrant officer specialty (MOSC  051A).  This action satisfied a congressional  requirement  to  replace  30  percent of veterinary officers  who  perform food  inspection functions with  other spe› cialists.  The first  increment of ten warrant officers was selected in July  1981.  Their training  in  the  new  specialty  will  begin  in November 1981  at the Academy of Health Sciences.  A  total of fifty-three warrant officers will  replace veterinary officers as op› erational managers of  food inspection functions and will provide day-to-day guidance to noncommissioned officers and specialists who actually perform the inspections. Veterinary Corps officers will serve as consultants to the Surgeon General, warrant officers, noncommissioned  officers,  and  specialists  for  food  inspection matters. Because of  the diverse functions of  veterinarians, further substitution would  not be advisable.

One aspect  of veterinary  services  consolidation  which  the Army considered harmful has to do with a provision of the 1980 DOD Appropriations Act calling  for  the civilianization  of vet› erinary positions involved in  research and development "to the maximum extent possible  without jeopardizing legitimate  mili› tary  requirements."  Approximately  one-third  of all  veterinary officers were engaged in biomedical and subsistence research for the military. Military veterinary scientists had made valuable con› tributions to the understanding of  such diseases as leptospirosis, meliodosis, viral encephalitis, malaria, scrub typhus, radiation ill› ness and protection, and the development and improvement of surgical prostheses.

Lt. Gen. Charles C. Pixley, the Surgeon General of  the Army, opposed civilianization.  He pressed his case  when the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs directed a  reduction of 102  military  veterinary  research  and  development positions  to comply  with  the  civilianization  proviso  contained  in  the  1980 DOD Appropriations Act.

On 8 July 1981, William D. Clark, Principal Deputy Assistant

Secretary of  the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, hosted a  meeting attended by General Pixley; John F.  Beary, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs; Brig. Gen.  Garrison  Rapmund,  Assistant  Surgeon  General  for  Re› search and Development; Brig. Gen. Frank A. Ramsey, Chief of the Veterinary  Corps;  and  others from  the offices of Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Health Affairs and  the Assistant Sec› retary of  the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. The pur› pose of the meeting was to seek a solution to the problems posed by civilianization.  Participants at  the  meeting  pointed  out  the critical  need for veterinary specialists to support essential DOD research and development programs; the inability to hire civilians to replace  I  02 military veterinarians; the adverse effect such re› placement would have on the morale of the 102 incumbent mil› itary  research  veterinarians,  who  would  lose  their  job  space authorizations, and the inevitable attrition of  these officers unless space authorizations were restored; and the serious jeopardy to existing and forthcoming programs which would result.

After the meeting the Army sent a  memorandum to the As› sistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs detailing the sit› uation  and requesting  the restoration of the  102  spaces to the Veterinary Corps. These would be withdrawn one year after the completion of the consolidation of DOD veterinary services, but only as positions were successfully turned over to civilians.  The Assistant Secretary had not responded to the memorandum by 30 September 1981.

At the close of fiscal  year  1981  the Health Facility  Modern› ization  Program  had  thirty-three  projects  under  construction (twelve hospitals, four dental clinics, six health clinics, and nine health and dental clinics).  The value of the projects totaled just under $350.4 million.

Work began on fourteen medical construction projects during the year: eight in Europe, two in the Pacific region, and four in the continental United States. The projects in Europe comprised health and dental clinics at Amberg, Bad Hershfeld, Butzbach, Mannheim, and Wertheim; health clinics at Fulda and Illesheim; and a dental clinic at Heidelberg. The two projects in the Pacific were additions and renovations to Tripler Army Medical Center in  Hawaii  and to a  dental  clinic at Yongsan,  Korea.  Projects  in the continental United States involved site work at the new Fort Carson hospital and construction at the Hunter-Ligget health and dental clinic, the Fort Sam Houston troop medical clinic, and the Fort Belvoir health clinic.

The Army completed fifteen  medical  construction projects

during fiscal year 1981: dental clinics at West Point and at Forts Bliss, Bragg, Knox, Lee, Ord, Polk, Riley, Sam Houston, and Sill; and,  in  Germany, health clinics at Baumholder,  Karlsruhe, and Schwaebisch Gemuend and health and dental clinics at Bindlach and Mainz.

The Army obtained one hospital  and one  clinic,  following either the closing or the conversion to the  local  community of eight  U.S.  Public  Health Service (PHS) hospitals  and  twenty› seven PHS clinics. The clinic, which is located in St.  Louis, Mis› souri, should eliminate the need to build a new clinic in Granite City, Illinois. Letterman Army Medical Center will use the former PHS hospital in San Francisco to satisfy both building space re› quirements and shortages of mobilization hospital beds.

## Religion

From the American Revolution to the  present, during war› time as well  as periods of  peace, Army chaplains have tended to the spiritual and moral needs of  the military community. Chaplain activities during fiscal year 1981  had two primary thrusts: soldier support and professional development. Soldier support dealt with the many programs and services directed toward service members and their families.  Professional development involved programs and activities to sharpen the skills  of Army chaplains and those working with them in performing their duties.

The  rapid  growth  of chaplain-operated  family  life  centers continued  during  fiscal  year  1981.  Two  training  seminars  for center directors were  held  during  the  year.  The first,  a  week› long event held  in  Kansas,  trained  thirty-eight chaplains in the use  of a  new  program designed  to  build family  understanding and community cohesion and support. The second event, which took place at the Menninger Clinic, gave twenty-two chaplains a one-week refresher course and update on family ministry.

As a follow-up  to the 14-16 November 1979 meeting of the Family Life Steering  Committee held in Rosslyn, Virginia, a select group of chaplains  and  other concerned  persons  assembled at Colo'.ado Springs, Colorado,  in  April  1980  to discuss new  ways to  train  chaplains  for  family  life  ministry.  The  group  recom› mended a program in which four graduate school students would participate in a supervised practicum at a major installation.  The concept  was  accepted  by  the  Chief of Chaplains  in  May  1981. Fort Knox  was  selected as  the  training site  for  a  two-year  test program that will  begin in fiscal  year  1982.

Army chaplains met with principal planners of the first Army

Family Symposium early in fiscal  year  1981  to share their con› cerns regarding marriage and family life. The exchange of  views led  to  several  program  changes,  chaplain  presentations  at  the symposium, and increased  awareness of family-related  chaplain programs. Chaplains gave strong support for  the second  Army Family Symposium, which will be held in fiscal  year 1982.

The use of audiovisual materials to implement chaplain pro› grams  has  been  hampered  by  a  moratorium  on  new  film  pur› chases.  The  ban  does  not  affect  related  activities,  such  as gathering materials and script ideas, coordinating ideas for future films, publicity, script  approval, preproduction meetings, and film festival participation,  which  have  continued  with  minimal  ex› penditure of  chaplain funds. One film produced before the mor› atorium was distributed during the year and six more were almost ready for release. One of these was awarded a silver medal at the New York International Film Festival.

Several actions  were taken during the year in  regard to re› ligious education programs and curricula.  Multiethnic religious education workshops were held at Hampton Institute, Virginia, and San Anselmo Seminary, California, at which new resources, methods,  and skills  were identified  and developed.  Pilot work› shops at the Presbyterian School  of Christian Education,  Rich› mond,  Virginia,  and  at  the  Interdenominational  Theological Center,  Atlanta,  Georgia,  proved  most  beneficial  to  attending chapel activities specialists, directors of  religious education, chap› lains,  and laity  in  developing practical help  to fulfill  their roles as teachers and leaders in  Protestant religious education. In ad› dition, a revision of  the Unified  Jewish Curriculum  was completed and distributed;  development  of a  new Jewish  curriculum  was well  under way and should be completed in fiscal  year 1982.

The 1981  Minority Ministries Training Course, held in  At› lanta,  Georgia,  between  26  April and  1  May  1981,  focused  on ways both to help chaplains identify multicultural and multiethnic problems and to minister to them. Coretta Scott King, widow of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., was the keynote speaker.

Army  chaplains  relied  more  on  internal  resources  in  con› ducting parish development training workshops this year, as fund› ing for outside civilian consultants was  phased out. Twenty-one persons completed the first  Parish Development Training Pro› gram,  which  was  designed and directed entirely  by chaplaincy personnel. The nine-month course covered a broad spectrum of theory and "back-home" projects designed to better equip chap› lains, chapel activities specialists,  and directors of religious edu› cation  for  performance  of  leadership  roles  in  such  areas  as

training  for  the  parish  ministry,  consulting,  parish council  and lay  activities, transition sessions, and conflict  management.

Several actions were taken during fiscal year 1981  to improve job satisfaction within  the chaplaincy.  On the recommendation of the Chief of  Chaplains and following coordination with  USA› REUR,  FORSCOM,  TRADOC,  and  DARCOM,  the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel approved changes in  Army regula› tions to permit unmarried chaplains to compete for family hous› ing on the same basis as those who were married. This action has improved the retention rate of  Catholic chaplains and has served to ameliorate the severe shortage of Catholic priests in the chap› laincy; only 289 out of a desired level of 506 were in service.

Two initiatives taken during the year were aimed at  improving the status of chapel activities specialists.  The E-9 staff sergeant major position at the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School was upgraded  to  command sergeant  major  in  May  1981.  Further› more,  beginning on  31  July,  a  chapel  activities  supervisor was detailed to the U.S. Army Military Personnel Center (MILPER› CEN) to provide liaison between the Office of  the Chief  of  Chap› lains and MILPERCEN and to ensure that the needs of chapel activities specialists and the Chaplain Branch were met.

Katcoff v. Marsh, a civil suit filed on 23 November 1979 charg› ing  that  the  U.S.  Army  Chaplaincy  violates  the  establishment clause  of the  First  Amendment  of the  U.S.  Constitution,  re› mained in the discovery stage of litigation at the close  of fiscal year 1981. The plaintiffs propounded 123 interrogatories, ques› tioning virtually all  aspects of the chaplaincy.  Army lawyers  re› sponded to the questions and submitted several interrogatories of their own,  which  the plaintiffs answered.  The plaintiffs also turned in  137 requests for admissions. The Army replied on 31 July  1981.

## Casualty and Memorial Affairs

Army morticians overseas processed the remains of  685 bod› ies at six Army-operated mortuaries, while within the continental United States private  mortuaries working under contracts with the  Army  handled  the  remains of 1,176 active  duty  personnel and  their  dependents.  The Army's mortuary workload  during fiscal  year  1981  numbered  1,861  deceased persons.  A  Seventh Army  mortuary  recovered  and  identified  the  remains  of one World War II soldier.

The Central Identification  Laboratory in  Hawaii  identified the remains of repatriated Navy and  Air Force personnel.  The

laboratory  recovered  10  I  remains  during search and  recovery missions  to  New Guinea, Wake Island, Tarawa, the Philippines, Enewetak, and Peleliu. Of  these, nine were individually identified as  U.S.  World War II casualties.

The Concepts Analysis  Agency (CAA) conducted a study of the Army's capability  to handle personnel  killed  in  combat for the Troop Support Division, Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff for  Logistics  (ODCSLOG).  The study addressed  the mortuary affairs management structure during both peacetime and maj or military  operations.  The study  uncovered  severe  limitations  in the Army's ability to provide graves registration support as  well as  training  inadequacies  in  cemetery  operations,  mass  casualty burial  procedures,  and  operations  in  a  nuclear,  biological,  or chemical environment. The study concluded that the mortuary affairs management structure lacked functional integrity and suf› fered  from  multiple sources of guidance, staff supervision, and technical support. Representatives from the ODCSLOG, the Lo› gistics Center, and the Quartermaster School have developed a plan  that deals  with  the problems noted  in  the  CAA study,  in support of which a program development increment package for fiscal years 1984-1988 has been prepared. Requested funds cover costs for training, force structure, and equipment that are needed to support a  minimal effort.

The Columbarium for cremated remains was  dedicated in Arlington  National  Cemetery on  26  April  1980, and  the  first inurnment took place two days  later.  As of 30 September 1981, the remains of  846 bodies had been inurned, an average of  about seventy per month. Ground burials in Arlington and Soldiers and Airmens Home National Cemeteries numbered 2,823 for fiscal year  1981.

During fiscal year 1981 the Casualty Services Division of  The Adjutant  General's Center  processed  994  active  duty  deaths; 6,078 retiree deaths;  185 deaths of service  members who died within  120 days of separation, discharge, or retirement; and an estimated 450 cases involving seriously ill and very seriously ill individuals  in  overseas  commands.  The  division  also  handled 741,000 records of emergency data.

## Housing and Homeowners' Assistance

After a one-year delay caused by Office of Management and Budget (0MB) action, the new family housing construction pro› gram made rapid headway.  Contracts totaling  $47.699 million were awarded for 900 family units-500 at Fort Ord, California;

200 at Fort Polk,  Louisiana; and 200 at Fort Stewart,  Georgia. One-half of the Fort Stewart units will  be smaller than the stan› dard two-bedroom units (750 square feet of living space as com› pared with 950 square feet) and will be used by soldiers in grade E-4 with less than two year's  service or by soldiers in lower grades who  have  dependents.  Heretofore these  lower-ranking enlisted members could get family  housing only if there was a surplus.

Activity in the Family Housing Maintenance, Repair, and Im› provement (MRI) Program picked up during the year.  The En› ergy Conservation  Investment  Program,  one of two  programs eliminated  by  the  Office  of Management  and  Budget in  fiscal year 1980, was  restored, and several projects valued at $27.150 million  were  undertaken.  The  Minor  Construction  Program, which 0MB also axed last year, was not restored. Work continued on four projects under the Line Item Improvement program with a  total  cost  of $8.14  7  million;  on  one  Productivity  Enhancing Capital  Investment  Program project funded at $5.139  million; and on  the  Maintenance and Repair program,  which  received $215.338 million  in  funding for fiscal  year 1981.

Acting on  a  request made by  Lt.  Gen.  Marion  C.  Ross,  the Deputy  Commander  of FORSCOM,  General John  W.  Vessey, Army Vice Chief of Staff, approved the reestablishment of the Army Housing Committee (ARHOC) in March 1981. The com› mittee,  which  comprised  a  steering committee and  a  working group,  reviewed  policies,  goals,  and  objectives for  housing un› accompanied enlisted personnel and assessed the adequacy of  new and modernized facilities in meeting Army requirements. During the late spring  and  summer of 1981 ARHOC discussions centered on conflicts between guidelines emanating from the VOLAR ex› periment in  the early  1970s and on current needs  for  unit in› tegrity,  cohesion,  command  and  control,  discipline,  and readiness.  The committee firmly  rejected a  return to open bays or squad bays.  By mid-August, after consulting with TRADOC, FORSCOM, and various Army staff elements, it had developed broad criteria  for  barracks design  that included  (1)  removal  of E-7s and above as a "unit barracks" consideration; (2) increased barracks room size  from  270  to 400 square feet;  (3)  two  E-6s, three E-5s, and four E-4s and below to a room; (4) a bathroom with shower and tub combination for each room;  (5)  company day  rooms  to replace  lounges;  (6)  return  of company  adminis› tration and supply to the barracks; and (7)  maintenance of unit integrity at the battalion level and, wherever possible, at the com› pany level.  At year's end the Office of the Chief of Engineers was preparing architectural designs and drawings incorporating

the criteria. These designs will be reviewed by the ARHOC steer› ing committee upon completion. The committee will then submit recommendations and design proposals to the Vice Chief  of  Staff.

Passage of  the Military Pay and Allowance Act of  1980 (Public Law 96-579) granted service members in the grades of E-7 and above without dependents the right to elect to receive basic al› lowance for  quarters (BAQ)  rather  than to live  in  government quarters.  This  right had  previously  been  limited  to  O-4s and above.  Installation commanders may deny service members the right to elect BAQ only if such a choice would have a significant adverse effect on operational  requirements,  unit discipline,  law and  order of the  installation,  health  and  safety  requirements, protection  of government  property,  or other areas of military discipline or readiness.

Administration  proposals  to  terminate  the  Family  Housing Domestic Leasing Program posed a hardship on service members who could face eviction from  leased quarters before completion of their normal three-year tour. The Vice Chief of  Staff and the Assistant Secretary of  the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) sought and won  relief from the Office of the Secretary of De› fense. As a result, the Family Housing Domestic Leasing Program will  be phased out on an orderly basis  by  the end of fiscal  year 1983.  Because of this  additional  time,  service  families  will  not have  to be evicted from current leases.

As  executive agent  for  all  military  services,  the  Army  paid $1.6 million  under the Homeowners Assistance Program to 219 applicants  in  fiscal  year  1981  as  a  result  of base  closures and realignment actions. Mortgage assumptions on eleven properties acquired during the period totaled $317,000.

Work  progressed on the Housing Operations Management System (HOMES), which was described in last year's report. The Office  of the  Chief of Engineers submitted a  mission  element needs statement for approval, and funds  to develop and deploy HOMES were programmed for fiscal  years  1982 and  1983. In other actions,  the  Major  Command  Housing Automated  Data Processing  Advisory  Committee  was  established  to  review  the development  of housing  standard  operating  procedures  and housing  automated systems,  and  the  U.S.  Army  Construction Engineering  Research  Laboratory conducted workshops  to  re› view standard procedures for the family housing assignment and terminations and housing referral functions.

In December 1980, the Army published its first comprehen› sive housing management training plan. The number of  centrally funded intern spaces was increased from  eighteen  in fiscal  year

1980 to twenty-four in 1981. Three intern spaces were allocated for on-site training in Europe. At its 17-19 November 1980 meet› ing, the Housing Management Career Program Screening Panel reviewed  the  records  of 252  careerists.  During  the  year,  243 careerists were processed for overseas assignments and 176 were processed for  duties within  the continental  United States.  The permanent format of  the Housing Management Career Appraisal and Individual Development Plan was completed, as was the draft of a  new  Army  regulation  covering the  Housing  Management Career Program.

## Food Services

At the close of fiscal  year  1981,  1,072 dining facilities  were in  operation  worldwide (655  in  CONUS and 417  overseas).  Of these,  nine were free-standing specialty or short-order facilities, and  five  were  officers' field-ration  dining facilities.  During the year,  230,746,000  meals  were  served,  valued  at $271  million. The one garrison bread bakery  in  Berlin  and  the  one  central pastry  kitchen  at  Aberdeen  Proving Ground continued  to  op› erate.

The Dining Facility Modernization Program, initiated in fiscal year  1975 and revitalized in  fiscal  year  1980, provides modern equipment for preparation, serving lines to support regular and short-order or specialty  menus,  properly  equipped  self-service areas,  and  a  contemporary  dining  environment.  Major  Army commands have identified 221  dining facilities that require mod› ernization  at  a  cost  of $183  million  during  fiscal  years  19831987. The Program Budget Committee approved $10 million to modernize thirteen dining facilities in fiscal  year 1983. The re› mainder of the needed funds  is  included  in  the  Dining Facility Modernization  Program  Development  Increment  Package (PDIP).

Based  on a  major  study  by  the  Troop Support Agency  of dining facility  staffing  requirements,  the staffing guide  for  the facilities was significantly changed in August 1981. The need for more  cooks  and  administrative  personnel  was  recognized.  In› creases of up to  45  percent were  authorized  for  facilities  with extended operating hours and extensive field service and for dual serving lines; the need for an additional 25-percent increase was recognized  for  continuous,  full-service  operations.  This  repre› sented an important step toward solving the dining facility staff› ing problem.

The fiscal  year  1981  Military Construction, Army, program

included the modernization of two dining facilities (one at Fort Lewis,  Washington,  and  one  in  Korea)  at a  cost  of $699,000. There were no new dining facilities  approved for construction in  the fiscal  year  1981  program.

Development of the Combat Field Feeding System (CFFS) by the  Natick  Research  and  Development  Laboratories  (NLABS) and  U.S.  Army Training and  Doctrine  Command (TRADOC) continued  with  considerable  support  from  the  Troop Support Agency  (TSA).  CFFS  will  be  a  company-level  kitchen  (tactical field kitchen) capable of  operating from a prime mover or trailer. The basic  ration  for  the  kitchen  will  be  the  T-ration,  a  shelf› stable,  fully  prepared,  heat-and-serve  product.  The  CFFS  will provide a  hot meal  to small  groups,  squad-sized  units,  or com› panies, and when consolidated it can feed  battalion-sized  units. On  15  December  1980,  the  Vice  Chief of Staff of the  Army approved the CFFS for  further development.  The DA Subsist› ence Review Committee examined the CFFS in February 1981 and provided implementation guidance. The Outline Test Plan, completed on 5  March  1981, specified a  28-day battalion-sized FDTE (force development test and experimentation) test of the CFFS for October 1982. This test will  be a  major factor in de› termining whether or not the system will  be accepted.  A  letter of agreement between TRADOC and DARCOM for the devel› opment of the CFFS was  signed on 13  March  1981  and subse› quently  amended  to  provide  for  HQDA  in-process  review approval.

An in-process review in March 1981 determined that the Au› tomated Bakery System (ABS), another Natick Laboratories proj› ect, did not meet the needs of the Army for the late 1980s, and efforts  to  field  the system  were stopped.  Actions in  support of the field bakery will now be directed toward finding new technical approaches, developing canned bread, and upgrading the present M-1945 Field Bakery.

Two  of the  numerous,  ongoing  food  service  research  and development projects have Armywide significance. The first proj› ect deals  with  a  method for determining quality  standards for food  and  food  services  operating  under commercial  contracts. To date, Natick Food Engineering Laboratories has surveyed the quality assurance practices of twenty-two nonmilitary hospitals, emphasizing methods and procedures used to measure the final food product and food service quality. Four food service contract companies were also contacted for information on their quality assurance programs. Based on survey results, a prototype quality

assurance and evaluation program will  be developed that can be monitored by government personnel.

The second project of  significance is a revision of  the hospital B-ration menu to include components of both existing and new shelf-stable foods for  use in a  field environment without refrig› eration. Natick  Laboratories is  developing recipes for a  ten-day menu based on both the Army's ten-day plan and diet require› ments for the 1990s.

The first  U.S.  Army hospital food service contract has been developed for  application  to  Fitzsimons  Army Medical  Center; bids are currently under review. This action will be closely mon› itored as a feasibility test for contracting out Army hospital food service operations. Clinical  dietitians  will  remain military to en› sure that mobilization  requirements are met.

During fiscal  year  1981,  five  Food  Management Assistance Teams of the Troop  Support Agency  provided  dining  facility management and technical assistance to ac:tive Army and reserve component commands and installations and food service person› nel  worldwide.  The teams visited  fifty-seven  active  Army com› mands  and  installations,  including  lengthy  stays  at  Germany, Hawaii, Alaska,  Puerto Rico, and the Far East. They toured 511 dining  facilities  and  contacted  and  assisted  7,267  food  service personnel. A total of  223 reserve component dining facilities and 1,580 food  service  personnel at separate brigades and armored cavalry regiments in eighteen states were assisted.

The Army Food Management Information System (AFMIS) is  an  automated  system  for  controlling the  head  count,  dining facility,  and troop issue  subsistence elements of the Army  food program. The system is  being developed as a  totally integrated Class  Ill system  in  accordance  with  prescribed Army  life  cycle management policies and procedures. The Office of  the Assistant Secretary  of the  Army  (Installations,  Logistics,  and  Financial Management) approved the mission element needs statement on 9  September 1981.  Developmental  work  was  then  initiated on the AFMIS product manager charter, the functional description, and the economic analysis.

## Commissary and Subsistence Supplies

At the end of fiscal year 1981, 72 domestic commissaries and 7 annexes were operating within the fifty states and Puerto Rico. There were also 70 foreign stores and 27 annexes in operation. A new store opened at Fort Irwin, California; new annexes began operations at Fischbach, Germany, and Camps Casey,  Edwards,

and Stanley in  South  Korea. Plans moved forward  for opening new stores in Cairo, Egypt, and a new annex at Kirchgoens, West Germany.

Significant  progress  has  been  made  during  the  past  three years  in  reducing  commissary  losses.  At the  end of fiscal  year 1978, 68 of 141  Army commissaries reported "out-of-tolerance" grocery losses, with the worldwide average loss set at 1. 3 percent of sales.  By  the end of fiscal  year  1981  only  33 stores had out› of-tolerance grocery losses,  and the worldwide average grocery loss  was  down  to  .52  percent  of sales.  A  significant  factor  in reducing losses has been the Command Inspection Program. It will be supplanted in fiscal year 1982 by inspections of  the Troop Support Command Inspector General.

In compliance with Office Management and Budget Circular A-76, the Army initiated cost studies at the commissaries at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. Conversion to contract will occur only if the cost study indicates an advantage to the government that is equal to at least  10 per› cent of personnel-related costs. Commissary food prices will  not be affected.

Participation of commissaries in the Department of Agricul› ture's  special supplemental food program for women, infants, and children increased significantly during fiscal  year 1981. Twenty› eight commissaries in thirteen states were involved.  Food sales per month under the program averaged $17,526 for each store.

The Automated Commissary Computer Entry Store System (ACCESS) underwent two pilot tests and a demonstration during the year.  The contractor's product did not meet requirements, and alternative plans were being considered. The test of  scanning equipment at the Fort Lee,  Virginia, commissary in September 1981 has, thus far, won favorable comment from both customers and cashiers.  A six-month evaluation of the application of scan› ning  devices  will be  conducted  before  a  decision  is  made  on whether to expand their use to other commissaries.

In the area of subsistence,  contractors completed deliveries of  two million cases of  meal ready-to-eat (MRE) rations in August 1981. This included shipments of annual replacement stocks to Europe  and  Korea.  The  Defense  Personnel  Support  Center awarded contracts for  four  million additional cases of these ra› tions, with delivery scheduled from January to December 1982.

The Subsistence Review Committee (SRC) was created in late 1971 to improve the Army's  food program. Committee meetings in recent years have been limited to establishing priorities for the Army commissary construction program. To achieve improved

control over the commissary system and other important areas of the  food  program,  the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Logistics (DCSLOG) expanded the scope of  the committee to include mon› itoring and reviewing major ongoing projects as well  as critical problem areas in food service, subsistence supply, and commissary operations and helping the DCSLOG to resolve matters requiring a  major effort at Department of the Army level.

The Academy of Health Sciences (AHS) hosted a conference on subsistence management in a chemical-biological-radiological (CBR) environment in  late January  1981.  Conferees concluded that a workable subsistence management system could probal;&gt;ly function using existing capabilities with  no significant loss of in› dividual  or  unit  effectiveness  resulting  from  contamination  of subsistence by CBR agents. Following the conference, the acad› emy distributed a draft concept for the care of  subsistence prod› ucts  threatened by  CBR agents,  which  was  being reviewed  by interested agencies as  the fiscal year ended.

## Laundry and Dry Cleaning

Field laundry and bath operations received considerable at› tention during the year. A plan of  action to identify and overcome shortcomings  was  adopted,  and  milestones  were  established  to ensure timely completion of the task.

The practice  of providing  laundry  bundle  support  was  re› viewed. The major Army commands responding wanted to con› tinue  or  expand  this  service.  Standardized  pricing  was  also considered, with mixed results received from major Army com› mands. A decision will  be made early in  1982 whether or not to continue this program.

## Clothing and Personal Equipment

The Army took several initiatives in fiscal year 1981 involving uniforms. Black shoulder marks were approved for wear by en› listed personnel in grade of corporal and higher; a maroon beret was authorized for wear by soldiers in airborne units; black braid was added to female officers' green slacks; a black pullover wool sweater, approved last year, was fielded; a maternity uniform shirt was approved; and washable Army-green trousers with washable braid were approved.

The Army terminated the policy  of granting exceptions  to appearance  standards  based  on  religious  beliefs  for  wearing beards, unshorn hair, turbans, or religious jewelry. This change

followed a review of  the effect of  these exceptions on the soldier's mission,  health,  and  safety.  Soldiers  already  in  the  Army  may continue to enjoy the previously granted exceptions as  long as they are otherwise eligible for service.

The temperate camouflage battle dress uniform (BDU)  will be introduced as the Army's field-garrison uniform on 1 October 1981. The BDU has a wood (forestlike) color pattern, is infrared reflective,  has  reinforced  elbows,  knees,  and seat,  and is  made with fabric that is  50-percent cotton and 50-percent nylon. The BDU includes a coat, hat, and trousers and represents the second phase  of a  multistage  transition  to  all-camouflaged  individual clothing and equipment. The first stage was the introduction of the desert camouflage BDU as an organizational item. It will be used mainly by the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) in a  desert environment.  During fiscal  year  1981  the RDF was  completely outfitted in both day and night editions of the desert BDU.

Both the temperate and desert BDUs are part of the Army's Battle  Dress  System  (BDS).  This system  includes  three camou› flage uniforms which will allow the Army to operate in temperate, desert, and arctic  environments.  Conversion to this system  will require  the  modification  of many  existing  items  of individual clothing and equipment as well as the introduction of new items.

C.A.C.I. Inc.-Federal received a contract in September 1981 to examine existing  Army  personal-organizational clothing and individual  equipment  management  procedures  and  to  recom› mend  a  more  cost-effective  way  of doing  business.  The study should be completed by  rnid-1982.  A  study advisory group has been established to monitor the contractor's progress, clarify re› quirements, and supply guidance.

## Heraldic Activities

The Institute of Heraldry continued to provide heraldic ser› vices for the armed forces and other government agencies during fiscal  year 1981. The emphasis of this year's work, however, was on Army items. These included the design and development of the  Army  Achievement  Medal,  Noncommissioned  Officers Professional  Development  Ribbon,  Army  Service  Ribbon,  and Overseas Service Ribbon. To meet the needs of  Army units, 158 distinctive unit insignia and 28 shoulder-sleeve insignia were de› signed and developed during this period. In the area of  research, the institute is continuing its program of evaluating various ma› terials and methods of manufacturing flags in  order to provide alternative,  less  costly  items  and  to  broaden  the  procurement

base. The following statistics reflect, in part, the accomplishments of  the institute: design of  510 items; completion of  1830 paintings and drawings and 174 sculptured items (molds, models, and casts); development  of  130  items-some  new  and  some  modified› which were placed in the procurement system; and inspection of 134,508  items  under  the  optional-purchase  quality-control  sys› tem during visits  to fifty-five  posts and  base  exchanges.  In  ad› dition the  institute performed  1,750  research and engineering support actions to assist the Defense Personnel Support Center.

## 8.  Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

Since 1968, when the Army National Guard (ARNG) and the Army  Reserve  (USAR)  completed their last  major  reorganiza› tion, annual changes in  the reserve components force structure have  been  kept  to a  minimum consistent  with  Total  Army  re› quirements to reduce personnel turbulence and, concomitantly, improve unit readiness. During fiscal year 1981 Forces Command activated 29 units in the reserve components, inactivated 24 units, reorganized 7  4  units, and relocated 3  7  units.

The Army  National  Guard added a  fourth TOW light an› tiarmor battalion to its structure and consolidated existing com› bat and combat support elements in the Kentucky ARNG to form an additional separate armor brigade. In other actions the ARNG converted two engineer companies from float bridge to assault float  bridge,  added  a  chemical  company  (nuclear,  biological, chemical  defense)  to  the  structure  of both  the  50th  Armored Division and the 49th Armored Division, and activated a combat support aviation company as part of the 29th Infantry Brigade. Other activations included a medical group headquarters, a med› ical clearing company, and a medical detachment; an ammunition group headquarters, two ordnance battalion headquarters, four ammunition companies, and four maintenance companies; and a transportation company and seven transportation detachments.

As a  result of Public Law  96-600, which  authorized Guam to  have  a  national  guard, an  ARNG  headquarters element for the  Territory of Guam  was  organized on  21  July  1981.  It will serve as  the nucleus for organizing a  combat support battalion headquarters, a  medical  company, a  signal company, a  military police company, and two engineer detachments.

Plans moved forward to improve the ARNG's military intel› ligence structure,  which  Congress had determined  was  ineffec› tive. FORSCOM developed a plan for the activation of 18 combat electronic warfare intelligence (CEWI) units (8 battalions and l 0 companies) beginning in  fiscal  year 1982 to support the ARNG's 8 combat divisions and 10 separate brigades.

Major units in the Army National Guard as of 30 September 1981  are shown below:

- 5  Jnfantry divisions
- I Infantry division  (mechanized)
- 2  Armored divisions
- l O  Infantry brigades (separate)
- 8  Infantry brigades (mechanized) (separate}
- 4 Armored brigades (separnte)
- 3 Medical brigades
- 4  Armored cavalry regiments
- 2  Special forces groups
- 1  Infantry group (arctic reconnaissance)
- 131 Separnte comba1  and combat support battalions
- 18  Hospitals
- 761 Separate companies and detachments
- 337  Separate headquarters

A  forward  element of the  Army  Reserve's 412th  Engineer Command consisting of  twenty-three inactive duty training  spaces was  established at Mannheim,  Germany, on 15  May  1981. The Army Reserve plans to establish additional forward elements in Europe to perform planning, coordination, and liaison duties be› tween  their parent  units  and  USAREUR  units with which  the reserve  units  would  serve  upon  mobilization  and  deployment. Plans were also being developed to locate independent forward deployment USAR units to Europe.

TRADOC, FORSCOM, and the Army staff continued work on the realignment of the  twelve  USAR training divisions and the 5th Training Brigade. This action followed a  determination that the existing structure was  not responsive  to either current training workloads or training base expansion, that it included nontrainers and installation support positions, and that there was little standardization among units in terms of functions and train› ing support. Actions were under way to correct these deficiencies. Positions have been packaged into several categories-trainers, immediate training support, immediate base support, peacetime› only requirements, and elements which  would not mobilize with the  divisions.  All  purely peacetime  requirements  will  be docu› mented on a TDA (table of distribution and allowance) augmen› tation  to  the divisional  MTOE (modified  table of organization and  equipment) so  that training division  MTOEs  will  be  more standardized. Immediate training and base support positions will be noted and listed on a divisional  MTOE. Bands will  be given an independent MTOE, and aviation sections will have their own TDA.

At the close of the fiscal  year the Army Reserve troop basis contained approximately 3,250 company- and detachment-sized units.  Major organizations in  the structure were as follows:

- 19  USA  reserve commands
- 12 Divisions (training)
- 2 Maneuver area commands
- 2  Engineer commands
- 1 Military police command
- 2  Theater army area commands (TAACOM)
- 3 Civil affairs commands
- 2  Corps support commands (COSCOM)
- 3 General hospital commands
- 9 Maneuver training commands
- l Infantry brigade
- 1  Infantry brigade (mechanized)
- 1  Infantry brigade (light)
- 2 Transportation brigades
- 3 Military police  brigades
- 2 Engineer brigades
- 2 Medical brigades
- 4 Hospital centers
- 106  Hospitals (miscellaneous)
- 60  Separate battalions

## Strength

The number of reservists  and  guardsmen  part1c1pating  in troop unit training increased in fiscal  year  1981  as  recruitment, reenlistment, and retention programs continued to produce good results.  Army  Reserve drill  pay  strength was  220,122  as  of 30 September 1981, a  gain of 17,495 over the previous year.  The Army National Guard's  assigned strength climbed to 390,659 as compared with 368,254 on 30 September 1980.

Recruiting achievements in  the  Army's reserve components can be seen in the table below.  Both the ARNG and the USAR exceeded their enlistment goals.

*Based on percent of eligibles.

A major element of the reenlistment effort was the Selected Reserve Incentive Program (SRIP). The intent of the program is  to influence members to reenlist in early deploying units and selected skills by offering $900 for a three-year and $1800 for a six-year commitment. The bonus is aimed at increasing the per› sonnel readiness of  these selected units and military occupational specialties  (MOS).  The application  of eligibility  restrictions  al› lowed only about 21,000 of the 108,000 reenlistment-extensions to receive a  bonus in fiscal  year 1981.

As  indicated  in  the  table  below,  high  retention  rates  have helped to keep annual losses relatively low as compared with total enlisted strength.  Attrition, however,  continued to be a  serious problem. Almost 51,000 of  the ARN  G's  losses for fiscal year 1981 were  unprogrammed,  that  is,  individuals  who  left before com› pleting their term  of service.  During the  past  year  the  ARNG began forming a full-time attrition and retention force. Thus far 77 personnel have been assigned to work with the states on their attrition and retention programs.  An additional  179 personnel were scheduled to join the force in fiscal  year  198  2.

Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) strength rose slightly during the year as an increase in officer enrollment more than offset a drop in enlisted strength. In January 1981 a bonus program was begun which offered $600 to qualified members leaving the ac› tive and reserve components who would commit themselves to a three-year tour in the IRR or the Inactive National Guard (ING). It did not prove successful and  was  discontinued at the end of the fiscal  year. Screening of the entire Standby Reserve, started on 1 July 1981  and scheduled for completion during fiscal  year 1982, served to reduce further the number assigned to it. The status of the IRR and the Standby Reserve as of 30 September 1981  is shown  below:

| IRR                                   | Strength         | Change   |

| Total ..........................      | 5,014            | - 14,393 |

The policy of  retaining eligible personnel in the ING rather than discharging them substantially increased this Ready Reserve re› source during the year.  ING strength as of 30 September 1981 was  8,871,  a  gain  of 3,337  for  the  year.  ING  members  were attached  to  units and  would be available for  military service  in the event of mobilization.

Minority strength in the ARNG increased during fiscal  year 1981,  but at a  slightly  slower  pace than overall  strength gains, and reflected 2  5.  7 percent of  assigned strength as of 30 Septem› ber 1981. Total minority strength at the end of fiscal  year  1981 was  100,379-3,318  officers and  warrant  officers  and  97,061 enlisted  personnel.  Of this  total,  65,012  (16.6  percent)  were Blacks,  27,623  (7.1  percent) were  Hispanics,  and 7,744 (2  per› cent) were other minorities. Minority women represented 2 per› cent of total  minority officer representation.

The National Guard Bureau participated in Department of Defense workshops at national conventions of several organiza› tions  concerned  with  the problems of minorities,  including the NAACP, GI Forum, the National Urban League, Blacks in Gov› ernment, and Federally Employed Women, Inc. The recruitment

of  Black officers received continued emphasis that was enhanced by  the visits  of the chief of the  National Guard Bureau  to his› torically Black  colleges.  Lt.  Gen.  La Vern E.  Weber, Chief,  Na› tional Guard Bureau, received the Roy Wilkins Award at the 1981 NAACP National Convention for this active support in the re› cruitment  and  advancement of Black  officers  in  the  National Guard.

At  the  end  of the  year  there  were  19,622  women  in  the ARNG-1,653 officers and warrant officers and 17,969 enlisted personnel.  Women  made  up 5.1  percent of the enlisted  ranks, 4.3  percent of officer strength,  and  5  percent of overall strength-up from 4.5 percent at the end of  the fiscal year 1980. Minority women represented one-fifth, or 330, of all women of› ficers  and  37.6  percent,  or 6,751,  of all  enlisted  women.  The selection of  women for state Officer Candidate Schools, ROTC, and the Simultaneous Membership  Program  has been  the  pri› mary impetus for the increased accession of women  into the of› ficer  ranks as  well  as  for the increase in  minority officers.

Led by innovative officer procurement programs, such as the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) and the Early Com› missioning Program (ECP),  the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) has  emerged as  a  key  source  of officer accessions  for the ARNG. During fiscal year 1981, approximately 1,200 officers were commissioned in the ARNG from ROTC. The assignment of fifty-one  ARNG  officers  to  ROTC detachments  under  the Expand the Base (ETB) program and the additional funding of ROTC scholarships for the Selected Reserve were significant fac› tors  in  the current and projected increase  of officer accessions from ROTC. ROTC was weU on the way to becoming the primary source of new officers entering the ARNG.

The ARNG medical accession  program, which  was  initiated in  March  1979,  has  reduced the  ARNG's shortage of medical officers.  At the beginning of  fiscal year  1981, only 46.5 percent of the  positions  authorized  for ARNG medical  officers  were filled;  by  the end of  the fiscal  year, the number of medical corps officers on board had risen to 50 percent of  authorized strength. The implementation of the fiscal  year 1982 ARNG medical re› cruiting force should also  help diminish  the physician shortage. A  total  of thirty-two officers  plus  three  enlisted  personnel will make up the recruiting force.  Plans have  been initiated to place these people in twenty-eight states.

In the Army Reserve, AMEDD (Army Medical Department), enlisted strength  assigned  to troop program  units  increased  to 22,905 by the end of  fiscal year 1981. This total represented 76.6

percent of  authorized strength and a growth of 7.6 percent over the previous fiscal  year.  Gains were also made in the number of medical corps officers serving the  Army Reserve medical  units and in the Individual Ready Reserve.

## Personnel Management

In April 1981  the ARNG and USAR received authorization to  man combat,  medical, and military  police  units  of battalion size and smaller up to 12  5 percent of  wartime enlisted strength. The new overstrength policy also authorized lieutenant and cap› tain  positions  in  these  units  to  be  filled  up  to  125  percent  of authorized strength.

In another move to provide additional personnel to selected units for improved training and mobilization readiness, the full› time  manning (FTM) program was  expanded during the year. Full-time manning for ARNG units increased from 1,108 ARNG and 624 active  Army  positions to  1,889 and  784,  respectively. FTM positions in USAR units increased from 2,519 (2,073 USAR and 446 active Army) in fiscal year 1980 to 3,661  (2,923 USAR and 738 active  Army)  in  fiscal  year  1981.  FORSCOM  was  au› thorized to apply  770 active Army spaces and 2,520 Army  Re› serve and Army National Guard spaces to the program in  fiscal year  1982.

In addition to active Army and reserve component members, full-time  support was  provided by  military  technicians  (federal employees occupying technician positions who must be members of the  ready  reserve  as  a  condition  for  employment) and  civil service  personnel  (federal  employees  other  than  military  tech› nicians).  Under  the  congressionally  directed  test  to  determine the feasibility of  using reserve component personnel on full-time duty in  lieu  of dual status civilian  technicians,  which  ended 30 June  1980,  4,437  positions were converted (3,161  ARNG and 1,276 USAR). Because the Army was attracting enough personnel to meet its conversion goals, the budget was programmed for and Congress approved continued conversion in fiscal year 1981 of 2,836 (2,473 ARNG and 363 USAR) technician positions.

In order to  pull  the  full-time  support program  together,  a Full-Time Support (FTS)  Force  Management Plan  (FMP) and Objective Force was designed. The FMP will consist of  personnel management policies and numerical characteristics for each com› ponent of the objective force  and  will  cover accession,  profes› sional  development  (including  training and education), distribution and utilization, continuation, evaluation, promotion,

and separation (including retention in other programs). The plan will  recognize  the inherent differences  between  the USAR and ARNG work forces, as well as the various categories of  personnel in the FTS programs (Active Guard/Reserve, military technician, civil  service, and active component).

ODCSPER prepared a  proposal to increase  the number of additional  unit-training  assemblies  authorized  each  year  from twelve to twenty-four and to permit scheduling for administrative and support activities as well as for training. OSD had not acted on the proposal by the close of the reporting period.

The  Army  Reserve  expanded  its  Long-Tour  Management Program to cover over 5,000 USAR personnel serving full-time in Active Guard/Reserve status. They are working in a  number of areas,  including control  and policy,  career management,  re› cruiting, retention, full-time manning, Army Reserve Technician Redesignation  Program,  JUMPS-SIDPERS,  and  reserve  com› ponent projects. The greatest expansion was in the full-time man› ning  program,  which  provides  full-time  support  for  reserve component units to increase their mobilization readiness.

In  the  first  full  year  of operation,  the  National  Guard Bu› reau's (NGB)  Organizational  Effectiveness  (OE)  program  pro› vided consultant support to National Guard units throughout the nation on a broad spectrum of organizational issues.  More than 50 percent of  OE field operations were conducted at the general officer level (separate brigade, division, and state headquarters). Several senior Army and Air National  Guard officers attended training courses of the U.S.  Army Organizational Effectiveness Center and School (USACECS), and forty ARNG general officer commanders participated in FORSCOM High Performance Pro› gramming Seminars.

The Office, Chief Army Reserve, gave additional focus to the myriad issues related to mobilization  planning by establishing a Mobilization  and  Plans office on  l  April  1981.  The office  has worked with other mobilization agencies to resolve deficiencies uncovered in  recent mobilization  exercises,  has participated  in the preparation for future exercises, and has helped identify new issues relevant to real and potential mobilization situations.

At  the  Reserve  Components Personnel  and  Administration Center (RCPAC), the Mobilization Plans and Requirements Of› fice  updated the five~year plan for personnel mobilization that it had issued early  in  fiscal  year  1981,  in  light of comments sub› mitted  by  the  Army  staff,  FORSCOM,  TRADOC, and  DAR› COM. This update ensured compatability of efforts throughout the Army's  personnel mobilization community. The plan set goals

and methods of achievement  for  each  RCPAC activity and en› couraged a  cooperative effort to produce the best possible  mo› bilization procedures.

RCPAC used separate systems to support personnel manage› ment of Army reservists,  one for  officers  and  one  for  enlisted persons. The pilot program for officers-The Officer Personnel System,  the  Army  Reserve  (TOPSTAR)-began  in  November 197  4 under the direction of  the Chief, Army Reserve. Its success led to the approval  of the  Officer  Personnel Management Sys› tem-U  .S. Army Reserve (OPMS-USAR), which was fully imple› mented in three phases from fiscal year l 977 through fiscal year 1979. The pilot program involving 5,000 enlisted personnel be› gan in fiscal  year 1978. Another 40,000 were added by the close of  fiscal  year  1981, and 40,000 more will be added in fiscal  year 1982. Full implementation of the enlisted system was scheduled for completion in fiscal year 1987, at which time around 280,000 enlisted reservists would be  under active  management.  RCPAC added improvements to both systems during fiscal year 1981, and work continued on the development of a  combined Officer En› listed Personnel  Management System (OEPMS).

Module I of  SIDPERS-USAR (Standard Installation Division Personnel  System)  became operational  during fiscal  year  198  I, replacing the Reserve Personnel Information Reporting System (RPIRS).  ln addition  to  the  data processing  support  formerly provided by RPIRS, module I of SIDPERS-USAR contained a telecommunications  link  to  the  CONUS  armies  data  base,  an automated retirement point  accounting subsystem, a consolidated data base that included all members of troop program units, and a limited interface with  JUMPS-RC for data verification. Module II of the system was still being developed at the close of  the fiscal year.

In  April  1981  a  detailed functional  system  requirement for SIDPERS-ARNG was completed. Later in  the year, staffing for the project was arranged. SIDPERS-ARNG will be implemented in  two  phases, beginning in  the fall  of 1983.

The microfilming of reserve records (MICORR) to convert the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) of  all troop program unit and Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) members to microfiche moved forward during the past year. To date, RCPAC has filmed approximately  40,000  office  personnel  files  on  updatable  mi› crofiche using the transparent electrophotographic process man› ufactured by  the A.B.  Dick Co.  By  the close of the fiscal  year, RCPAC  was  concentrating on  updating these  records,  while  a private firm under contract to the Army was at work converting

86,000 officer and enlisted records down to the grade of E-6 to microfiche,  which RCPAC will  then  maintain.  About  275,000 records of  personnel in grades E-1 through E-5 will be  converted later.

In September 1979, FORSCOM submitted a mission element needs statement (MENS)  for an automated data processing net› work that would link all  levels  of the  reserve  components unit command  and  functional  structure  and  would  provide  more timely and accurate data on personnel and logistical  readiness. Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), approved the MENS for the new network,  which  was  called the  Continental Army Management Information System (CAMIS), on 25 October 1979. Resources were obtained in the 1983-1987 Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and CAMIS, a Class III system un› der AR  18-1, Automation Management. The product manager charter required for a  Class  III system  was  prepared by  FOR› SCOM, staffed from interested commands, agencies, and HQDA, and approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Army (IL&amp;FM) on July 1981. As the fiscal  year drew to a close, FORSCOM was preparing to staff a  complete CAMIS office and to develop the system for fielding during fiscal  years  1985 and 1986.

In  a  follow-up  action  to  the  Army  Command  and  Control Study-1982 (ACCS-82),  the Office,  Chief Army  Reserve (OCAR),  with  FORSCOM support, requested proposals to de› velop  a  comprehensive  USAR  Automation  Management  Plan (USARAMP). The main purpose of the plan would be to acquire and field automated data processing support for the USAR that could be integrated with  active  Army systems  and to facilitate the transition to wartime operations. The BDM Corporation won the contract for developing the plan. Completion was scheduled for January  1982.

## Equipment

During fiscal  year  1981  the status of ARNG equipment im› proved slightly,  with the value of  equipment on hand increasing by approximately $500 million.  At the end of fiscal  year  1981, the ARNG needed an inventory valued at $11.8 billion to meet full  wartime mobilization requirements. To meet peacetime au› thorizations,  the  requirement was  $10.4 billion. ,Equipment on hand was valued at $8.1 billion, leaving a shortfall of  $3.  7 billion from the wartime equipment requirement of $11.8 billion. On› hand assets met 78 percent of the peacetime authorization and 69 percent of the wartime requirement.

The following shows the overall status of ARNG equipment at the close of fiscal year  1981.

| Equipment Level                                                                              | Dollar Value Standard Prices   |

The ARNG continued to modernize its logistics management capability. Eight ARNG divisions, thirteen separate brigades, and three round-out brigades were operating under the Division Lo› gistics  System  (DLOGS),  but they  were using antiquated  UNI› VAC  1005  equipment  which  was  difficult  to  maintain  and probably could not be supported in a  theater of operations. Ex› tension of the DLOGS to the four remaining brigades has been deferred indefinitely  because  of a  lack  of computer hardware. Looking toward modernization, one nondivisional direct support unit has received the new Decentralized Automated Service Sup› port System (DAS3). This system automates routine supply man› agement and  provides the commander with constant inventory visibility. DAS3  will  be  extended  to  an  additional  forty-eight ARNG Direct Support-General Support (DS-GS) units during the next two years. Replacement of  the DLOGS (UNIVAC 1005) with the DAS3 system is scheduled for fiscal years  1985-1987.

ARNG materiel  readiness programs were effective, and op› erational  readiness  rates  for  most equipment were  comparable to  the active  Army.  One problem area has  been  the increasing shortfalls in stock-funded repair parts. The  fiscal year 1982 short› fall  is  projected to be $83  million. This has forced a decrease in the amount of repair parts stocked at United States Property and Fiscal Offices (USPFO), an increase in order and shipment times, and a  reduced capability to support mobilization.

Increased use of  equipment located at Mobilization and Train› ing Equipment Sites  (MATES)  and  Unite Training Equipment Sites (UTES)  has  placed considerable strain  on  the  ARNG  lo› gistics system.  Manpower ceilings and constraints on technician funding  have  forced  a  growing  portion  of maintenance  to  be performed by  unit personnel  rather than by  technicians,  which results in  the loss of training time.

Funding for ARNG organizational clothing and equipment continued to be a problem during fiscal year 1981. Procured from

the Army Stock Fund, adequate amounts of unit support items, such as  medical  field  sets,  tentage,  tool  and  test sets,  chemical defense equipment supplies,  fire  direction sets,  mounts and  in› stallation  kits,  winter clothing, safety  items,  sleeping gear,  and camouflage screens, are critical to unit mobilization and deploy› ment  readiness.  At  the  current  programmed  rate  of support, ARNG clothing and  equipment shortages (totaling  over  $518 million at the end of  fiscal year 1981) will not be filled until fiscal year 1987 at the earliest. Problems in this area are compounded by budget constraints, rapidly rising costs, and increased sophis› tication in authorized items of military equipment.

Thirty-four items or weapons systems are planned for intro› duction  into  the ARNG during fiscal  year  1984  through  fiscal year 1988 under the Army's  force modernization program. The number of new  systems  programmed  for  introduction  include the UH-60 helicopter, the Ml tank, the Ml98 howitzer, air de› fense  weapons,  mortars, combat vehicles,  and personnel armor systems for ground troops.

Force modernization in the Army Reserve also increased dur› ing fiscal  year 1982 through restructuring, mission realignment, and equipment upgrade. Thirty-one new equipment items were earmarked for the USAR between fiscal  years  1982 and  1991.

Army Reserve equipment assets at the close of  fiscal year 1981 are indicated below:

| Equipment Level                                                | Dollar Value (Millions)   | % on band   |

## Facilities and Construction

The Army Reserve military construction program for fiscal year  1981  amounted  to  $46.9  million,  including  $3.7  million from a special appropriation to meet general construction needs in the reserve components. The total cost represented an increase of $16.9 million over the previous year's budget.  The addition of $17.1  million  in  carryover funds  brought  the  total  amount available to $64 million, of  which $50 million was obligated, leav› ing $14 million in carryover funds for fiscal year 1982. The con› struction  program  for  fiscal  year  1982  was  budgeted  at  $39 million, and congressional action to increase this amount by ap-

proximately $25 million was anticipated. Total construction re› quirements have  risen from  $338.4 million at the end of fiscal year 1971  to $898 million this year. In addition to continued cost escalation,  this  increase  is  related to additional  projects needed to replace obsolete or deteriorated facilities.

There were approximately 1,000 USAR facilities at the end of  fiscal  year 1981, ranging from  permanent t!·aining centers to leased structures.  Approximately  60 percent of the existing fa› cilities were inadequate. Long-range military construction plans provide for  replacement of deteriorated facilities,  expansion of existing facilities  to meet space  requirements, and replacement of leased facilities  with those that are government owned.

The Army National Guard military construction program re› ceived $42.3  million in new  obligational authority in  fiscal year 1981, an increase of $18.6 million over the fiscal year  1980 ap› propriation. Unobligated balances  from  prior years  totaling $5 million  brought the amount available  to  $47.3  million.  Obliga› tions for the year were $37.1  million,  78 percent of the amount available.  During the year, contracts were awarded for 41  major projects totaling $30.3 million, or 87 percent of  the amount pro› grammed. This represented an improvement of over 6  percent when compared with the previous year. Major contracts included 19  armory  projects and  24  nonarmory projects.  Also  awarded were 56 minor construction projects amounting to $4.8 million. Of the  $740-million  backlog  of ARNG  construction  require› ments, $651  million worth were identified as major construction projects.

## Training and Readiness

The  limited  time  allotted  for  training  reserve  component units  to perform wartime  tasks  (thirty-eight or thirty-nine days per year) put a premium on developing and carrying out effective training programs that promote unit readiness and enhance in› dividual proficiency.

The Battalion Training Management System,  introduced in the reserve components in fiscal year 1980, has proved an effec› tive  tool  in tailoring training to meet the specific needs of each unit.  The Army Training Board, proponent of the system, con› ducted cadre course  manager  training  for  personnel  at Army Readiness  and  Mobilization  Regions,  Readiness  Groups,  and Army Reserve Commands, who in turn ran numerous workshops on management concepts and principles for reserve component unit  personnel. The knowledge brought  back from the workshops

has helped unit commanders to select appropriate soldier manuals and Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP) tasks,  to establish priorities based on  the importance of the tasks  to  the unit's preparation  for  performing wartime missions,  and to de› termine whether training in these tasks should be accomplished during inactive duty training or annual training.

An evaluation of  the Army reserve components' nuclear role, completed in January 1980, concluded that their artillery should have a  dual nuclear-conventional capability.  In response to the study,  a  working group composed of representatives from  the Army  staff and  major  commands  recommended  a  number  of actions  to  improve  the  administration  and  support of reserve component nuclear training programs. These actions  led  to an expansion of  the affiliation program and the establishment in the Army National Guard of annual training assemblies to help ar› tillery  units  attain and  maintain  a  nuclear weapons  proficiency equal to each unit's  conventional readiness standards. FORSCOM Readiness Groups established nuclear  weapons  publications ac› counts and  received  responsibility  for  tactical  nuclear  training assistance.  FORSCOM has been working with  MILPERCEN to ensure that, whenever possible, personnel assigned to Readiness Group field artillery assistance  teams have experience with  nu› clear operations. In addition, nuclear trainers have been assigned to  nuclear  weapon  support  units,  and  ancillary  equipment  has been redistributed based on the type and number of units being supported.

Reserve component specialized training included greater par› ticipation in command post exercises-WINTEx/CIMEX 81, Lo› GEX  81,  and  POTENT  PUNCH  81-and in  major field  training exercises-BRIMFROST 81, OCEAN  VENTURE 81, BORDER STAR 81,  FLINTLOCK  81,  SOLID  SHIELD  81,  and  REFORGER  81.  An additional 193 early-deploying reserve component units received deployment training in  Europe and the Pacific during their an› nual two-week active duty training stint.

The number of USAR units or cells participating in overseas deployment training increased  to 85. Of these,  78  went to Eu› rope, 6 to  Japan, and 1 to Korea. As the number of  units deployed increased,  the number of participants per unit decreased.  This trend is expected to continue, and future deployments will prob› ably  involve an  increase in  participation by cells rather than by whole units.

Ninety-seven Army National Guard units or cells conducted annual training overseas. Many of  the units trained with the com› mands to which they would be assigned under the CAPSTONE

program in the event of war.  An additional twelve ARNG units or cells took part in the annual REF0RGER field training exercise.

For the second time, a battalion-sized unit, 2d Battalion, 152d Infantry (M), 38th  Infantry  Division,  Indiana ARNG, partici› pated in  the  deployment program. The unit deployment from its home station to Europe, drew POMCUS equipment, took part in  the REF0RGER  exercise, turned in  POMCUS equipment and redeployed to its  home station.  The unit had a  very successful training experience that is  certain to add another dimension to its  mobilization-deployment planning and training.  For the first time an ARNG division headquarters took part in overseas de› ployment training.  The Headquarters and Headquarters Com› pany of the 38th Infantry Division deployed a tactical operations center (approximately 125 people) to Europe and participated in command  post exercise  CARRIAGE  CLOCK,  part of the overall REF0RGER  exercise.  The 38th Infantry Division was  hosted  by VII Corps.

The  National  Guard  Bureau,  in  coordination  with FOR› SCOM,  developed  a  new  training initiative  in  fiscal  year  1981 called the Key  Personnel  Upgrade Program (KPUP).  Its objec› tives  are  to  improve  individual  skills  of key ARNG personnel through a one-on-one relationship with an active Army counter› part,  to  expose ARNG unit leaders and staff officers  to active Army training and operational duties, and to foster Total Army policy  through  direct  association  between  active  Army  and ARNG leaders.  Despite  limited  funding,  200  personnel  from ARNG divisions,  combat  brigades,  and  armored  cavalry  regi› ments participated in the new program. The response from both ARNG and active  Army  units  has been  positive,  and plans are being developed to increase the program in  fiscal  year 1982.

Mobilization training for Individual Ready Reserve members progressed  during fiscal  year  1981,  despite  dollar  constraints. Training  included  6,669  mobilization  augmentee  or  designee tours,  1,243 active duty site support tours, and  lS,733 counter› part or school training tours.

Following  the  successful  conclusion  of a  pilot  program  in 1978,  the  IRR  aviation  training  program  experienced  steady growth in the number of  aviators trained. In fiscal year 1980 the program covered 440 flying  tours, 43 school tours,  102 mobili› zation  designee tours,  and  36 site support tours.  In fiscal  year 1981 participation increased to 500 flying tours, 7  8 school tours, 108 mobilization tours, and 52 site support tours. Approximately 450 aviators received training during the year, a figure that was expected to rise  to about 800 per year by  1983. The program

has  been successful  in  producing qualified copilots  to fill  active Army pilot shortages in event of mobilization and  has  reduced the  requirements  to  train  replacement  aviators  for  the  active Army, which costs over $100,000 for each new aviator.

In competitive sports, the USAR shooting team continued to strengthen its position as the dominant force in the field of  com› petitive shooting in the United States.  Of 95 major U.S.  cham› pionships,  including  the  National  Gallery  Championship,  the Interservice International Championships, the National Rifle and Pistol  Championships, and the  U.S. International Shooting Championships, the Army Reserve won 40 titles. USAR shooters captured 9 of 14 places on the U.S. Air Gun Team, which com› peted in the world championships, and 16 of 57 positions on the U.S. shooting team, which will compete in the Championship of the Americas.

In the thirty-fourth annual Interallied Confederation of Re› serve Officers Congress and Military Competitions held  in  Oir› schot, The Netherlands, 3-7 August 1981, U.S. reservists placed first  and second in the  overall category and first in the novice team category.  Other team and individual accomplishments in› cluded best overall marksmanship team score, best overall com› bined obstacle course team score, best orienteering team score, as  well as two second-place finishes  in submachine gun and rifle and a  first-place  win  in  pistol.

The  CAPSTONE program started  the  fiscal  year  with  all major Army commands and subordinate commands in receipt of the FORSCOM Implementing Plan. All depicted organizational associations  were  formalized  and  all  associated  units  had  been informed of their  assignments.  Major commands of the active Army and reserve components conducted coordinated planning and established training associations keyed on inactive duty train› ing and annual training. Major elements of the CAPSTONE or› ganizations participated in command post exercises, field training exercises,  and  logistic  and  REFORGER  exercises.  The  Overseas Deployment Training Program  was  keyed  to  CAPSTONE or› ganizations. The expanded Affiliation Program linked more ac› tive Army units with their reserve component associates.

The Affiliation  Program  continued  to  be one of the  most valuable  tools  in  helping reserve  component  units  to  improve their  readiness  and  deployment posture.  The program started fiscal  year  1981  with  90 battalions and 67 company- or detach› ment-sized units. During the year 11 battalions and 134 company› or detachment-sized units were added.  This expansion  was  the

first  major step  in  aligning the  Affiliation  Program with  CAP› STONE.

Recent developments during the year, including CAPSTONE and the creation of the Rapid Deployment Force, made it advis› able to take an in-depth look at the concept of affiliation before proceeding with further expansion. FORSCOM initiated such an analysis during  July 1981.

The final  report on the  Rapid  Mobilization for  Direct De› ployment to POMCUS (RAMDEP) was completed and submitted to  HQDA and FORSCOM on 30 January 1981.  RAMDEP ex› ercises clearly demonstrated that direct deployment was feasible, but that many refinements would be needed before the concept could become a reality.  In a  follow-up action, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS) formed an ad hoc committee to develop an action plan to deploy reserve component units directly from their home stations. The committee consisted of  representatives  from  the  ODCSOPS,  the  Army  National Guard Bureau, and the Office,  Chief Army  Reserve.  By June 1981  the group had drafted direct deployment guidance for in› clusion  in  the  Army  Mobilization  Planning  System  (AMOPS). The guidance directed FORSCOM to develop direct deployment requirements and training and to select reserve component units for a  direct deploying  role.  Nomination and selection of direct deploying units  by  FORSCOM  is  expected to be completed  by June 1982.

## Support to Civil Authorities

Fiscal year  1981  again saw  the National Guard, in its role of organized  militia,  respond  to  the  calJ  from  state authorities  to help preserve and protect life and property and maintain order. This  year  20,843  Guard  personnel  responded  to  374 call-ups involving civil  emergencies in  forty-three states.

Guard personnel  were  placed on state  active duty fourteen times to assist civil authorities in civil disturbance control oper› ations.  The  calls  involved  eleven  states  and  5,122  personnel. These operations included 5 employee strikes, 5 civil disorders, and 4  potential civil  disorders.  Additionally,  units  were alerted to provide assistance in the event of  a  threatened postal strike.

During fiscal year 1981  there were 360 call-ups in forty states to assist civil authorities in  dealing with other emergencies. Nat› ural  disasters  accounted  for  87  call-ups-46  forest  fires, 19 floods,  9 snow and ice storms, 2  windstorms, and 11  tornadoes. Twenty-nine  support missions  were  performed  to  preserve  life

and protect property endangered by natural disasters. Included was  the effort to eliminate the disastrous and elusive  medfly  in California,  which  caused  massive  damage  to  fruit  crops  there. Medical  evacuation  and  support  required  139  missions,  and search and rescue operations involved 64 call-ups. Droughts and other water emergencies required 30 water hauls; and the pres› idential inaugural, security-traffic control, train wrecks, chemical spills  explosions,  emergency shelters,  EOD (explosive  ordnance disposal) support, and power outages accounted for the remain› ing  13  missions.  A  total  of 15,721  National  Guardsmen  were called for duty in  these areas.

## 9. Organization and Management

## Organization

The success of large and complex institutions like the Army depends largely on their ability to adapt to changes in  their en› vironment. For the Army a critical factor in  this process is main› taining command and management structures geared to identify, promote,  and  implement concepts,  doctrines,  and  weapon  sys› tems which an expanding technology, the dynamics of  a changing and sometimes  volatile  world,  and  domestic  considerations  re› quire. During fiscal  year  1981, the Army's efforts in this regard focused  on  mobilization,  modernization, and resource  manage› ment.

Various  mobilization  exercises  like  NIFTY  NUGGET and MOBEX  80  led  to  efforts  to  improve  the  Army's mobilization planning.  Secretary Marsh elevated the rank of the deputy  for mobilization and analysis in June  1981  to Deputy Assistant Sec› retary for Reserve Affairs and Mobilization in  the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Manpower and Reserve Affairs.

The Vice  Chief of Staff also  took  action.  Concerned  that critical  mobilization  decisions  had not been  made soon enough to deploy troops in a timely manner and that the Army staff had trouble identifying what the critical decisions were, he directed the ODCSOPS Operations and Readiness Directorate to prepare an  HQDA  Mobilization  Decision  Matrix  which  would  identify the decisions and the information required to support them. The Vice Chief of Staff approved an initial  basic  decision  matrix  in February 1981  with instructions to reissue it semiannually as an annex to the Army mobilization and Operations Planning System (AMOPS).

This decision matrix should prove a  useful  tool in  resolving structural and procedural flaws in the mobilization process. Other questions, such as  what staff agencies should  be responsible for integrating programs related  to  mobilization and what was  the most effective  means  of accomplishing  mobilization  programs, still  need  to be  addressed.  At one  time or another  Army staff agencies  and  the  Government  Accounting  Office  (GAO)  have taken on these issues, but a satisfactory solution has been difficult to achieve. A possible approach might be to give central control over  the  vertical  integration  of authority  back  to  subordinate

commanders and managers at all levels of  command, who would either produce results or be replaced. The last office to exercise such authority over the Army staff was  the  Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, which was abolished in  1974.

The successful implementation of  programs to modernize and integrate the Army's numerous tactical ADPS (Automated Data Processing  System)  and  the  telecommunications  networks  de› signed to link with the Worldwide Military Command and Con› trol System (WWMCCS) has eluded management in recent years, as evidenced by numerous shifts in Army staff responsibility for command, control,  communications, and computer systems.  In 197  4 the Office of  the Chief  of  Communications-Electronics (for› merly  the  Chief Signal  Office)  was  abolished  and  its  functions assigned  to  ODCSOPS.  This arrangement did not work out as well as expected, and in October 1978 these functions were trans› ferred to a  new Army staff agency, the Office of Assistant Chief of Staff for Automation and Communications (OACSAC). OAC› SAC's several missions included revising of the basic Army reg› ulations on integration of ADPS and communications systems in the field,  and establishing of an automation-communications ca› reer management program.  ODCSOPS retained its  traditional authority over command and control functions.

Two years later, Lt. Gen.  Glenn K.  Otis, the DCSOPS, Maj. Gen. Clay T. Buckingham, the ACSAC, and Maj. Gen. Thomas U.  Greer, the Director of Management, requested another look at the problem. The resultant staff study recommended that AC› SAC'  s automation and communications functions be consolidated with ODSCOPS command and control (C2) functions.

Informal discussions that took place among the principals over several  months led to the Vice Chief of Staff's decision  in  May 1981  that ACSAC should be disestablished and its functions ab› sorbed by a new Assistant DCSOPS for Command, Control, Com› munications, and Computers (C4), effective  I  October. Whether the ODCSOPS will be able to perform these functions more ef› fectively  than it had before the creation of OACSAC is an open question.

No agency  now exists on the Army staff with  the authority to integrate vertically  the operations of all  Army staff elements in the interest of the Army's total force structure. The heart of the matter is the Army's  modernization program, which requires aggressive innovation to adapt rapidly changing technological ad› vances to replace  wasteful and obsolete ADPS,  telecommunica› tions  networks, weapons systems,  and their outmoded concepts and doctrines.

The Army  Force  Modernization  Coordination  Office (AFMCO) was created within the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1979 to ensure that the Army's  numerous modernization projects were identified, coordinated, assigned to appropriate Army staff agencies  and  major  commands,  and  monitored.  In  September 1981, AFMCO was assigned  responsibility for  coordinating the fielding of Army 86 organization and force structure changes.

The Vice Chief of Staff, the Director of Management, The Inspector General, and the new DCSOPS, Lt.  Gen. William R. Richardson, were not satisfied with the progress being made, and plans were  under  way  to bring AFMCO  under the operational control of the DCSOPS as the fiscal  year ended.  Arrangements were also made to send a special team of investigators from the Office  of The Inspector General  to review  the modernization management process throughout the Army and to recommend changes to the Vice Chief of Staff.

The Annual  Historical  Summary  for  Fiscal  Year  1977  re› ported that General  Meyer,  then DCSOPS, directed the estab› lishment of  a point of  contact for long-range planning within the Strategy, Plans, and Policy Directorate. Because no funds or per› sonnel were available,  nothing was  done until this year.  In Oc› tober  1980  an  Army  Long-Range  Planning (LRP)  Group  was formed in the Office of the Technical Advisor to the DCSOPS. This group is headed by a  colonel and includes three action of› ficers. The purpose of the LRP Group is to develop, coordinate, and produce products which deal with Army long-range objec› tives  and  strategic  requirements.  Particularly,  the  group  is  to provide  impetus for and coordinate the  Army staff long-range planning effort.

The Office of The Inspector General  was  restructured in 1981. The principal changes were a reduction in the number of deputies to The Inspector General and a consequent realignment of responsibilities. The Inspector General now has two deputies. Deputy The Inspector General (Investigations,  Assistance,  and Compliance) supervises the Investigations Division, Assistance Di› vision,  and Audit and Inspection Compliance Division.  Deputy The Inspector General (Inspections) is responsible for all inspec› tion activities of  the Department of  the Army Inspector General Agency.  He supervises  the  Inspections  Division,  the  Technical Inspections Division, and the Training Management Inspections Division.

A  significant change  in  the  emphasis  of inspections  by  the Department of the Army Inspector General Agency (DAIG) is under way. DAIG general  inspections  of subordinate activities

were focused primarily on evaluating compliance with pertinent formal guidance. These "compliance" inspections were useful to the extent that they gave commanders an idea of how well  sub› ordinates were conforming to directives or regulations. However, they  tended  to address symptoms  instead  of causes,  made  the assumption that policy guidance and directives were correct, and isolated the problems of the inspected unit from the rest of the Army.

Current emphasis is on the systemic approach to inspections. This  focuses  attention  on  causes  rather than symptoms,  allows policy errors or ommissions to be discovered for resolution,  in› corporates unit problems into Army problems, emphasizes cor› rection  at  the  proper  level,  eliminates  the  significant  waste  of time and other resources,  and  minimizes  the need  for  special, one-time preparation.

Another area  of continued emphasis at DAIG is  inspection compliance follow-up  procedures.  This essential  step in  the in› spection  process  is  designed  to  review  proposed corrective  ac› tions,  verify  that  the  corrective  action  was  carried  out,  and evaluate whether the problem was solved. The goal is to ensure that when problems are identified, corrections are made.

For  several  years  the  Office  of The  Inspector General  has aggressively pursued automated assistance for its functions. This automation effort is  called  the Inspector General  Management Information and Reporting System, or IGMIRS.  IGMIRS pro› vides  automated  tools  to  elements  of  the  Inspector  General Agency  using  data processing equipment and personnel of the U.S.  Army Management Systems Support Agency (USAMSSA). Computer processing is accomplished on USAMSSA hardware, and resulting management reports are given to DAIG action of› ficers.  Coordination with  USAMSSA  is  the responsibility of the Automation Management Office.

During 1980, The Inspector General judged IGMIRS to be potentially beneficial to inspectors general located at both major command (MACOM) and subordinate command  levels and di› rected  the extension of IGMIRS to the MACOMs.  U.S.  Army Computer Systems Command (USACSC) adapted IGMIRS for use on computers at each major command, and during 1981  the resulting standard system  was installed at eleven  MACOMs.  In› spectors general at t!-iese commands are better able to assimilate all  available  IG information, as  well  as data from  audit  reports written on their unit by the Army Audit Agency, Defense Audit Service, and the General Accounting Office. Inspectors general can summarize data from findings contained within these reports

and present that information to their commanders in such a way that root causes of problems are identified.

As  reported last year, the Army began a  review, or "scrub," of  positions in noncom  bat, nondeployable support units to relieve military  personnel  shortages  in  higher deployable  combat and combat support units.  Analysts  conducting  the scrub  were  re› quired to identify position authorizations which  could be elimi› nated and transferred to the deployable units to improve overall combat readiness. Analysts were also to identify positions which could be reduced in  grade to permit better alignment of assets and position requirements.

Based on the response of  field commanders to the review, the Vice Chief  of  Staff  announced a modification of  the scrub process in  September  1980.  This  modification  gave  the  affected  com› mands and agencies greater flexibility in determining units and functions to which eliminated positions could be transferred. The Vice Chief of Staff initiated a review of the scrub action in Sep› tember  1981  based  on  additional  communications  from  field commanders. As a  result of this review,  the remaining portions of the TDA scrub would  be canceled early in fiscal  year  1982. Commands were directed to make use of the work already done and to report on actions taken by  31  December I 981.

Overall, MACOM use of the TDA scrub recommendations resulted  in 493  position authorizations  being moved  to higher priority functions-105 officer,  2  warrant officer,  304 enlisted, and 82 civilian-and 2,274 positions downgraded-352 officer and 1,922 enlisted.

The Army continued its various  base  closures and  realign› ments this year. In October the ASA (IL&amp;FM) directed that fam› ily housing units at Fort Wadsworth, New York, be reopened and made available for occupancy. The Department of the Navy re› quested and received OSD approval to relocate the Naval Resale and Services Support Office to Fort Wadsworth from Brooklyn, New York.  The disposal  report for  the  transfer of Fort Wads› worth  to  the  Department of the  Interior was  withdrawn.  The Secretary of the Interior advised that his department would not pursue acquisition and management of land at Fort Wadsworth in  the foreseeable future, and that this would be consistent with legislation that created Gateway National Recreation Area.

The Army announced in September that Fort Monroe would remain open and would continue as the home of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. The final  environmental im› pact statement on the proposed realignment of Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, was filed with the Environmental Protection

Agency in April  I  981.  The General  Accounting Office under› took a  review  of the  realignment  study  documents,  which was completed  in  August.  At  the  end of the year  no  decision  had been made.

The realignment study for Fort Sheridan, Illinois, was revised in July. As space was no longer available at the Great Lakes Naval Base,  only  those  proposals that considered Fort Benjamin Har› rison as a possible relocation site were restudied. An Army Audit Agency review of the documents was completed in  August,  but no decision on the preferred alternative has been announced.

Secretary  Marsh,  in  response  to  strong  congressional  pres› sure, announced in September that the Army would continue to operate its training center at Fort Dix. Repeated attempts have been made since the end of World War II to close Fort Dix in the interest of economy, but to no avail.

A  decision  to close  Vint Hill  Farms Station was  near as  the fiscal  year ended.  Such a  move  would  involve consolidating In› telligence  and  Security  Command  (INSCOM)  headquarters  at Fort Meade, Maryland, after construction of new facilities there was complete. Elements of  the Army Electronics Readiness Com› mand, also  located at Vint Hill  Farms, would be transferred to Fort Monmouth, to the Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania, and to  the  Harry Diamond  Laboratories  in  Woodbridge,  Vir› ginia,  while  Company  B,  303d  Military  Intelligence  Battalion, would move to Fort Hood, Texas.

## Financial Management

The table below shows the Army's  obligations and outlays for fiscal  year 1981 (in millions of  dollars).  As indicated, the Army's cumulative total obligations for the fiscal  year were $56.3 billion against a plan of  $56.4 billion, a variance of  $151  million or -.3 percent. The Army's obligation of funds was  adjusted in March to  include  President Reagan's supplemental  appropriations  re› quest.  Although not adjusted  for  final funding  levels,  the plan represented a goal by which the Army's budget execution could be  gauged.  At year's end,  accounting  reports showed that full obligation of funds had been achieved.

The Army's planned outlay for fiscal  year 1981  was $39 bil› lion, as shown on the table.  Actual outlays were  $37.6 billion, a shortfall of  $1.4 billion or  -3.6 percent. Reasons for this shortfall included  (  1)  late  receipt of the Reagan supplemental  which al› lowed funds to be qbligated but not disbursed, (2) a  larger than anticipated amount of deobligations of prior year funds, and (3)

more favorable  currency exchange  rates  than  had  been antici› pated.

*May nol odd due to rounding.

Because of  congressional budgetary and accounting practices, there is  little  correlation  between  congressional  authorized an› nual obligations and the Army's  annual outlays. The time lag may vary from one to  ten  years.  Congress may compound the time lag by reducing funds for various projects from time to time or by failing  to appropriate money for bills already submitted.

The Army's Commercial  Activities  (CA)  Program  was  for› merly known as the Commercial and Industrial Activities (CITA) Program.  It is  operated  under  instructions contained  in  0MB Circular A-76, which required that all commercial activities not required to be performed in-house (that is,  by government em› ployees) be subjected to rigorous cost comparisons with contrac› tors  in  the  private  sector  to  determine  the  most cost-effective method for performing the activity.

In fiscal year 1981, decisions based on seventy-two cost studies released a  total  of 1,047 civilian  spaces,  which  can be  used  for other Army activities.  These studies also  contributed  to  Army readiness by returning 663 soldiers to their military duties. The cost advantage to the government over a  three-year period was $60 million.

Other significant accomplishments  within  the  CA  Program included the following:  development of prototype Performance Work Statements (PWS)-twenty-eight have been distributed to the  field  and  twenty-two  more  are  in  the  development  stage; drafting of  a new Army regulation covering commercial activities to be published and distributed  to  the field  in  February  1982; and preparation of new  management study guidelines. In addi-

tion, a  management study course was being devised at the Army Logistics  Management Center at Fort Lee,  Virginia.

Army audit, inspection, and internal review activities uncov› ered sixty-eight  potential  fraud  cases,  which  were  referred  to investigative organizations, and  thirty-nine significant instances of waste,  which  were included in Army reports that provided a basis for reporting to Congress pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978 (PL 95-452).

The Army Audit Agency continued to devote significant audit resources to areas that were highly susceptible to fraud,  waste, and mismanagement. The agency initiated two multilocation au› dits.  The first,  on fiscal  year  1981  end-of-year buying practices, was in response to Office of Management and Budget concern. The second, on military pay, came about because a  preliminary survey had disclosed weaknesses in  internal controls. In Decem› ber  1980,  the  agency  issued  an  advisory  report  to  field  com› manders  suggesting  ways  to  reduce  the  incidence  of waste  in vehicle and bus use, vehicle maintenance, fuel consumption, and credit card use.  In February 1981, an advisory report was issued to  the  commander  of the  U.S.  Army  Troop Support  Agency citing problems involving commissary operations that had been noted during audits at eight commissaries. The agency also au› dited a  large  number of Army clubs.

To intensify  audit  coverage  of fraud and  waste,  the  Army Audit Agency developed comprehensive guides for auditing in› stallation  contracting  procedures  and  selected  engineer  func› tions. The guides emphasized fraud-oriented approach and were specifically designed so that  junior auditors could quickly identify potential fraud and mismanagement. At classes conducted by the agency, more than 1,100 Army auditors and internal review per› sonnel received at least three hours of formal  training in  basic techniques of  evaluating internal controls and detecting wasteful and fraudulent conditions.

The Army Auditor General  has a  responsibility  to evaluate the Army internal review function.  During fiscal  year 1981, this responsibility  was  carried out  through performance of accredi› tation reviews at selected internal review  locations.  The agency outlined for the Comptroller of the Army thirty-five suggestions for improving the effectiveness and professionalism of  the Army's internal review  functions.

Internal review efforts were directed at programs identified by commanders and staff  elements as affecting mission objectives. Primary emphasis was on internal controls and areas susceptible to  potential  fraud,  waste,  or other  uneconomical or inefficient

practices.  These reviews  have  provided objective evaluations of command problem areas along with recommendations for cor› rective actions.

The Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACICD) un› dertook  several  initiatives  to  enhance and  support  the  Army's attack on fraud. The entire theory of economic crime was reex› amined and redefined, and new policies were developed to better cope with economic crime on a reactive as well as preventive basis. USACICD's increased emphasis on detecting and  investigating fraud and waste resulted in the discovery of  over 2,500 such cases in  fiscal  year  1981.  In  addition,  over  1,300  crime  prevention surveys were begun. The command has also recently completed a one-year study to identify areas susceptible to economic crime. The study  has  been  used  to  target  crime  prevention  surveys, assign areas of special  concern in economic crime, and identify skills required to meet the needs of  field investigators. The Crim› inal Investigation Command and the Army Audit Agency signed a  memorandum of understanding in October 1980 to formalize procedures for mutual support between the two organizations.

The Army Audit Agency issued reports on a number of  audits which highlighted common problems at numerous installations. Actions  taken  on  the  audit  recommendations  should  result  in improved management of  resources at all levels of  command. The agency reported the following:  the Army needs to make major improvements in identifying and recovering nonrecurring costs of equipment sold to nongovernment customers; Army installa› tions  need  to  follow  Army  and  U.S.  Treasury  procedures  for paying commercial accounts to avoid incurring significant interest costs;  many  basic  tasks  essential  to  successful  operation of the TOW and Dragon missile systems could  not be performed be› cause  operators  lacked  the  necessary  technical skills; year-end purchases did not always represent valid needs; Army installations needed to adhere strictly to operational and accounting controls over bulk petroleum; controls to monitor the use of  commercial telephones in U.S.  Army, Europe, and Seventh Army were not adequate to minimize unauthorized use; the Army was incurring significant costs while  receiving little  benefit from  the DOD-di› rected Materiel Obligation Program (procedures for reconciling and validating unfilled orders); and a  significant amount of en› ergy savings from facilities operations could be obtained through local  management actions.

The Army Audit Agency completed reviews of eighty-four cost  comparisons  under  the  Commercial  Activities  Program. These reviews identified the need for extensive adjustments to

the initial estimates of  government costs used  in deciding whether to perform the activities in house or by contract. The  adjustments involved  unrealistic staffing levels, improper use of  inflation fac› tors,  and various  errors in estimating direct,  indirect, and one› time costs.  The review helped ensure that Army decisions were based on realistic estimates and resulted in the most cost-effective method of performance.

The  Army  Industrial  Fund  (AIF)  pays  for  industrial-com› mercial-type activities at arsenals,  depots,  laboratories,  missile facilities,  and port terminals which  produce goods and services for departments and agencies of DOD as well as for customers outside  of DOD.  AIF capital  is  replenished by collecting  from customers for goods or services rendered.  There are currently twenty-seven AIF installations and activities in the Army with a total annual  business of approximately $3.5  billion.  Annual op› erating budgets are prepared at  each installation  and consolidated by the following major activity grouping: depot activities, missile commands, armament commands, proving grounds and labora› tories,  and  transportation  and  terminal  activities.  Budgets  are reviewed by  the appropriate  major commands (the  U.S.  Army Materiel  Development  and  Readiness  Command  and  Military Traffic Management Command), DA, OSD, 0MB, and Congress. The Comptroller of the Army and the Deputy Chief  of  Staff for Logistics share management responsibilities for the AIF. The ta› ble  below shows the costs  (in  millions  of dollars)  of goods and services sold.

## Records and Publications Management

The Army received 30,958 requests for information or rec› ords under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) during the

year. Over 100 man-years were required to process these requests at a gross cost of $2,610,648. A total of $165,286 was collected for search and copying costs as allowed by the act. These figures represent a  steady increase in the number of requests received annually by the Army as well as a corresponding increase in cost and man-years expended.

The Army made two recommendations for legislative changes to the FOIA and one administrative recommendation. One pro› posal  would exempt the  Department of Defense from  the  pro› visions of the Freedom of Information Act during times of war or other hostilities;  the  other would extend the period of time for federal agencies to respond to requests made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. A recommendation was submitted to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs to elim› inate or modify OSD-imposed triannual reporting of FOIA costs. These initiatives were still pending at the close of the reporting period.

The Army Privacy  Program remained at maintenance level during  I  980.  Management  attention  focused  on  consolidating records into broad "system" descriptions. Continuing opposition by major Army field commanders to the burdensome reporting requirements of the Privacy Act prompted a query to DOD for modification. While 0MB would not support a  DOD legislative proposal  to change or eliminate the annual report, some relief was obtained through DOD's withdrawal of supplementary data not required by  0MB.

The Adjutant General Center's Access  and  Release  Branch responded  to roughly  3.000 requests from  scholars,  historians, private citizens, members of the media, and government officials for records or information from retired Army records.  (These requests were in addition to the 951  requests under the Freedom oflnformation Act processed by the branch.) Approximately one› third of  the requests were for copies of  transcripts; the rest were for a variety of  documents including obsolete publications, maps, general and special orders, and unit histories. Numerous requests were received for records from the Vietnam collection. Response time to these requests varied from  one day  to several weeks or months, depending on the research needed to locate documents. Many requests were referred to the National Archives and Rec› ords Service  (NARS)  for  information  in  their  custody.  Others were  referred  to  various  records  custodians  throughout  the Army.

A one-year contract study of the Army Functional Files Sys› tem (TAFFS) conducted by Calculon Corporation was completed

on  30 September 1981. This study came about  because of dif› ficulties  perceived  throughout  the  Army  in  using  T AFFS  for retrieving general correspondence-type files. Calculon found that the development of office technology was eroding the usefulness of  TAFFS and that TAFFS should be replaced because it cannot be  automated,  has  major  faults  as  a  manual  system,  and  lacks adequate management support. Calculon recommended an eight› een-month test of two concepts; the best features of each could be combined to form a single system for Army use.

One concept would require the development of a  functional and subjective files classification system  based on Army Regula› tion  340-2,  "Maintenance and Disposition of Records  in TOE Units  of the  Active  Army,  the  Army  Reserve,  and  the  Army National  Guard."  Files  would be decentralized and maintained and disposed of in  the same manner as the current system.

The  second  concept,  which  Calculon  labels  as  innovative, would use a  file  classification system  based on the  Army's regu› lation  numbering system.  This  plan  would  include  new  proce› dures  such  as instant  archiving-reproducing  a  copy  of  all permanent records at the time of creation and  immediately re› tiring the record copy to a records holding  area or federal records center.  Retention  or disposition  of records  would  be  based  on usage. The central files system would be brought back; copies of files  would  be  issued  to  users,  and  the  record  copy  would  be retained in the central file.

A  task  group  was  established during April  1979  under the joint leadership of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and  the  Department of Labor (DOL)  to  examine serious  and widespread problems affecting efficient management of federal employees' medical records and to recommend solutions.  Mem› bers of the  task  group also  included representatives of the De› partments  of Defense,  Army,  and  Air  Force,  as  well  as representatives of other federal agencies and organizations.

The group focused  its  attention on  five  major questions of policy: should there be a single medical record (folder) or should there  be  more  than  one  repository  for  such  documents;  what constitutes an employee's medical records; who should  have ac› cess  to these records;  where should the records be stored;  and how should the records be maintained and for  how long.

The task group received more than  110 responses from vir› tually  every  federal  agency  in  the  executive  branch,  the  U.S. Senate, the U.S. Supreme Court, the General Accounting Office, the AFL-CIO, several independent unions, and private citizens. The group concluded that the primary cause of the medical rec-

ords problem was the lack of  a uniform, governmentwide policy governing the maintenance and disposition of the records. Add› ing to the problem was the fragmented authority among federal agencies  which  establish and promulgate standards and regula› tions  relating to  medical  records of employees and the absence of a  universally accepted definition  of the term federal  emplayee medical record. As a result, many records which contain vital med› ical information on an individual's  occupational health and well› being were frequently  lost,  misfiled  in  the  employee's Official Personnel Folder, or destroyed prematurely.

In its  final  report, the task group recommended that an Of› ficial Medical  Folder  (OMF)  similar  to  the  Official  Personnel Folder (OPF) be established as the permanent repository for all medical  records of federal  employees; that, with minor modifi› cation, the term employee medical record used by the Occupational Safety  and  Health  Administration  be  adopted  as  the  govern› mentwide definition  for  determining the  content of the  OMF; that OPM be vested with authority to establish  policies and reg› ulations governing the control and disposition of  employee med› ical  records,  including issuance of policy  guidance on access  to and release of medical  information contained in  the OMF; that upon transfer of an employee from one agency to another, the losing agency should forward the OMF to the gaining agency in the same manner as the Official Personnel Folder and in a  way that ensures confidentiality; and that upon separation from fed› eral service,  the employee's OMF should be retired  to the Na› tional Personnel Records Center where it would be retained for a period of thirty years, unless a longer period is required by law or regulation.

Efforts continued during 1981  to establish control  over the disposition  of data retained  in  more than  3,000 automated sys› tems. In coordination with functional managers and systems per› sonnel,  disposal  standards  for  nonpermanent  data  were established for over 85 percent of proposals received from Army activities.  Proposals for the disposition of master files were eval› uated,  and assessments of the  value  (historical,  archival,  refer› ence, rights-and-interests, and so forth) of the data stored were made.  As information on each system was gathered,  many data errors were corrected and problems solved. For example, many systems with multiple master files  did not make enough distinc› tion  between  functional  purpose  and  planned  disposition.  De› tailed  legwork  and  contact  with  records  management  officials ensured that all master files within the system were appropriately identified, and that the function and value of  each was understood

by users. The inclusion of  data in some systems relating to several functional  areas led  to  problems in identifying the system  with equivalent paper records having different disposition schedules. Measures were taken  to ensure that each distinct data  file  was accurately  correlated  with  existing  paper  record  schedules for evaluation purposes. A continuing problem was the lack of  formal ADP training of some records  managers,  which  resulted  in  a communications gap between the records and automation man› agers and delays in obtaining and dispensing needed processing information.

In October 1980, the  Declassification Operations Branch of the Adjutant General's  Center began planning a review of  retired Southeast Asia War records for declassification, pursuant to the requirements  of  Executive  Order  12065.  The  project  would cover approximately 60,000 cubic feet of  records created during the  years  1954-1975,  including joint records  over  which  the Army has served as executive agent since 1975. The collection was stored, warehouse fashion, at the Washington National Rec› ords  Center  (WNRC),  Suitland,  Maryland.  Intermingling  of classified and unclassified files  at the time of original shipment required that most of the collection  be treated as classified  in› formation. To minimize loss and destruction of records in a com› bat zone,  instructions were given  to Army field  commanders in 1970 to dispose of  no records and to ship all records being retired to the WNRC. This action saved many historically valuable rec› ords from being inadvertently lost or destroyed, but also resulted in a great deal of  dispensible and ephemeral material being held long past its scheduled disposal date. The condition of  the records made effective service, research, and retrieval difficult.

The National Archives and Records Service (NARS) agreed to provide essential support services for the declassification proj› ect  (which  would  also  separate  the  permanent  and  disposable holdings), including work space and materials; TAG would pro› vide personnel to carry out the work. The project was expected to be completed by 31  December 1985, at which time the entire collection would be permanently transferred to NARS.

Because of increasing historical interest and the special needs of the Agent Orange Task Force to answer veterans' claims aris› ing from  purported defoliant and herbicidal  contamination  in Vietnam, the project began with  the combat divisions (together with assigned and attached units) committed to the war in South› east Asia.  By  the end of fiscal  year  1981,  work had been  com› pleted on the  25th,  1st,  23d,  and  9th  Infantry  Divisions.  This resulted  in  100-percent declassification  and  approximately  65-

percent disposal of holdings judged to be transitory and ephem› eral. The 4th Infantry, 1st Air Cavalry, and 101st Airborne Di› visions were scheduled for processing during the first quarter of fiscal  year  1982.

As part of  its overall records management program, the Army administers a duplicate emergency files program to protect rec› ords needed to ensure the continuity of operations of essential Army functions  and activities  during  and  following  a  national emergency.  Basic  authority  for  management  of the  duplicate emergency files is Army Regulation  340-26, which is  being re› vised to prescribe policies and procedures for the selection, dis› tribution, storage, filing, safeguarding, and inventory of  material placed in duplicate emergency files depositories, and to serve as a  model  for  major  Army  commands  in  establishing  their  own duplicate emergency files program.

By  and large,  Army  records  management  procedures  have been developed in peacetime and geared to units and installations in the United States. Because these procedures were cumbersome to the combat commander on the battlefield during the Vietnam War, The Adjutant General's Office examined alJ  areas of rec› ords management to see how each part of the program might be changed during wartime.  The examination  revealed that many peacetime  administrative and  reporting requirements could be suspended altogether. In other areas, such as the administration of the Privacy Act and the  Freedom of Information Act,  legis› lation  has  been  proposed  to  waive  requirements in  wartime  in order to divert manpower to more vital tasks. The proposals for managing Army information in wartime have been turned over to the Army Soldier Support Center for evaluation and analysis and the development of formal doctrine.

After sophisticated IBM model 3341  computers were placed in  the  data  processing  installations  (DPI)  at  the  St.  Louis  and Baltimore Publication Centers,  it was discovered  that one com› puter was  enough to satisfy  the  requirements of both  centers, thus allowing  their consolidation  under  the  Director of Publi› cations, The Adjutant General Center (TAGGEN). On 5 January 1981  the  St.  Louis  facility  was  closed,  and  all  DPI  personnel moved to the Reserve Components Personnel and Administration Center (RCPAC). The equipment was transferred to the Enlisted Records Center at Fort Benjamin  Harrison.  The consolidation meant a net savings of  twenty-eight manpower spaces, which were reallocated  within  the directorate and T AGCEN  to meet other requirements. The total projected savings over the next five years should amount to approximately $1.2 million.

The Adjutant General Center's  Editorial Control Division, as part of  its efforts to improve the readability of  Army publications, developed  and  disseminated  DA  Pamphlet  310-20,  "Adminis› trative Publications: Action Officers Guide." The pamphlet pro› vides  guidance  for  the  preparation  and  processing of administrative publications throughout the Army. Efforts to re› duce the number of Army publications yielded the following re› sults: 465 publications were rescinded, 516 were under revision, and 151  were earmarked for consolidation. New readability pro› grams were established  at  four  major  Army  commands;  these were in addition  to  three  programs already  in  existence.  In a related development, the Micropublishing Program continued to move forward.  By  the close  of the fiscal  year,  667  publications had been converted to microfiche and others were in the process.

Proliferation of computer output microfiche (COM) contin› ued to  increase  in  fiscal year  1981  as  a  means of reducing ad› ministrative and automated data processing (ADP) systems costs and improving efficiency. There were currently 118 installations and activities producing documents using microfiche. The Com› puter Systems  Command has  improved  the software  programs used to support COM, making it more efficient and easier both for computer managers and for the customer agency.

The U.S. Army Soldier Support Center (SSC) took the lead in examining the concept of  employing commercial portable mi› crofiche viewers for  use  in deployable units. SSC procured sev› enty  Information  Design  Cube II  viewers  and  seventy Topper "46" viewers for field and garrison evaluation by selected tactical units. In coordination with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, units of the I Corps Support Command (COSCOM) were selected to use  the equipment at their fixed-site  locations as  well  as after deployment in a  major field  training exercise in fiscal year 1982.

Development of the  Army  Micrographics  Management  In› formation System (AM MIS) was begun in fiscal year 1980 for use by The Adjutant General Center's Micrographics Management Division  and  the major Army commands.  It will  contain an in› ventory of  micrographics equipment and systems. Complete AM› MIS data will not be available until fiscal year 1983. The benefits of  AMMIS will be extended to the installation level via the Army ADP Resource and Performance Management Information Sys› tem (ARPMIS).  Under development by the Computer Systems Command  (CSC)  the  ARPMIS  will  permit establishing,  main› taining, and accessing a  single integrated,  Armywide data base

for automated data processing, word processing, automated doc› umentation systems, and micrographics equipment.

The major hardware and software elements of  the Advanced Micrographic Access and Retrieval System (AMARS) were sub› stantially  completed;  however,  demonstrations  revealed  opera› tional  deficiencies  that  must  be  rectified  before  factory acceptance and delivery of  the system to the Reserve Components Personnel and Administration Center (RCPAC) in St. Louis. The issues have been analyzed in detail by Teknekron Research, Inc., the contractor.  As a  result,  modification of the AMARS has be› gun to overcome the operational defects and  to ensure full  op› erability of  the system. The pilot application wi1J  provide selected management officers with on-line access to official  military per› sonnel files of officers assigned to  them.

T AGO contracted for an inspection of  all microfiche Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) records in the Army system. The records are located at the U.S. Army Military Personnel Center, Alexandria, Virginia (active officers),  the Enlisted  Record Eval› uation Center,  Fort Benjamin Harrison (active enlisted person› nel),  and RCPAC (reserve officers and enlisted personnel).  The inspection is required by the National Archives and Records Ser› vice's (NARS)  Federal  Property  Management  Regulation (FPMR) 101-11.507.2.  The  contract,  awarded  to  the  Micro› graphic Systems Technology Corp. in Falls Church, Virginia, re› quires  reinspection of the  active  officer  microfiche  records  to determine if the information has deteriorated since the previous inspection.  It also requires an  initial  inspection of the other mi› crofiche records to establish a  basis for  future comparison.

## Administrative Management

The Installation  Integrated  Administrative Support System (IIADSS)  combines  word  processing,  internal  communications, text and data processing, photocomposition, and  micrographics into one system designed to improve offic~ productivity. As noted in last year's report, a prototype IIADSS was set up at Fort Ben› ning, Georgia,  to demonstrate that integrating current technol› ogies could  provide  more  effective  administrative support at a significantly lower cost.  The demonstration's success  led to the expansion of IIADSS, and by  the end of fiscal  year 1981  seven installations were using automated systems similar to the one at Fort Benning.  The speed  with  which  other installations  could implement their system was improved by sharing computer pro› grams and procedures used at Fort Benning.

In  1978 the  Chief of Staff requested a  major technologicaJ breakthrough to provide Army staff action officers with modern technological administrative support. The Adjutant General, un› der a project known as the Army Staff Automation Administra› tive  Support  System  (ARSTADS),  planned  to  integrate  office automation techniques into one total system for the Army staff.

The Chief of Staff, complaining that the Army staff did not even have access to a basic word processing system, directed The Adjutant General to assign immediate priority to obtaining such equipment.  This part of the  project  was  dubbed  the  Adminis› trative Systems Acceleration Plan (ASAP).

ASAP was developed by a team of T AGO administrative sys› tems experts who surveyed and evaluated the needs of  nine Army staff  agencies and 3,000 people over a twenty-month period. Dur› ing the current year the team  completed surveys  of ten  Army staff  agencies. They  recommended  procuring  480  pieces  of equipment, ranging from word processors, microcomputers, and copiers to sophisticated  laser printers and electronic micropub› lications and computerized graphics systems. In fiscal  year  1981 over 100 word processors were installed, and another 210 were on order. When completed,  ASAP  could save  as  much  as  $12 million annually.

The first full-time office to monitor the Army's effort to re› duce the administrative workload of unit commanders in the re› serve components opened in  June 1981. Established as a task force under the Reserve Components Coordination Council (RCCC), the  Reduction  in  Administrative  Workload (RAW) group sur› veyed  reserve  component  units  to  validate  unit  commanders' complaints of  excessive administration. Upon validation, the task force recommended screening DA publications to reduce admin› istrative  tasks,  addressing  specific  issues  raised  by  unit  com› manders,  and  establishing a  full-time  oversight  office  to  keep resolved issues from cropping up again. Of the more than 1000 publications  reviewed,  456  were  rescinded  from  reserve  com› ponent applicability and 516 were revised to ease administrative tasks,  while  151  had valid administrative tasks.

Between I January and 3 March 1981, 155 postage metering systems were delivered to eighty-five Army installations and ac› tivities. By June, 22.l percent of  the Army's  postage was metered.

A  Transit  Time  Information  System  for  Military  Mail (TTISMM)  is  being developed by the  Military  Postal  Service Agency to measure and analyze the flow of  military mail to, from, and within overseas areas.  TTISMM will  measure transit times over complete routes between various origins and destinations as

well as the times for movement over parts of  the complete routes. It will  provide data for  managers to establish benchmark transit times against which actual  performance can  be judged. This in turn will aid in detecting problem areas early. The Military Postal Service Agency (MPSA) had developed the basic procedures of TTISMM in coordination with  the U.S.  Postal Service. Testing of the new system will  begin in October 1981.

On 14 August  1981, the DOD General Counsel sent a draft of  proposed  Space  Available Mail (SAM)  legislation  to  the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Such legislation would give  DOD  the  discretionary  authority  to  select  transportation means for the overseas movement of  SAM mail to minimize mil› itary  mail  transportation  costs.  The increased  use  of less  costly transportation would be limited to situations in which the morale of service members would not be adversely affected.  Use would also  depend  on  the volume  of mail  to  particular foreign  desti› nations, security considerations, availability  of seaport facilities, frequency of  ship sailings, and costs associated with in-transit mail processing and overland transportation costs. The use of  cheaper transportation for overseas movement of SAM would be deter› mined on  a  country-by-country  basis  in  coordination  with  the affected military service and appropriate field commanders.

## 10. Logistics

Readiness remained the key issue for Army logisticians during fiscal year  1981.  Could  they,  inquired  Lt.  Gen.  Richard H. Thompson, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics since August 1981,  improve their "readiness to logistically  support mobiliza› tion and deployment of the Total Army and to sustain it indef› initely  in  any  war  it  may  have  to  fight"?  General  Thompson clearly thought that the Army had turned a  corner by  the end of  the fiscal year. It had over the past several years better defined the problem and in the process developed the analytical tools that would permit it to better manage its supplies and equipment in the future. Still, shortages persisted, and the need to integrate a new  generation of equipment that was just beginning to  reach the  troops  could  only  exacerbate  the  situation.  Nowhere  were the imponderables and shortages of Army logistics better high› lighted  than  in  the  support  provided  the  Army's forward  de› ployed forces.

## Support of Forward Deployed Forces

Forward deployed forces are those combat units and the an› cillary  combat  support  and  combat  service  support  (CS-CSS) units stationed outside the continental  United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  They include the  four divisions,  four separate  bri› gades, and two armored cavalry regiments stationed in  Europ~, the 2d Infantry Division in Korea, the 172d Infantry Brigade in Alaska, and the 193d Infantry Brigade in Panama. Although Gen› eral  Edward C.  Meyer  redirected  the  Army's attention  toward the possibility of war outside of Europe shortly after becoming Chief of Staff in June 1979, in  1981  the size of U.S.  forces sta› tioned on the continent and the accelerating Soviet buildup dic› tated  that  the  Army  expend  the  bulk  of its  logistic  effort  on preparing for  combat in  this  theater.  The  effort  consisted  of operational projects, the pre-positioning of war reserve materiel stocks,  pre-positioned  materiel  configured  to  unit  sets (POM› CUS), and the negotiation of  agreements with the host countries to provide some degree of  assistance through either cash outlays or supplies  to  U.S.  forces  stationed  within  their  borders.  The principles  guiding these  labors  in  Europe received  an  authori-

tative statement in  the U.S.  Army Training and Doctrine Com› mand (TRADOC) Pamphlet 525-12,  "Logistics Operations  in the Communications Zone" (COMMZ),  30 June 1981.

In  May  1978  the Vice  Chief of Staff of the Army,  General Walter T. Kerwin, approved twenty-one operational concepts de› signed to overcome gaps in logistics  policy,  doctrine, and plan› ning. The U.S.  Army  Logistics  Center (LOGCEN) selected ten of the twenty-one on  which there  was  general  agreement throughout the Army and which were not likely to change in the foreseeable  future.  TRADOC published  these  ten concepts  in the  form  of Pamphlet 525-12. At the same time LOGCEN ob› tained comments on the other eleven,  which  it hoped  to  have ready for publication during fiscal  1982.

During fiscal  year 1981  the Army  maintained forty-two  op› erational projects valued at $990 million  to support worldwide Army operational and contingency  plans.  The projects,  which included  both  pre-positioned  and  non-pre-positioned  materiel, are intended to provide initial support to Army units in combat above and beyond current materiel authorizations. While an im› proved maintenance program permitted upgrading the condition of  the supplies on hand, lack of  funding prevented increasing the amount of equipment.

Pre-positioned war reserve materiel stocks, in contrast to the supplies in operational projects, are intended to sustain units once they are committed to combat. The Army acquires the reserve materiel in peacetime and stockpiles it overseas to reduce initial wartime transportation requirements and in-transit losses and to ensure that Army forces can fight until resupply arrives from the United States.  Stocks pre-positioned  in  Europe and  Korea  will provide immediate logistical support to forward deployed units and to reinforcing U.S.,  NATO, and Korean  units in the event of  war. Supplies pre-positioned in stateside depots support Army elements of the  Rapid Deployment Force.  During  1981  inade› quate funding allowed only a minimal increase in the size of  these stocks,  which  currently  are  not  enough  to  sustain  the  intense activity  demanded  in  modern  warfare.  In  Europe  the  lack  of warehouses  made it  necessary  to store equipment in  the  open, thereby increasing maintenance costs.  To decrease the deterio› ration of wheeled vehicles in  the NATO war reserve stocks and at the same time enhance the readiness of  forward deployed units in  Europe,  USAREUR  established  a  rotation  program  to  ex› change  low-mileage  wheeled  vehicles  in  the  war  reserves  with

high-mileage vehicles in the forward units. During 1981, the Of› fice  of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Logistics  (ODCSLOG) re› vised  the  regulation dealing with  reserve stocks,  AR  11-11, to clarify  responsibilities  of Army  staff agencies  and  major  com› mands. At the same time the U.S.  Army Materiel  Development and  Readiness  Command  (DARCOM)  revised  the  companion regulation AR 710-1. ODSCLOG scheduled these revisions for publication  early in 1982. 0 DCSLOG also sponsored conferences on war reserves-for Europe in August 1981 and for the Pacific in September 1981.  Attended by representatives of the overseas commands, the meetings provided a forum for identifying prob› lems of common concern and initiating actions to correct them.

The Army has had three stockpiles of  pre-positioned materiel configured to unit sets (POMCUS) in Europe for over ten years. In an emergency the troops of  three divisions would fly to Europe and receive their equipment there. Changes in authorized as well as the severe Armywide equipment shortage has meant that the amount of equipment in  the sets has never reached targeted lev› els. The decision by the Carter administration to fill the sets with equipment withdrawn from units in the United States in addition to the traditional method, purchase, produced a beneficial result in fiscal year 1981. The  amount of  equipment in place came closer to the goals than ever before. In addition, the repair parts pro› gram for POMCUS improved more than in any other year. Un› fortunately,  this  policy reduced the flexibility of Army  units  in the  continental  United  States,  which  could  only deploy at  full strength to Europe. Crises in other parts of  the world would result in  an  expeditionary  force  either  undermanned  or  undere› quipped.  The  policy  also  slowed  training,  particularly  for  the reserve  components.  Troops  had  to  double-up  on  equipment, thus lengthening the training time and increasing maintenance expenditures at a time when spare parts were also in short supply. The Reagan administration reversed the policy shortly after tak› ing office,  but this still  left the problem qf filling the POMCUS to authorized supply levels and reequipping the CONUS units. Production lead-time  was  such  that even  if the  Department of the  Army  requested  the  funds  for  replacing all  the withdrawn equipment, valued at $107  million,  in  the fiscal  1982 budget› which  it did not-the new equipment would not reach the units until fiscal  years  1984 and  1985.

The  United  States  government  had  agreed  to  establish  a fourth division set (DS) in Europe by the end of  December 1980

and two more by the end of 1982 provided that NATO paid all construction  costs  and  that  the  host  nations supplied  the  sites. The warehouses for DS 4 were 96 percent complete by December 1980,  but  NATO did not expect  the loading ramps and main› tenance  facilities  to  be  done  until  December  1981.  Substantial quantities of  equipment began arriving at the Moenchengladbach site in November 1980 and were stored with little delay, because construction  there was on  time.  Delays  in  completing the  Her› ongen  facilities,  however,  caused  about  8  percent  of all  DS 4 equipment to  be stored outside at the end of December  1980 and  12 percent by  1 April  1981. Completion of DS 5 and DS 6 is  not scheduled  until  1984,  and  the  Army  does  not intend  to ship equipment to them until all  construction is  finished.  When fully  implemented,  POMCUS will  consist of seven  major pack› ages:  the six division sets and a  package of combat support and combat service support (CS-CSS) units designed to supplement the inadequate number of CS and CSS units available to support the Army divisions and brigades already stationed in Central Eu› rope.  Reserve units deploying from CONUS will have to fill  this gap and prepare the POMCUS equipment for distribution to the divisions flying in  from  the United States.

POMCUS makes sense only if the troops can deploy to Eu› rope, receive their equipment, and move to their battle positions before hostilities begin. (The warehouses make tempting targets for a numerically superior Soviet Air Force.) The U.S. Air Force cannot move enough troops to Europe to man the equipment in the existing divisional sets within a "prudent" time following the start of mobilization. The lack of  airlift at this time means that, in  General  Meyer's phrase,  Army  policy  is  "out of sync."  Fast sealift  will  provide  an  interim  solution,  although once  airlift  is sufficient, sealift will  simply  increase the number of reinforcing divisions.  During 1981  the Army began preparing for this long› term goal. DCSLOG issued a new authorization document which changed the composition of DS 2 and OS 3, previously designed to  support  heavy  divisions.  The  Chief of Staff intends  to  use divisions from  the West Coast and  the  Midwest for  POMCUS, thus freeing units on the East and Gulf Coasts for redeployment using fast sealif  t.

Currently there are no Army aircraft included in POMCUS. In  December 1980 General John W.  Vessey,  the Vice Chief of Staff,  Army,  approved  a  plan  to  test  the  feasibility  of placing selected aircraft in  POMCUS in humidity-controlled storage for

a certain period of  time. DCSLOG planned to begin the test with fourteen fully modernized AH-1S Cobra TOW helicopters, two platoons  with  seven  aircraft each.  DARCOM,  working in  con› junction with the 21st Support Command, will place the aircraft in storage  in January  1982.  After six  months they will  remove one platoon and fly  and test-fire the aircraft to establish the im› pact of  storage on the time, man-hours, and resources needed to make  them  fully  operational.  DARCOM and  the  21st Support Command will then return the aircraft to storage. They will keep the second platoon in  storage for one year and then repeat the same procedure to establish the impact oflong-term storage. The 21st Support Command will  then issue the second platoon to a USAREUR unit. DARCOM will collect data on reliability, avail› ability, and maintainability (RAM) for six months to further eval› uate the total effect of this year-long storage.  Upon completion of the  DARCOM study,  the Department of the Army  will  de› termine the feasibility  of placing aircraft in POMCUS and the number and types that should be so deployed.

Host nation support (HNS), which is discussed in Chapter 3, is  one of the  means-along with operational projects,  pre-posi› tioned war reserve materiel stocks, and POMCUS-by which the Army seeks to achieve the  total  logistics  support  capability  re› quired by  U.S.  combat forces in  time of war.  The Office of  the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) formed an interagency HNS working group in February 1981 under the auspices and general guidance of its own  HNS Advisory Group.  Composed of representatives of OSD, the Office of the  Joint Chiefs of  Staff (OJCS), the State Department, the relevant commanders in chief, and the intelli› gence  community,  the working group's broad objective  was  to develop support requirements for the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) and obtain HNS for RDF contingencies. The first priority was  to  acquire  host  nation  support  for  the  current  RDF;  the second priority was  to obtain HNS for an expanded RDF.  The working group divided  into four  subgroups which  based  their activities on group terms of  reference and a fifteen-point agenda.

Efforts continued during 1981  to obtain support agreements on lines of  communications (LOC) with the nations of  the NATO northern and southern regions. The U.S. signed umbrella, gen› eral, and technical agreements with Denmark, Norway, and Italy. OSD suspended dialogue with Turkey and Greece for the time being.  (LOC agreements fall  into  four  general categories:  um› brella,  general  or general  technical,  technical  or technical  an-

nexes,  and joint  logistic  support  plans  ULSPs].  The  primary difference between them is in degree of  specificity, with umbrella agreements consisting of  general statements of principle and the others providing progressively  more detail. JLSPs are very de› tailed;  they would,  for example, provide for the movement of a specific  number  of short  tons  of supply  from  one  location  to another on a  certain day after the commencement of mobiliza› tion.)

Korean HNS, which has existed for many years in practice if not in name primarily through agreements between the U.S. ser› vices and their counterparts in the Republic of  Korea, continued to exemplify allied cooperation during fiscal year 1981. The for› mal Combined Defense improvement Projects (CDIP) Program, begun  at  the  12th  Security  Consultative  Meeting  in  October 1979, contains all elements of support normally included in host nation support.

Japan HNS to U.S. forces there includes participation in the Relocation  Construction  Program (RCP) and the  Facilities  Im› provement  Program (FIP). The RCP allows  the Japanese  gov› ernment to relocate U.S.  military  facilities  in  order to  use  the scarce real  estate for development.  In return the Japanese gov› ernment constructs new facilities for the displaced service func› tions. The result is a consolidation of  U.S. bases and a reduction in  operating costs.  The FIP  is  a  cost-sharing  arrangement whereby  the Japanese  government helps  offset  the cost to  the United States of maintaining forces  in Japan by  funding  troop housing and maintenance facilities. The FIP now extends over a three-year  budget  cycle,  an  arrangement  that  facilitates  long› range planning.

Aviation contract maintenance in Europe provides a  perfect example of the difficulties inherent in international support for the Army logistics system. During the 23d U .S.-German Logistic Staff Talks  in  November  1979,  the  Germans  proposed  the  es› tablishment of a  helicopter  maintenance capability within  Ger› man industry which could be expanded in wartime. The Germans requested  that  the  Army  systematically  determine  the  mainte› nance  requirements  of U.S.  forces  in  Europe and develop  ap› propriate  procedures  that  would  allow  German  contractors  to participate.  The Army concluded that contracting through the Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR) provided the only avail› able mechanism for placing work with German industries.  The U.S. Army Troop Support and Aviation Materiel Readiness Com-

mand (TSAR  COM) decided that there was not enough of  a work› load to establish a capability for major overhaul of  aircraft within German industry in competition with in-house maintenance de› pots in the U.S. It  recommended that a contract involving aircraft condition evaluation, flight safety inspections, and installation of modification kits could be structured for international competi› tion. Consequently DARCOM directed TSARCOM to issue such a  contract in July or August 1980 to be awarded by  December 1980.  TSARCOM also offered assistance to German industries that wanted to have their names added to the bidder's list.

As  of 30 September 1981  the TSARCOM bidder's list con› tained about forty names, including six German firms and a few U .S.-based  firms  with  subsidiaries  in  Germany.  As  a  result  of technical and administrative difficulties, issuance of  the proposed solicitation slipped from July or August 1980 to March 1981. In the interim TSARCOM restructured the proposal as a  basic or› dering agreement with an initial workload of  5,000 to 6,000 man› hours.  TSARCOM  issued  this  request  for  proposal  (RFP)  in March  1981  and received solicitations from one  U.S.  and  two German firms in  April  1981. The command withdrew the RFP in July because of  excessively high bids and a perceived need for further detailed evaluation of USAREUR aviation maintenance requirements.  In that same  month Joseph  P.  Cribbins,  Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Logistics,  visited Ger› many to review and establish the scope of aviation maintenance work  generated  in  USAREUR  that  exceeded  its  capabilities. USAREUR estimated  this  total  workload  at 60,000 to 75,000 man-hours per year exclusive of  any significant depot-level work. In August 1981 USAREUR and TSARCOM drafted a new state› ment of maintenance  work  needs and  began  preparing a  new RFP, scheduled for issue during fiscal  year  1982.

The problems with  aviation  maintenance or the strains en› demic to  the  host nation  relationship  pale  beside  the  fact  that the five division equivalents which the Army maintains in Europe cannot  be  sustained  in  combat  without  reinforcement  from CON  US before the outbreak of  war. This situation resulted from an attempt to  improve the "teeth-to-tail"  ratio,  the proportion of combat units to combat support and combat service support units, in Europe dating from the mid-1960s. Some 75 percent of all CS-CSS units are in the reserves, and as General Robert M. Shoemaker,  the  commander  of U.S.  Army  Forces  Command (FORSCOM), testified to the Senate Committee on Armed Ser-

vices in  February  1981,  their level of readiness  was  not as  high as  the Army desired.  In a  crisis the President would confront a genuine  dilemma.  If he did  not reinforce  USAREUR it might be "use(d) up in combat," to borrow the words of  its commander, "because its replenishment, its sustained effectiveness, cannot be guaranteed."  If the President did reinforce,  he risked touching off the very conflict that he hoped to avoid. The example of the catastrophe of  1914 would ensure that considerable political pres› sure and a respectable intellectual rationale would exist for doing nothing. As early as 1979 the Department of  the Army concluded that the reduction of CS-CSS units had gone too far in Europe. Then and in subsequent years the department had programmed additional combat support and combat service support units to replace a percentage of those previously allocated to the reserve components. In each year,  1981  included, the Army did not re› ceive sufficient funds to do so.

While Europe remained the focus of Army planning during the fiscal  year, the Middle  East received  increased attention as a possible  theater of operations, as  it  has  every  year since  1973. One difficulty of operating in such regions is  the lack of  potable water.  A  250,000-man  force,  for  example,  would  require  ap› proximately five million gallons of  water each day.  Until recently, the Army had failed to address this problem adequately.  It was capable  of drilling  wells  and  filtering  water,  but  it  lacked  the equipment to treat saltwater, brackish water, or water contami› nated  by  chemicals.  In  September  1980  OSD  gave  the  Army responsibility  for  developing joint water doctrine  and  for sup› plying water to the other services during joint operations. The Department of the  Army designated water supply as  a  combat service support function,  with  Army staff management respon› sibility  assigned  to  the  Deputy Chief of Staff for  Logistics  and functional  responsibility  delegated  to  the  U.S.  Army  Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). TRADOC designated the U.S.  Army Logistics Center as its executive agent for water re› sources and transferred responsibility  tor  water supply combat developments from  the  Engineer School  to the Quartermaster School. The Quartermaster School began to develop long-term, all-environment  water support concepts,  doctri~e,  and  organi› zations.  At the end of the year there were plans to transfer the responsibility  for  training  development as  well  as  the  training itself to the Quartermaster School.

Meanwhile,  the  Logistics  Center addressed  the problem of

near-term  support  in  arid  environments,  trying  to  determine what changes would help correct the worst deficiencies in existing doctrine,  organizations,  and  equipment as  quickly  as  possible. The results were published as TRADOC Pamphlet 525-11,  June 1981.

## Logistics Planning and Management

While logistics planning and management did not receive the public attention given the quality and quantity of  logistic support to USAREUR, ultimately the former had a  tremendous impact upon the latter. In 1981 initiatives in logistics planning and man› agement centered on four areas:  review  of the entire  logistics system; development of better criteria to judge the readiness of units and weapons; planning to ensure adequate supply and main› tenance for major items of  equipment which the Army intended to  field  in  the future;  and  changes  in  the  training and  career patterns of logistics specialists.

The Army completed "Study of  Army Logistics-1981" dur› ing  the  fiscal  year,  which  ended  on  30  September  1981.  The Brown Board, which completed its work in  1965, had provided the last comprehensive study of the Army logistics system. The Besson Board in 1969 had focused on support for Southeast Asia. Concern over the lack  of a  recent study came to a  head at the 1980 Commanders'  Conference. Injanuary 1981 General Meyer directed General John R.  Guthrie, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Materiel, Readiness, and Development Command, to prepare  "a foxhole-to-factory"  study  on  Army  logistics.  Com› pleted in  August,  the  study contained some  275  recommenda› tions dealing with all aspects of the logistics system, with special emphasis on the industrial base. General Meyer assigned respon› sibility  for  coordinating the assessment of the study to General Thompson, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (DCSLOG). General  Thompson  formed  a  Logistics  Study  81  Assessment Team within ODCSLOG to oversee the review by the Army staff and  to keep track of the implementation of adopted proposals. The Army put the first approved changes into effect in Septem› ber.

While the "Study of  Army Logistics-1981" sought to define the entire logistical system and improve its functioning by better relating its  parts to  the whole,  the ODCSLOG pursued several limited reforms,  the cumulative effect of which  was to improve markedly  the  managerial  tools  available  to  direct  the  logistics

effort.  These  initiatives  involved  a  revision  of DCSLOG Regu› lation  701-2,  "Logistics  Plans-Direction  for  Army  Logistics (DIALOG)," a change in the method of making materiel readi› ness reports to Congress, the automation of Department of the Army records, the approval  of temporary loans to  active  units from war reserves and operational projects, and  the  expansion of the pacing item reporting system.

DIALOG, an outgrowth of the "Executive Summary of the Army Logistics Master Plan," last published in 1973, is an annual action plan for Army logistics, which sketches significant accom› plishments of the preceding year,  lists total Army goals, outlines the  logistics  goals designed to support those of the Army,  and enumerates areas of concentration within each logistic objective designed to answer the question: "Where are we going?"  It then gives specific actions to implement each of these objectives and the dates by which the Army plans to accomplish them. Largely because  of the  personal interest  of Lt.  Gen.  Arthur J.  Gregg, who  was  the  DCSLOG  until  his  retirement  in July  1981, ODCSLOG reviewed the 1980 edition of DIALOG to make the objectives  more  definite,  more  measurable,  clearer,  and  more concise.  The office published these changes in DCSLOG Regu› lation 701-2 on 6 October 1980 and in Department of  the Army Pamphlet 701- 1 in January 1981. ODCSLOG encouraged each major Army command to develop its own supporting objectives to improve logistics further.

The Office  of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for  Man› power,  Reserve  Affairs,  and  Logistics  (OASD  MRA&amp;L)  made significant changes  in  the  format  and  content  of the  Materiel Readiness Report to Congress during fiscal year 1981. The office hoped the changes would give the legislators a  better picture of actual  conditions  within  the  Department  of Defense  and  the Army. In line with this reform, the Office, Deputy Chief  of  Staff for Logistics (ODCSLOG) attempted to tie equipment readiness to  budget appropriations.  Although  not  totally  successful,  the effort was an improvement over previous attempts, which quickly became apparent when the Reagan administration proposed the fiscal  year  1981  supplemental and  the  fiscal  year  1982 amend› ments to previous budget bills.  For the first time the Army tried to  define  how  much  additional  readiness  the  increased  appro› priations would buy.

Throughout the year, various agencies on the Army staff  and in the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) evaluated several

models under development to relate resources to readiness. The models used one of two basic approaches or some combination of both. The first approach attempted to relate specific  system readiness  to appropriations.  It appeared to have a  more direct relationship to the appropriation process within the Department of Defense, the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), and might have some validity in predicting the readiness of small units when the system involved was in fact their pacing item.  The other approach,  aimed at major combat units,  tried to relate unit readiness to appropriations. At the end of  the fiscal year  the RAND Corporation  was  still  working  on  the  second approach.

A  pacing item is a  major weapons system, such as a  tank or an aircraft, that is central to an organization's  ability to perform its assigned mission.  Because these items are critical to the level of readiness expected of a  unit,  the quantity on hand and their condition are subject to continuous monitoring and management at all  levels  of command.  During fiscal  year  1981,  ODCSLOG expanded pacing item reporting to include selected combat ser› vice  support  units,  thus  marking  the first  time  that  the  Army included logistics units in  the pacing item system.

In another equipment-monitoring effort, General Gregg ap› proved  the  conversion  of the  manual  information system  that recorded equipment loans made from the war reserves and op› erational  projects  to  active  units-a set  of three-by-five  cards maintained in the Directorate of  Supply and Maintenance-to a computer system capable of generating semiannual lists of out› standing loans.  The new method produced immediate  results. ODCSLOG was able to reduce the amount of  equipment on loan from $86 million worth in December 1980 to $45 million worth in September 1981. During the same period, the office reduced the total value of overdue loans from $52 million to less than $9 million, an 83-percent improvement. '

ODCSLOG served  two  roles  in  the  Commercial  Activities (CA) Program, described in Chapter 9.  It is  the Army staff pro› ponent for 48 percent of 179 generic functional areas designated as Army CA functions; and it is responsible for two field operating agencies vitally involved in the program-the U.S. Army Troop Support Agency at Fort Lee,  Virginia, and the U.S.  Army Lo› gistics Evaluation Agency at New Cumberland, Pennsylvania.  In 1981  ODCSLOG reviewed approximately forty-five Commercial Activities Proposed Action Summaries (CPAS), which provide the

information needed to assess the feasibility of contract perform› ance.

ODCSLOG, working in conjunction with several other agen› cies,  developed  and  published  the  "Useful  Life  and  Residual Value Table" to simplify the computation of  general and admin› istration  (G&amp;A)  expenses,  an integral  part of a  commercial  ac› tivities cost study.  The table is a single reference document that gives all  necessary information about the useful life and residual value of  all items for which the Army must compute depreciation.

On  I  July  1981  the  Army  activated  the  National  Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California. It was the first installation considered for contract operation of  all base operation functions in which contractors were not performing any duties at the time the contract was  awarded.  After a  review  of industry bids and in-house costs, FORSCOM awarded a contract to Boeing Services International on 1 July 1981. FORSCOM calculated that the sav› ings to the government would amount to $6.2 million annually, 19  percent lower than the original estimate. The contractor be› gan full-scale  operation on 1 October 1981.

The Defense  Retail  lnterservice  Support  (DRIS)  Program provides commanders with a  means of improving  retail  opera› tions by acquiring support from other military services and de› fense  agencies  through  interservice  agreements.  During  fiscal year 1981, the Department of Defense DRIS data bank recorded approximately  2,330  agreements  in  which  the  Army  provided support valued  at  more  than  $150  million.  Through  another 1,120 agreements the Army received support valued at $90 mil› lion  from  other services and agencies.  The program  has  expe› rienced  continuous  annual  growth  over  the  past  decade  as reflected  in  the number of agreements and the dollar value of the support provided.  ODCSLOG anticipates that the program will  continue to grow.  In  March  1981  the  Deputy Secretary of Defense placed additional emphasis on DRIS when he assigned each  service  an  annual  savings  target  of $10  million  for  fiscal years 1983 through 1987. ODCSLOG apportioned a share of  the Army savings target to each major command. The Program Ob› jective Memorandum (POM) for the 1983-1987 period reflected the new figures.

Joint Interservice  Resource Study  Groups (JIRSG)  received continued  attention  within  the  DRIS  program.  In  support  of DOD's DRIS plan for fiscal years 1979-1983, sixty-sevenJIRSGs had been established  by  1981  to  explore  the  possibility  of in-

creased  interservice support where there were geographic con› centrations  of DOD  activities.  The  study  groups  determined capabilities and requirements in all  101  DRIS categories of  sup› port services.  Each  group  was  chaired  by  a  full  colonel  or his naval  or civilian equivalent. Their work was scheduled for com› pletion  in  fiscal  year  1983.  Regular process reports to the ASD (MRA&amp;L) and the military services as well as the draft report of a special audit by the Defense Audit Service (DAS) submitted in July 1981  indicated that theJIRSG procedure had failed to pro› duce  any  significant  consolidation  of support  capabilities. ODCSLOG recommended an alternative approach to theJIRSGs in  September 1981, in  which OSD would select two geographic areas  that showed  the greatest potential  for  base support con› solidation.  The department and the services would concentrate all  efforts on  the two geographic areas. The results would allow OSD to calculate more accurately the savings deriving from sup› port consolidation in  less  promising geographic areas.

In July  1981  ODCSLOG recommended that Headquarters, Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA),  keep a  record of interservice support agreements at the Defense Logistics Services Center, an action that would eliminate the need for the military services to keep such records. DLA agreed. Implementation will begin dur› ing fiscal  year  1982.

The "Study of Army Logistics-1981,"  the reforms of the management  information  system  such  as  the  1981  revision  of DIALOG, the Commercial Activities (CA) Program, and the De› fense Retail  lnterservice Support Program all dealt with the en› tire Army logistics system. At the same time ODCSLOG prepared plans  which  focused  on  areas  within  the  total  system.  For  ex› ample,  before  the  Army  fielded  a  major  item  of equipment in 1981,  ODCSLOG prepared a  detailed  plan  covering  its  distri› bution,  supply,  and  maintenance  and  the  monitoring  of these activities.  Thus the execution of the objectives of ODCSLOG's five-ton-truck study, discussed in the Department of  the  Army His› torical Summary  for Fiscal Year 1980, began in 1981. The U.S. Army Tank Automotive  Command (TACOM)  carried out the distri› bution plan included in the staff study.  ODCSLOG expected the command  to complete deliveries  of the  trucks purchased  with fiscal  year 1981 funds by July l 983. At the end of  the fiscal  year the Department of the Army was reviewing a TACOM plan for procuring  18,000  five-ton  trucks  in  fiscal  years  1982  through

1987 with deliveries stretching from August 1983 through Sep› tember 1988.

The new five-ton  truck presented a fairly simple problem for logistics planners. It  was simply an improved version of  a standard item of  equipment which could be purchased "off  the shelf." The organizations and the men necessary to man, maintain, and sus› tain  the  trucks  already  existed,  and  the  amount  of retraining required was minimal.

The same could not be said for the division air defense (Dl› VAD) gun, for which  the Department of the Army pursued an innovative acquisition strategy  during  1981.  Until  recently the standard Army development cycle consisted of three phases. In the concept phase DAR  COM would develop a statement of what the Army required. In response, interested manufacturers would prepare engineering drawings and perhaps build a prototype. On the basis  of these submissions DARCOM  would select the pro› posal which appeared most feasible and award a contract for full› scale  engineering development,  the second phase  of the  cycle. The contractor would build three to five  prototypes which  the Army would  review  and  make  recommendations  for  improve› ment.  Only  if satisfied  with  the  results  and  if the  original  re› quirement still  existed  would  the  Army  award  a  full-scale production contract, the third phase of the cycle.

The  DIVAD  gun  went  through  a  two-phase  development cycle.  In  the first,  the  Army  prepared a  general  description of what it wanted and then allowed two contractors complete free› dom to design and build prototypes. The only restriction on their independence was  that all components had to be "off the shelf" with a history of reliable service. In May 1981 a source selection board chose Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation to act as  the production contractor.  This selection  marked the beginning of  phase two, which involved maturation ("debugging" the prototype) and initial production.

In the standard development cycle,  the contractor validated logistic planning during phase two, when he built the prototypes. The contractor provided the information  needed to determine ammunition,  spare  parts,  tools,  maintenance  manuals,  and  the personnel  and special  training  required  to  field,  operate,  and repair the weapon. Once the contractor accomplished these pre› liminaries,  the project manager (PM), who had direct access  to the commanding general of DARCOM and the Secretary of the Army, initiated planning. Only then could the appropriate Army

commands  and  agencies  begin  to  accumulate  the  men,  infor› mation, and materiel needed when ODCSLOG actually deployed the weapons  to the units in the field.  To follow  the same  pro› cedure for the DIVAD gun would have added unnecessarily to the expense. The quite different prototypes would have required radically different logistical support systems, and in the end the Army would use only one. Consequently, the Army expected only minimal logistic support planning and execution until after the selection of the production contractor. Planning which had pre› viously taken two cycles  to complete was now compressed into one and presented a unique challenge to logisticians. The project manager began logistics planning in conjunction with Ford Aer› ospace in May  1981.

The Army had devised the new procurement procedure in response to congressional concern about the length of time re› quired to develop  a  new  weapon.  The service  intended to  use the new procedure selectively in place of the three-phase cycle. DARCOM would chose weapons for accelerated development on a  case-by-case  basis.  The  DIVAD  gun represented  the  Army's first experience with the new system; the multiple launch rocket system  (MLRS)  was  the  second.  Although  it  progressed  more quickly than the DIVAD gun, MLRS was an even greater head› ache to  logistics  planners.  The system  was  an  "add-on"  to the force.  It replaced no existing weapons;  it was  entirely new.  All logistics requirements for  the MLRS were additions to existing requirements.  Moreover, MLRS used  a  "shoot-and-scoot"  op› erational  technique,  that  is,  it  moved  to  a  new  position  after launching a  missile  salvo.  This method of employment required the development of flexible ammunition resupply practices and procedures to ensure  that the empty launcher and the rockets arrived at the same place at the same time. The large size of the rockets  and  the  rapid  rate  of fire  of the  launcher  generated unique ammunition shipment, handling, and storage considera› tions. The project manager coordinated all logistics planning by the contractor and all the Army agencies involved during 1981. The logistics system would be ready to allow the weapon to be fielded on schedule during fiscal  year 1983.

During  1981,  the  Army  had  an  improved  TOW  (tube› launched,  optically  tracked,  wire-guided)  antitank  missile,  des› ignated TOW 2, under development. A test and evaluation com› mittee  from  DARCOM  conducted  a  physical  tear-down  and maintenance evaluation (PTME) to determine the adequacy of.

repair tools, test equipment, and operator and maintenance skills. The PTME revealed only  minor shortcomings.  In  September 1981  the Department of the Army conducted a  general officer in-process  review  which  concluded that the TOW  2  should be classified  as  a  standard  item  of equipment.  This  would  enable DARCOM to begin work in fiscal  year 1982 on parts catalogues and maintenance  training manuals and  would also  allow  DAR› COM to apply fiscal year 1981 and 1982 appropriations toward modifying the basic TOW launchers to accept the TOW 2.  At the end of  fiscal year 1981, initiation of  these actions awaited the approval of the PTME conclusions by the Deputy Chief of  Staff for  Research,  Development,  and  Acquisition  (DCSRDA).  He withheld his decision pending completion of  a U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) study on the best procurement strategy› competitive  versus sole source.  In  contrast  to MLRS, TOW 2 will present few  problems to logistics planners because the exist› ing TOW logistics system will  support it with only slight modi› fication.

Army Regulation  750-40, "Missile  Materiel  Readiness  Re› port," continued to provide an excellent source of management information for use at MICOM, DARCOM, and the Department of the Army during 1981. After almost two years of operation, the report had proven simple to prepare and  had  gained wide acceptance in the field.  Visits by The Inspector General and by Command Logistics Review Teams validated the accuracy of the data generated in the field. Injune 1981, ODCSLOG conducted a  special  in-process  review of the regulation and  the reporting procedures, which resulted in a recommendation to further sim› plify  preparation in  the field.  The change promised to increase the usefulness of the report at headquarters by adding existing missile  systems  not yet  covered  by  the  report and  new  ones as the  Army  fielded  them.  At  the  end  of September 1981 ODCSLOG was drafting a revised regulation.

Logistics  planning  encompassed not only  materiel  but also people.  Efforts  by  ODCSLOG to  improve enlisted and officer professional development continued throughout the fiscal  year. The  revitalized  Noncommissioned  Officer  Logistics  Program (NCOLP) began to produce tangible results. The Resource Man› agement Division in ODCSLOG made some 700 changes in the NCOLP documentation system which, when combined with the concomitant creation  of major command and CONUS-installa› tion NCO  LP staff monitors, led to a better utilization of  soldiers

in  the  program.  Participation  by  noncommissioned  officers  in› creased to 90 percent of authorized levels.

In other personnel actions ODCSLOG provided information and assistance  to TRADOC, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel  (ODCSPER), and  the Office of the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Operations and Plans (ODCSOPS) in four areas: evaluation of primary and  basic  technical courses  to determine the adequacy of  training; the Women in the Army Policy Review Group to study the impact of  pregnancy and female authorization levels on readiness;  the  Manning System Task Force evaluation of  the new rotation system and regimental affiliation; and a review of specialty designations needed  to support the fielding of new systems. ODCSLOG also became the main coordination point for logistic specialties on the Army staff. On 1 October 1980 General Meyer directed  that Army schools become  the  proponents for changes in  military occupation specialties (MOSs) falling within their areas of expertise.  ODCSLOG sent representatives to the proponency meetings on logistics specialties held at the various logistics schools. ODCSLOG conducted proponent reviews of  the Logistic Executive Development Course (LEDC) and the Direc› torate of Industrial Operations Course (DIOC),  which  resulted in several improvements in their content. ODCSLOG also spon› sored  the establishment of additional specialty  training and  lo› gistics precommand courses. These latter courses were designed for lieutenant colonels and colonels slated to command support battalions and divisional support commands.

In  February  1981  General  Vessey,  the  Vice  Chief of Staff, approved the Army Aviation Maintenance Career Management Field 67 Study for implementation by TRADOC. TRADOC will revise the Career Management Field-Military Occupational Spe› cialties (CMF-MOS) structure, the standards of grade authori› zation (SGA), the grade and skill level authorizations, all aviation maintenance training programs,  and the appropriate incentives to recruit, train, and retain qualified soldiers in the aviation main› tenance  program.  The Department of the  Army  Steering Ad› visory Group, chaired by the Special Assistant to the DCSLOG, will  remain ad hoc during fiscal  year 1982 and will  monitor the implementation of the study.

## Computer Applications

The application of  automated data processing systems (ADPS) to  logistics  provides  the  possibility  of establishing  a  highly  re-

sponsive,  decentralized  organization. The wide dissemination of detailed information about the amount and condition of equip› ment and supplies in units and at installations allows higher head› quarters to anticipate the needs of lower echelons more rapidly and  accurately.  Paradoxically,  having  such information  gives higher echelons the illusion that they have a complete picture of field conditions, thus creating the psychological precondition for imposing rigid and overcentralized direction.  What kind of lo› gistics system would eventually result from these conflicting im› pulses remained problematic in  fiscal  year  1981.  As  in  previous years,  the  Army's goals  remained  to achieve  "state-of-the-art" status in both hardware and software-an exceedingly ambitious goal  given  the rapid advances  in  the  computer field,  the  high costs,  and  the  vagaries  of the  one-year  budget  cycle.  In  1981, work on computer applications extended throughout the logistics hierarchy,  from  ODCSLOG down to  the facilities  on  the  post from  which  troops drew their equipment and clothing.

The Automation Management Office (AMO) completed and published  the  ODCSLOG  Automation  Plan  (DAP), which  is  a four-phase program that will  result in an automated information processing system for  ODCSLOG.  Implementation of the four major recommendations for automation are well under way:  (1) reorganization  of word  processing  support (phase  I  of the  au› tomation plan), (2)  development of a  program to monitor proj› ects, (3) development of a program to track work on PPBS, and (4) establishment of  a secure data link between the Logistics Eval› uation  Agency  (LEA)  at New  Cumberland,  Pennsylvania,  and ODCSLOG.

The AMO study focused on only one office in  the logistics system,  albeit a  very important one.  Work on  the  Total Army Equipment  Distribution  Program  (T  AEDP),  in  contrast,  con› cerned one element of the entire system. TAEDP is a collection of  computer-generated information that'projects Class VII (ma› jor equipment)  end  items,  such  as  tanks,  artillery,  helicopters, and so forth, at the battalion level for the current year, the budget year, and the five years of  the Program Objective Memorandum (POM).  ODCSLOG and  the  Depot  Systems  Command  (DES› COM) completed worldwide implementation of TAEDP during November  and  December  1980.  They  also  added  the  phased equipment modernization (PEM) module to TAEDP, which per› mits  the  accurate  tracking of new  pieces  of equipment as  they come into the Army inventory. Under the old system, the Army

changed the TO  Es of  similar units throughout the service on the same day whether or  not  enough equipment was available to outfit all of  them. In fact, it rarely was. TAEDP-PEM permits the Army to switch to a new TOE, battalion by battalion. The information generated by PEM for the current year will guide the distribution of equipment; that for future years will assist logistics planning. For example, PEM will inform the commander of  an installation containing one or more tank battalions when  Mls will  replace M60s.  Thus,  he  will  know  the  dates  by  which  he  will  have  to enlarge the garage doors on post. PEM embodies the Department of  the Army Master Priority List (DAMPL), the document which establishes the sequence in  which battalions receive new equip› ment.  DAM PL  is  based  on  NATO  war  requirements. ODCSLOG, ODCSOPS, and  DARCOM began exploring ways to  override the  DAMPL  to satisfy  other needs as  well,  for ex› ample,  new equipment for  training in  CONUS and  the  Rapid Deployment Force. ODCSLOG and DESCOM also began work on a  module that would project the distribution and disposition of displaced systems, such as the M60.

The Logistics Data Network (LOGNET) is  being developed to help in crisis situations.  Entering a  roster of troop units pre› paring to deploy  into the  LOGNET data base would trigger a series of  automatic computations to indicate Class VII item short› ages at unit and force  levels,  redistribute  Class  VII  assets from designated sources to fill the shortage, and determine the amount of  selected Class V (ammunition) and Class IX (repair parts) items available  to sustain the force.  The system would also determine the requirements for petroleum products in the force list.  LOG› NET would not be able to report the amount and types of fuel actually on hand within the  units.  On 7  April  1981, ODCSOPS published the functional  description of LOGNET.  The agency also signed a memorandum of  agreement for development of  the LOGNET prototype with the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), the organization responsible for constructing the system. DCA chaired a review of systems requirements held on 21  May, which approved a modified version of  the ODCSLOG functional description and published it on 26 June. DCA awarded a design contract to TRW. In August, DCA selected the system hardware in  conjunction with  ODCSLOG,  and  the  following  month  the two agencies and the contractor reviewed system specifications.

The Standard Army Ammunition System (SAAS) is a  multi› command  management  information  network  which  interfaces

with the Worldwide Ammunition Reporting System (WARS) and provides integrated reports of  Class V (ammunition) stock in the logistics pipeline from the ammunition supply points at field army level  through the Theater Army Materiel  Management Center (TAMMC). The U.S.  Army Logistics Center, operating in  con› junction  with  Computer Systems  Command,  developed  SAAS Level-1 for TAMMC and is working on SAAS-3 for COSCOM and SAAS-4 for the ammunition supply points.

In July 1981 the U.S. Army Audit Agency approved the Au› tomation  Economic  Analysis  (AEA)  detailing the cost of devel› opment  for  SAAS-4.  This  permitted  the  DCSLOG  staff  to prepare a  system decision paper.  (A  system  decision  paper is  a formal  document which details the status of an automated data system  in  the  development cycle,  the cost of continuing devel› opment, and the possible alternatives and their costs.  It provides the basis for a decision by the Army staff  on whether to continue to develop either hardware or software.) During August a  rep› resentative  from  ODCSLOG chaired a  field  validation  test  for SAAS-I System Change Package (SCP) 15 at the 200th TAMMC in  Zweibruecken,  Germany.  This change provides an  interface with  SAAS-3  and allows  the  compilation  of information  con› cerning the amount of ammunition on order, the time it is  due in,  and  the amount of ammunition  in  stages of transit  but not yet delivered.

The losses  that  the  Army  faces  in  combat will  require  the ability to replace temporarily any damaged equipment undergo› ing repair.  It consequently maintains a pool of  spares for such a contingency,  called  a  Combat  Operation  Readiness Float (CORF).  The  Concepts  Analysis  Agency  (CAA)  developed  a CORF simulation model to use with the Wartime Requirements for  Ammunition,  Materiel,  and  Personnel  (WARRAMP)  pro› gram.  CAA  required additional  information on battle  damage and direct support repair rates before reaching any definite con› clusions. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Agency (AMSAA) and DARCOM agreed to  work  with  CAA  to  get this  information. ODCSLOG anticipated completion of a working prototype by  1 January  1982 and of  full  development by  March  1982.

In  contrast to  LOGNET, SAAS,  and  the  CORF simulation model,  which  are still  in  development,  the  Standard Army  In› termediate  Level Supply Subsystem  (SAILS)  has  been  in  place for some years.  SAILS is  the supply system operating at instal› lation,  corps,  theater,  medical  activity,  and selected U.S.  Army

Reserve  (USAR) sites.  When first  conceived,  SAILS was  to  be part  of the  Standard  Army  Logistics  System  which  was  never developed.  The comprehensive approach adopted at the begin› ning  of the  development  cycle  ensured  that  SAILS  would  be compatible  with  all  other  automated  logistics  systems.  During 1981  the  U.S.  Army Logistics Center (LOGCEN) and the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command (USACSC) extended an ex› panded version of  the system, SAILS ABX, to fifty-four locations throughout the  world,  thereby completing over  70  percent of the entire program.

As noted in last year's report, in  1980 LOGCEN completed a  study  of automated  wartime functional  supply  requirements, which concluded that SAILS could not accommodate expected wartime  volumes  of information.  As  a  result  of this  study  the Army initiated the development of a new supply system capable of  handling wartime loads. In March 1981 the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Installations,  Logistics,  and  Financial  Manage› ment approved the mission element needs statement (MENS) for the new system, called the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS).  ODCSLOG expected approval  of a  project manager (PM) charter for SARSS early in fiscal  year 1982.

For important equipment, such as tanks and helicopters, the Army maintains a  property book containing the names of indi› viduals  who are personally accountable for each item of equip› ment.  In  divisions  or separate  brigades,  the  property  book  is automated and maintained at the materiel management center. During  1981  LOGCEN and the Computer Systems Command worked to replace the current system, the Division Logistics Sys› tem (DLOGS) Property Book, with the Standard Property Book System  (SPBS).  SPBS software has  had a  long period in devel› opment. Originally a  part of SAILS during that system's early development, SPBS was made a separate subsystem by 1971  be› cause of its  increasing  complexity.  In  1977  Computer Systems Command tested a  SPBS prototype at Fort Carson,  Colorado, but opposition  in  ODCSLOG soon  brought development  to a halt. By fiscal  year 1981  ODCSLOG had reversed itself. During the  year,  LOGCEN and  USACSC  reprogrammed SPBS  to in› corporate changes needed as a result of previous prototype test› ing  and  new  regulatory  and  system  interface  requirements. USACSC scheduled divisional field testing for June 1982. When complete, SPBS will not only replace the Division Logistics Sys› tem (DLOGS) Property Book at divisions and brigades but will

also operate at installations and corps headquarters. SPBS, which will  interface with SAILS, SARSS, and the Direct Support Unit Standard Supply System (DS4), will  provide an  Armywide data base that will allow an individual item of  equipment to be tracked throughout the logistics system.

DS4 is a computer program designed to assist direct support units in distributing supplies. Developed and maintained at a cen› tral  location,  DS4 is  operable at multiple field sites  on  the De› centralized  Automated  Service  Support  System  (DAS3),  a decentralized computer hardware configuration. The DAS3 field systems  will  consist  of automated  data  processing  equipment housed in a  mobile van and powered by  standard military gen› erators or commercial  power.  Capable  of taking  the  field  and dedicated almost exclusively to logistics operations, DAS3 stands in  direct contrast to  the  philosophy  which created  the current generation of Army computers; they are immobile and concen› trated in centers designed to process all information requests› logistic, administrative,  and  tactical. As of  September  1981 ODCSLOG planned  to employ  DAS3  at first  in  nondivisional direct support or general support units  (DSU-GSU),  where  it would replace the aged National Cash Register (NCR) 500. After replacing the NCR 500s, the Army will introduce the DAS3 into nondivisional direct support and general support units not cur› rently automated-and into  Army divisions,  brigades, and corps support commands (COSCOMs) as replacements for existing In› ternational Business  Machine (IBM)  360 series computers.

Fielding  of production  model  DAS3s  began  in  December 1980. By 30 September 1981  the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command (USACSC)  had  distributed  fifty-four  DAS3s  to  the major commands. UntiJ Computer Systems Command completes work on DS4 (expected in the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 1982) the new computers will  use  Phoenix  interim software.  Phoenix refers to NCR 500 programs that are machine-translated to run on the DAS3. They take their name from the city in which the work was done.

DS4,  SPBS, SARSS,  SAILS, SAAS,  and LOGNET provide aggregations of data at division  and separate brigade levels.  A new system,  the Automated Retail Outlet System (AUTOROS), is  being designed to support installation Self-Service Supply Cen› ters (SSSC), Automated Central Issue Facilities (ACIF), and tables of distribution and allowance (TDA) shop supply.  AUTOROS, in addition to automating routine supply functions, will  provide

data  for  financial  accounting.  On  7  March  1980  the  Assistant Secretary of the Army (ASA) for Installations, Logistics, and Fi› nancial (IL&amp;FM) authorized the continued development of AU› TOROS  through  prototype  evaluation  testing.  TRADOC completed prototype testing of the SSSC module of  AUTO  ROS in October 1980. ODCSLOG and TRADOC will ask the assistant secretary to approve a  limited extension of the module in  fiscal year 1982.

The Automated Central Issue Facility System (ACIFS) is de› signed to automate the Central Issue Facility (CIF) on Army in› stallations. ACIFS provides total accountability for the temporary loan,  receipt,  issue,  turn-in,  inspection, exchange,  and stocking of organizational  clothing  and  individual  equipment.  The ASA(IL&amp;FM),  on  6  June  1980,  authorized  the  installation  of ACIFS at nine U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) sites, each supporting either a  division  or a  higher unit.  FORSCOM extended the system to Fort Benning during fiscal year 1981 and planned further extensions in  1982.

Work on Logistics Automated Marking and Reading Symbols (LOGMARS) began in 1976 with OSD as the proponent and with the Army as  the executive agent through  the DARCOM  Pack› aging,  Storage, and Containerization Center. LOGMARS has a bar-code source data acquisition technology similar to that used in  supermarkets and department stores.  It consists  of bar-code labels and the equipment required to produce and read them. A portable wand scanning unit reads the code on a label and passes the information to a  small hand-held computer for recording. If needed, an acousticoupler can also relay the information via tele› phone lines to a host computer at the installation, where the data is reconciled and then printed as part of  the installation inventory. The system  can  inventory  more  items  in  an  hour  than  can  be done manually in a  day.  Tests at Fort Monmouth,  New Jersey, indicated that LOGMARS could cut inventory time by as much as 68 percent. On 29 September the Director for Supply Man› agement Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics,  chaired a senior ad› visory group (SAG) meeting on LOGMARS. It formally adopted symbol display characteristics throughout the Department of  De› fense, lifted a  moratorium on testing by the individual services, and approved the implementation of  LOG  MARS by the services. SAG established  the third quarter  of fiscal  1982  as  the  target date for completion of specifications for the labels as  well as in-

structions on how to  prepare them.  The Army planned to  im› plement  LOGMARS  during fiscal  year  1982  at  wholesale, installation, and combat service support levels.

Army logisticians need to know not only the location of par› ticular supplies and equipment  but also  the  location  of entire shipments  of mixed  cargo  and  the  transportation  required  to move those materials  from  point to point.  The U.S.  Army Lo› gistics Center during 1981  continued to develop computer pro› grams and improve existing ones to fill  these  needs.  The Department of the  Army  Movements  Management System (DAMMS)  is  an  automated data processing system designed  to assist a  theater transportation manager in monitoring the move› ment of cargo into,  within,  and out of the theater and to plan for  movement  of cargo  in  the  theater  during  wartime.  The DAMMS cargo movements module (CMM) provides the moni› toring capability.  Phase I,  which  covers  the entry of cargo into the theater, was  operational during 1981.  LOGCEN completed the  functional  development and  design  of the  DAMMS  cargo movements module in  March  1981  when the ASA(IL&amp;FM) ap› proved the system  change request (SCR) and economic analysis (EA) of Phases II and Ill, the intratheater and export functions. In the same  month LOGCEN  completed the functional  devel› opment and design work which laid out how the various modules and the phases of the entire DAMMS would interact. LOGCEN submitted an analysis of the various hardware changes needed to support DAMMS to the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics. These changes included amendments to DAS3 and the Division Level Data Entry Device (DLDED). ODCSLOG decided to fund the changes from the fiscal year 1983 budget. ODCSLOG plans to extend DAMMS to the Eighth Army in Korea and con› tinues to study the problem of  communications support require› ments for DAMMS in Korea.

The Movement Planning Module (MPM) automates wartime movements in a theater of operations. It derived from a portion of the  models  in  the  U.S.  Army  Worldwide  Logistics  System (MAWLOGS)  that dealt  with  movements  planning.  LOGCEN began technical conversion of the selected models in May  1981. The module when complete would permit simulation of various tactical situations, such as the damage or destruction of bridges, pipelines, railroads, or nontactical vehicles, and the identification of the best response to these conditions. At the end of the year

LOGCEN was  developing  the final  functional  description  and economic analysis for the module.

Mechanization  of  Selected  Transportation  Movements (MECHTRAM) is  an automated system  that provides  logistics and financial  information on the movement of Army-sponsored cargo and passengers within the Defense Transportation System network. MECHTRAM also has the ability to forecast and budget for short- and  long-range airlift and  sealift  requirements.  The computer facility at the U.S. Army Management Systems Support Agency  (USAMSSA)  has  provided  automated  data  processing support  for  MECHTRAM  since  the  system's transfer  to  that agency  in  1978.  The transfer did  not include  the  descriptions and  narration  that accompanied the seventy-five  programs en› compassing the system.  As  a  result the  facility  has  experienced difficulties  in  maintaining  MECHTRAM.  To  resolve  the  com› puter maintenance  problems,  USAMSSA  developed  a  plan  to evaluate and redesign the system. It expected to complete work on the redesign in  the fourth  quarter of  fiscal  year 1982.

The  Department  of the  Army  Standard  Port  System-En› hanced (DASPS-E) is a collection of interrelated computer pro› grams designed to assist the operations of  all  major CO  NUS and overseas ports. During 1981  development work continued with› out any major setbacks. Technical development began in Novem› ber 1980 when Alan]. Gibbs, the ASA(IL&amp;FM), granted a waiver to the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command to begin technical design,  programming,  and  testing.  Approval  of functional  de› velopment was completed in  August 1981  when Joel E.  Bonner, Jr., Assistant Secretary Gibbs'  successor, approved the final func› tional description (FD), economic analysis (EA), and detailed re› quirements document (DRD).  Work on hardware requirements for the system also proceeded during fiscal year 1981. In Decem› ber 1980 Computer Systems Command submitted a requirements operational  capability (ROC) document for DASPS-E.  It listed the functional  requirements  that the Decentralized Automated Service Support System needed to process DASPS-E data. These consisted of  a series of  performance standards for particular items of hardware,  such as tape  drives  capable  of reaching a  certain speed,  printers  with  a  particular  capacity,  and  communication interfaces  over  certain  distances.  In  September  1981  General Thompson  nominated  a  project  manager  for  DASPS-E,  and ODCSLOG prepared the project manager charter for submission to Assistant Secretary Bonner.

More than thirty years ago private industry used computers to reduce the number of people required to do routine admin› istrative  tasks.  The  Department of Defense  first  applied  auto› mated data processing systems to operational tasks and only now is using them in routine administration. The Transportation Op› erational Personal Property System (TOPS) is one such computer program. It supports routine administrative functions similar in all shipping offices regardless of service.  During 1981  the Assis› tant Secretary of Defense  for  Manpower,  Reserve Affairs,  and Logistics  directed  the  Navy  to  develop and  test  TOPS and  to provide the other services  with system  specifications which sat› isfied  the  functional  requirements  of their systems.  The Navy experienced difficulties which have, in effect, delayed the Army's development and implementation plans. Because TOPS promises to provide substantial manpower and financial economies within four years,  the  Department of Defense  funded  it through  the Productivity  Enhancing  Capital  Investment  program,  a  proce› dure established  to  support programs  which promised  a  quick return on investments.

The Corps of Engineers  has  taken  the  lead  in  developing computer applications for the planning, design, and construction of buildings. Each  year the Corps' Military Construction, Army (MCA), program deals with an average of fifty  types of facilities in some stage of development. This volume of work,  the repe› tition of  these types of  facilities year after year, and the pressure to keep costs low while at the same time meeting rising standards of  safety, accessibility, and efficiency have encouraged the Corps to explore the possibility of  using automated data processing sys› tems. During the 1970s, computer technology evolved rapidly in the area of computer-aided design (CAD).  Engineers first used computers to  make  calculations,  then  to  handle  basic  data  for accounting,  specification  production,  and drafting.  By  the  end of the decade these simple functions were being linked to allow construction  of a  geometric description  of a  design.  Computer graphics and geometry could do everything  that a  balsa  wood model could do and more, such as allowing an engineer to detect early  in  his  design  any  interference  between  the  layout of the heating and cooling systems in a  building.

The Computer-Aided Engineering and Architectural Design System (CAEADS) is being developed at the Corps' Construction Engineering  Research  Laboratory  (CERL),  located  in  Cham-

paign, Illinois. The purpose of  the project is to modify automated data  processing systems developed  independently over  the past few  years so that they interface and to develop additional pro› grams  when  needed  in  order to  provide  computer support to engineers  throughout  the  MCA  design  cycle,  from  predesign through final  design, as shown  below.

During 1981  CAEADS began to become available as an inte› grated system. Eight modules, some of  which dated from before the beginning of the CAEADS system,  were  complete.  Seven  of the modules pertained to the early stages of  design, primarily functional layout and analysis. They were combined and tested at the concept level of  the design phase on more than one hundred MCA projects from the fiscal  year 1984 budget. CERL called this combined sys› tem,  only  a  small  portion  of the  complete  CAEADS,  Concept CAEADS. Below is a drawing that represents the major integrated subsystems of  Concept CAEADS.

<!-- image -->

The DD Form 1391  Processor is a CAEADS subsystem devel› oped by CERL that is used in both the predesign and concept design phases of  the MCA design cycle. It  consists of  a data base containing all the information found on DD Form 1391, including the status of the project and any comments from the review levels.  In predesign the processor helps the facilities engineer prepare MCA project sub› mittals by producing budget estimates and ensuring that the infor› mation submitted is complete and consistent. In the concept design phase it provides raw data for the Design Information System (DIS), a  subsystem  developed  in  the  Office  of the  Chief of Engineers (OCE). DIS reviews the MCA project design that the Corps can use without modification or with only a few changes to satisfy the needs of  a new project.

SKETCH, a  computer-aided  facility  layout  system  also  devel› oped by CERL, lets the designer lay out and enter two-dimensional graphic building information in CAEADS, He  can retrieve standard designs for modification or begin original ones using a graphics ter› minal. SKETCH is the crux of Concept CAEADS. Building infor› mation  entered  via  SKETCH can  later  be  retrieved  for  design evaluation. By the end of  fiscal  year 1981  CERL had developed in› terfaces between SKETCH and the other subsystems of Concept CAEADS. It had also begun work to link SKETCH to a  three-di› mensional data base that will  be used in a final design phase.

The Systematic Evaluation of  Architectural Criteria (SEARCH) is  yet another subsystem that originated in CERL. It consists of  a

collection of  evaluation modules which ensure that a facility design is  in  compliance with  criteria in design guides,  technicaJ  manuals, building codes, and other documents. In its current stage of devel› opment SEARCH reviews floor-plan layouts provided by SKETCH for compliance  with five  sets of criteria:  maximum and minimum areas, acoustic separation, waJking distances, visual control, and ac› cessibility  to  the  handicapped.  CERL  was  working  on nine  addi› tional  modules when the fiscaJ  year ended: fire safety,  equipment inventories, occupant load requirements, noise control, energy con› servation, solar feasibility,  spatiaJ  efficiency, and service subsystem tenninal elements. SEARCH gives a  designer the ability to check alternatives to the original proposal frequently and easily. He simply modifies the floor plan in SKETCH, then SEARCH automatically compares the new design to the evaluation modules. The designer may repeat this process as many times as necessary to obtain the best design. SEARCH lets the user identify and resolve design conflicts during the critical early stages of  the work. Furthermore, it makes consistent evaluation of  alternatives possible, greatly increasing the probability that a designer will produce the optimal design.

Building Loads AnaJysis and System Thermodynamics (BLAST) is a comprehensive set of  programs prepared by CERL for predict› ing energy consumption and energy system performance and cost in new and redesigned buildings. It helps designers perform peak› load  calculations,  that  is,  the  maximum  BTU  input  required  to bring a facility  up to the design temperature on the coldest winter day, or the maximum amount of  BTUs needed to be removed from the facility  to reach  the design temperature on the hottest day in summer. Peak-load calculations are needed to design the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and to select the most appropriate equipment for a  building.  Because BLAST pro› vides estimates of  a facility's  annual energy performance, a designer can  use  it  to evaJuate alternatives.  In Concept CAEADS,  BLAST automatically  selects  building  information  from  SKETCH  and makes calculations using meteorological data from the building site. The mechanical designer needs only to enter a concept HV  AC de› scription  at a  terminal.  The description  would  include  a  thermal zone layout, materiaJs to be used in walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs, and fan and plant locations. BLAST provides results in a short time, which means that repeated use is inexpensive.  A designer can thus examine aJternative designs to ensure that the finaJ  design of  both the facility and the plant conserves energy.

The Automated Budget Estimating System (ABES), developed by  the  Middle  East  Division  (Rear),  extracts twelve  criteria from SKETCH, such as  gross floor area,  building type,  energy supply,

and number of  floors, and generates a complete and detailed list of construction  tasks  and quantities  of materials  required  to price a building. This information is  then fed  to the Cost E.5timating Sys› tem, also a product of the Middle East Division, which generates a direct cost estimate.

CERL estimated that the test of Concept CAEADS in support of the fiscal  year 1984 building program, which was completed in February 1981, saved approximately $3 million, 20 to 25 percent of the total design costs. Budget submission reports from  the test in› cluded function, energy, and cost analyses of  alternative designs for 113  projects.  The architectural  and  engineering firm  of Hayes, Seay,  Mattern, and Mattern of Roanoke,  Virginia, prepared final reports  and  combined  them  with  scaled  drawings.  The firm  re› ceived technical assistance from CERL and from the University of Michigan and used computer terminals in the Engineering Division, Military Programs Directorate (MPE), Office of the Chief of  Engi› neers. MPE reviewed and accepted the reports before giving them to the field offices to guide future design projects.

Work on predesign CAEADS is the least advanced of the three phases of CAEADS. The 1391  Processor is  ready and integrated into Concept CAEADS. The Environmental Technical Information System  (ETIS),  developed  by  CERL,  is  available  as  a  stand-alone system but is not yet integrated into predesign CAEADS. ETIS will determine the environmental impacts of new construction and its operation and maintenance. Still to be designed are the Project De› velopment Brochure (PDB) Processor, the Computer Evaluation of Utility Plans (CEUP) System, the Installation Graphics Analysis Sys› tem,  the Pollution  Abatement Management System (PAMS), and the Installation Facility Mobilization Planning System.

CERL planned in  1981  to concentrate its efforts over the next few years on the final design cycle of  CAEADS. By the end of  Sep› tember 1981 it had developed an interface between SKETCH and a  three-dimensional modeling system calJed ARCH: MODEL, which  is  still  undergoing development.  When  complete,  ARCH: MODEL will provide data structures and data retrieval of  geometric and  physical  properties  of the  construction  materials.  A  central three-dimensional data base will permit easy retrieval of  plans, ele› vations, details, and sections.

The final design cycle ofCAEDS will also include the Computer› Aided Cost E.5timating System (CACES)-to permit detailed cost estimates of  a project in the advanced stages of  design-and EDIT› SPEC. This latter system simplifies preparation of  project construc› tion specifications based on Corps of  Engineers guidelines. A writer marks a  computer-generated  list of a  project's design  conditions.

EDITSPEC automaticaJly pulls all pertinent guidance and places it in the correct location in the project  specification. EDITSPEC prints aJl specifications-formatted,  paragraphed,  correctly  paginated, and ready to go directly into the construction contract. The Office of the Chief of Engineers assigned the Huntsville Division to test, maintain, and operate EDITSPEC. The division started the formal prototype test in May  1980 and completed it in December 1980. During the test, the division made cost comparisons between man› ual and EDITSPEC specification preparation methods. The test in› dicated that EDITSPEC would save about 35 percent of the cost of preparing specifications. The Corps anticipated a decision early in the first  quarter of fiscal  year  1982  on  extending EDITSPEC to nineteen Corps of  Engineers offices. CERL planned to test the final design in the fall of 1982.

The present system of  preparing  an installation master plan con› sists of  making a negative engraving of  a map and plan data, a pro› cess called scribing; leroying,  or inking, descriptive data; and reproducing, including screening, the finished product. The inabil› ity to update maps and plans easily on a daily basis creates problems with regard to storage, retrieval, and assimilation of pertinent data before it is placed on maps and plans. Installation master plans pre› pared in this manner exhibit high quality, but the labor effort is so intense that current master plans are seldom available.

During 1981  various Corps offices worked on computer-aided graphics  in  installation  master planning,  which have  begun to re› place the current system. Ultimately CERL will integrate them into CAEADS. The Fort Worth District helped Fort Hood acquire an automated mapping system based on new aerial photogrammetric mapping of the installation, validation of  master plan items, includ› ing utility systems, and access to a data bank provided by the con› tractor. The Savannah District completed an implementation study for an interactive graphics and analysis system and terrain analysis system, which is a primer on the subject of  automated graphics. The district  also contracted for a study to establish graphic standards for automated master planning and prepared a new technical bulletin to  standardize  master-plan  presentation.  Huntsville  Division  con› tracted to provide automated basic information maps, the new term for master plans, for two DARCOM installations. The Office of  the Chief of  Engineers funded the preparation of mobilization master plans for two military installations through the division.

The Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) is an in› stallation computer system which controls the operation of  building mechanical and electrical systems to conserve the most energy and to reduce operating costs.  During fiscal  year 1981, OCE published

guide specifications for the four different EMCS sizes. As the state of  the art advances-and it is dramatically-the overlap in capacity grows. The Corps prepared the final text of  a technical manual on EMCS design, which it planned to publish during fiscal  year 1982.

Suppliers and installers of  EMCS experienced significant delays during 1981  in putting the new system in place. Problems in com› puter program development and shortages of electronic compo› nents were the most important factors.  Experience gained during the year confirmed the wisdom  of using a  distributed  processing configuration for large- and medium-sized systems,  that is,  to put the large- or medium-sized computer in a central facility and to put a micro- or small-sized computer in each building. The computers could talk back and forth. If  a small computer was down, the large computer could operate the climate controls for the building and vice versa. Redundancy increased reliability.

The  Chief Counsel's Office  of OCE  developed  and  imple› mented contractual methods to secure optional software licensing agreements to ease maintenance contracting and system expansion acquisitions.  Software is a  copyrighted product.  Vendors who de› velop software and those who service it have to reach an agreement about  royalty  payments  before  a  system  goes  on  line.  The new agreements promise dramatic savings in time.

The Defense Energy Information System (DEIS) is a computer› based Department of  Defense report for compiling all energy con› sumption statistics. During  fiscal year 1981 the DOD Energy Office was coordinating the final stages of  a massive revision of  DEIS. The Army Energy Office in  ODCSLOG handled the Army portion of the revision, which will enable reporting installations to submit per› tinent data on consumption, including changes in population, weather conditions, and  real  estate inventories.  The information will allow the Department of Defense to evaluate each installation's energy efficiency for the first time.

The Medical Facilities Design Office (MFDO) of the Corps of Engineers used three automated systems as aids in the management of  medical facilities design during fiscal year 1981: the Building De› sign  System and General Design System (BDS-GDS), the Design Office Computer-Format for Review  (DOC-FR) System, and the SKETCH and SEARCH subsystems of CAEADS. The Corps in› stalled a DOC-FR interactive computer system in the Medical Fa› cilities Design Office  during April 1981. By the end  of  the fiscal year MFDO was using the system on the U.S. Army Hospital project at Fort Carson, Colorado. The system allows design review comments to be entered, stored, updated, and reported; organizes the com› ments for use during the review conferences; aids in the review of

the next project submitted; and furnishes reviewers with a system report  organized  by  discipline,  with  all  the  previous  conference notes and action items added.

BDS-GDS  is  a  large  integrated  architectural  design  system which provides automated procedures for pulling together prelimi› nary  concept  information  covering  development  of  alternative schemes for building layout and associated studies and provides de› sign  merit  analysis  dealing  with measurements,  materials,  costs, heating, and lighting. Design development is relatively quick, allow› ing the designer to address a fuJI  range of  options of  siting, circula› tion  flow,  layout,  energy  efficiency,  and cost.  In  many  ways  the system  overlaps  functions  performed  by  Concept  CAEADS,  but BDS-GDS lacks  many  of the  capabilities  of Concept  CAEADS. BDS-GDS, for example, cannot aid in the design of  nonrectangular structures. It cannot prepare an energy budget for a facility because it cannot project energy use throughout the year. However, the sys› tem has the advantage of  being available for immediate use. MFDO first used the system on the Troop Medical Clinic project for Camp Casey,  Korea.  Although work did not begin  until  February 1981, use ofBDS-GDS saved approximately one year of  design time. The Corps submitted the concept design through the Secretary of the Army to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Installations and Housing.

MFDO used SKETCH and SEARCH to evaluate new medical projects and plans for renovation of  existing facilities, for example, the Bremerhaven Hospital project. MFDO selected the final design on  the  basis  of the  analysis  performed  by  the  two  subsystems  of CAEADS.

## Materiel Maintenance

Repair and modification of  equipment are among the most im› portant services  provided  to  tactical  units  by  logisticians.  During 1981 the Army prepared to modify the M60A2 tank and pursued various programs to enhance the performa11ce of  equipment  already in  the field.  These programs included the Army Oil Analysis Pro› gram, a new policy on printed circuit board maintenance, and an assessment of  test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment calibra› tion.  Aviation  maintenance,  reflecting  the increasing  prominence given  to Army aviation since  1973, also received  much attention. Work continued on conversion to the three-level aviation  rnainte~ nance concept. Revision of  two key Army regulations, scheduled for publication  in  1982,  promised greater precision  in  reporting the condition of aviation equipment. Other areas of concentration in-

eluded aviation  materiel  and aviation depot roundout.  Finally,  in recognition of the importance of maintenance, the Army planned to initiate an annual competition for a unit maintenance award.

In May 1980 General Vessey, the Vice Chief  of  Staff, approved a  recommendation  from  ODCSOPS  to  withdraw  M60A2  tanks from  the active  Army and convert them with an  M48A2  turret. ODCSOPS proposed to call the hybrid the M48A7. The M60A2 had been armed with a  low-velocity  152-mm.  cannon and missile launcher assembly which fired  the Shillelagh missile as  its primary round and a conventional shell as its alternative. The M48A5 turret mounted a  high-velocity  105-mm. gun.  By  the end of 1981  both CONUS and USAREUR maneuver units had turned in all of  their M60A2s-540 vehicles, the entire Army inventory-to the Annis› ton Army Depot in  Alabama for refitting.  In May  1981,  because increased funds were available to the Army, ODCSOPS reevaluated the decision  to convert the M60A2 to the M48A  7.  Instead, ODCSOPS proposed that the Anniston Depot convert them to an M60A3  model.  This  proposal  proved  impractical  because  the M60A3 production line would not be in operation during 1983 and 1984. At the end of the fiscal  year ODCSOPS was preparing a de› cision  paper for the Vice Chief of  Staff which  recommended con› verting the A2s  to Armored Vehicle  Launched Bridges (AVLBs) and Combat Engineer  Vehicles  (CEVs).  ODCSOPS  expected  an evaluation of the action by DARCOM by January 1982 and a final decision sometime later.

The Army Oil Analysis Program (AOAP) is a key component of the Army's shift from a philosophy of maintenance on schedule to one of maintenance based on condition: "If it ain't  broke, don't  fix it." AOAP involves the collection of  sample crank-case oil from en› gines and use of  a pectrometer to identify trace metals. Concentra› tions above a  certain  level  indicate  the need for specific  kinds of maintenance,  depending on  which  metal  has  reached the  critical density.  The use of this diagnostic tool promises to reduce mainte› nance costs while enhancing safety.  Originally developed to better service aircraft engines, the program spread to include other Army vehicles and continued to expand during fiscal year 1981.

The  anticipated addition of  two new laboratories during the  first quarter of 1982 would bring the Armywide total to fifteen.  In ad› dition, the Material  Readiness Support Activity (MRSA) of DAR› COM initiated  actions  to  establish  a  laboratory  at  the  National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, and provided on-site as› sistance to Egypt to determine what was needed to establish an oil analysis laboratory there. The quantity of  oil samples analyzed and

the kinds of  services provided by the laboratories also increased in 1981.

ODCSLOG, operating in  conjunction with  ODCSOPS, DAR› COM, and the Computer Systems Command, continued to work on integrating automatic data processing equipment into the AOAP process. DARCOM proposed the adoption of the Navy stand-alone minicomputer system for the Army's oil analysis requirements.  At the end of the year DARCOM was  preparing a  mission  element needs statement for review by the Army staff.

General Meyer assigned to DCSLOG the responsibility for con› ducting an Armywide assessment of all  test, measurement, and di› agnostic equipment (TMDE) functions to find where improvements are needed and to develop plans for corrective action. The DCSLOG established a  Department of the Army TMDE Action Team consisting of  eight action officers to direct  and coordinate the review. The team will begin work early in fiscal year 1982.

The rapid proliferation of  solid state circuitry during the 1970s made  maintenance  policy  for  support of Printed  Circuit Boards (PCB) obsolete. As the Army moved into a comprehensive modern› ization  program,  ODCSLOG worked to create a  more definitive PCB maintenance policy. The office reviewed existing guidance as well as current and projected requirements and devised a new main› tenance policy, which it sent to the field for review and comment. The office also requested that the field submit alternative policies if they appeared better adapted to local needs and conditions.

Much of the innovation in  materiel maintenance during 1981 centered on  Army aviation.  The conversion of all  divisional  and nondivisional aircraft maintenance to the three-level-maintenance concept-that is, aviation  unit maintenance, aviation intermediate maintenance,  and depot maintenance-was completed.  The new units which resulted still suffered some equipment shortages at the end in the year.

ODCSLOG devoted considerable effort to revising two Army regulations dealing  with  aviation:  AR  95-18, "Aviation Safety  of Flight Program," and AR 95-33, "Army Aircraft Inventory, Status, and Flying Time Reporting," both scheduled for completion early in  fiscal  year  1982.  The  Aviation  Logistics  Office  in  ODCSLOG collected and analyzed data for over one year following the imple› mentation of 1979 in a major revision of  the previous edition of AR 95-33. The new update of AR 95-33 will refine the  1979 regula› tion, place greater emphasis on achieving full mission-capable goals for each aircraft system, and highlight problems which most often prevent units from achieving these goals. (An aircraft is fully mission capable when it can perform all of  its primary mission and meets the

equipment requirements for flight under visual meteorological con› ditions, both day and night, and for nights under instrument mete› orological  conditions.) The revision  of AR 95-18  will  add a  new category to safety of  flight (SOF) messages-those communications which  warn  or advise about unsafe flight procedures and materiel or maintenance deficiencies.  In the 1973 edition of  the regulation, these communications consisted of  operational, technical, one-time inspection, and advisory messages. The draft revision added to clas› sification maintenance mandatory to the list.  It would require repair work and submission  of a report when  the task was  complete but wou Id not ground aircraft or limit their mission-capable status.

The Aviation Intensive Management Items (AIMI) program, es› tablished by the U.S.  Army Troop Support and Aviation Materiel Readiness  Command (TSARCOM)  under authority contained in AR 710-1, applies to items  in  the Aircraft Component Intensive Management System (ACIMS); major aircraft components, such as engines, transmissions, rotors, and  airframes; and items in short sup› ply, such as bearings, helicopter skid shoes, and fuel pumps. Special management techniques applied  to AIMI items include expedited shipment and return  to depot, manual processing of requisitions, redistribution when feasible, and periodic negotiation of  supporta› ble levels within the major commands. The last element constitutes the most unique feature of the program. TSARCOM holds AIMI conferences semiannually with  representatives of the  major com› mands in attendance. The primary business  of the meetings is to negotiate supportable levels  with the customer commands and to ensure an  equitable distribution of  available assets.  The conferees review the requirements of  the major commands, examine available assets at both the national and user level, look at the quantities of unserviceable items returned by the customer, and establish supply levels.

Work on the problem posed by the disposal of  finite-life aviation materiel, highlighted in the 1980 controversy over the mutilation of helicopter rotor blades which had exceeded their normal operating life,  continued  in  fiscal year  1981.  TSARCOM  requested  that DCSLOG assist in obtaining a DOD decision on disposal policy. As a consequence, the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense (Energy, En› vironment, and Safety) prepared a memorandum that required the Army to develop a  system  to ensure  that any  unsafe  rotor blade turned over to a  property disposal  office  would not be resold  or reissued.  At the end of the fiscal  year ODCSLOG was developing the necessary safeguards and was continuing to review  policy and procedures for disposing of other finite-life aviation items, such as gears and bearing assemblies. TSARCOM continued to mutilate un-

safe  finite-life  items before sending them  to  property disposal  of› fices.

In 1976 the Department of  the Army initiated an action in con› junction with DARCOM and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) to examine utilization of  four of the National Guard's transportation aircraft repair shops (TARS). These shops have highly qualified air› craft maintenance personnel. In September 1979 the Department of the Army converted these shops to Aviation  Classification  and Repair Activity Depots (AVCRAD). DARCOM became responsible for peacetime training in preparation for mobilization. During mo› bilization the Army will assign the National Guard's AVCRADs to DARCOM. One AVCRAD will deploy early to Europe using POM› CUS equipment. The three remaining AVCRADs will assist deploy› ing  FORSCOM  units,  prepare follow-on  aircraft  to  meet deployment criteria, and supplement the DARCOM depot mainte› nance workload. The deploying AVCRAD will straddle the aviation logistics pipeline, acting as a terminus for aircraft, engines, and com› ponents deploying and returning to CONUS depots and providing back-up support for  USAREUR aviation maintenance  units.  The concept is known as aviation depot roundout.

Responding to a growing need for formal recognition of  excep› tional maintenance efforts at the organizational level, ODCSLOG developed a unit maintenance award during 1981, which the Army will offer for the first time in  1982. As part of  the ongoing Mainte› nance Improvement Program (MIP), the award will provide an in› centive for  improving unit readiness.  The Philip A.  Connelly and National Defense Transportation Association (NDTA) awards served as models.

## Supply Management and Depot Operations

The Army Stock  Fund  is  a  big  revolving  credit deposit  that ODCSLOG maintains to purchase repair parts, such as ball bear› ings, nuts, and bolts, that are held at  Army depots until they are sold to units in the field.  During fiscal  year 1981  the Army Stock Fund provided some 255,000 different items for the Army.  Obligations to replenish depot stocks during the year amounted to $5.8 billion, while the depots shipped $5.4 billion worth of  repair parts to units. The Army Stock Fund will cover fewer items in fiscal  year  1982. The Deputy Secretary of Defense,  after receiving  updated com› ments from the services, directed on 7 July 1981  that as a test they transfer 200,000 consumable items to the Defense Logistics Agency for management. The Army share is 36,000 items. At the same time he chartered a joint  steering committee and a joint implementation

group to develop a  plan  to carry out this decision.  The plan  was virtually complete by the end of  the fiscal year.

The Procurement Account Secondary Item Program purchases spare components, such as engines, transmissions, and helicopter ro› tor assemblies. These are "free issued"  to the units. Funding levels for the program during fiscal year 1981 amounted to $856.5 million compared with $478.3 million during 1980. The increase of$378.2 million resulted from the need to support new weapons systems that the Army fielded as part of its modernization program, from infla› tion, and from  increases in  production lead-times. The fiscal  year 1981  supplemental  budget  made a  considerable  contribution  to› ward the purchase of  spares and spare parts in  the Army's  war re› serves. The budget allocated $34 million to the Army Stock Fund (ASF)  War Reserves for  use by the Army contingent of the Rapid Deployment Force. The Procurement Appropriation, Army (PAA), line of  the Defense budget received an additional $27.7 million, of which $24.7 million went to weapons and combat tracked vehicles and $3 million went to aircraft.

Central supply and depot maintenance activities, funded out of Program 7 of the Operation and Maintenance, Army (OMA), line of  the Department of  Defense budget, cost approximately $3.9 bil› lion in  fiscal  year  1981. These programs provided for the receipt, storage, issue, and transportation of  supplies and equipment world› wide;  for  the  maintenance of an  industrial  base;  and for  the  per› formance of  necessary maintenance of  supplies and equipment held in inventory  to  ensure  their  readiness  for  issue  to  units  when needed. During 1981 rampant cost increases caused budget supple› ments and amendments and prevented the program from being ex› ecuted  as  planned.  The Army's actual  obligations for  fiscal  year 1981 in Program 7 and planned obligations for fiscal years 1982 and 1983, in millions of  dollars, are noted below:

|                                                                   | FY 81   | FY82    | FY83    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Central Supply (includes BASOPSand RPMA)                          | 2,793.9 | 3,043.5 | 3,291.9 |
| Depot Maimenance. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 1,376.9 | 1,540.2 | 1,770.4 |

The Army Industrial Fund (AIF) is a working capital fund sus› tained on an annual basis by reimbursements from customer units and organizations for goods and services furnished by arsenals, de› pots, laboratories, missile facilities, and CO  NUS port terminals. The port terminals  charge their customers  for  the shipment of major items of equipment to other installations where they receive high› level maintenance, a term that  describes major repairs such as rebor-

ing an artillery tube and overhauling major motors and tanks. Dur› ing  fiscal year  1981,  the  AIF  received  reimbursements  of $2.6 billion.  Of this amount DARCOM obtained $2.4 billion, which it used to finance such functions as depot maintenance and  supply and research and development. The remaining $0.2 billion went to the Military Traffic Management Command for CONUS ocean termi› nal services. During fiscal year 1981  the AIF received "pass through" funding in the amount of  $77.94 million from OSD. This funding reimbursed the principal of the AIF for inflationary costs not included in the stabilized billing rates and provided an improved cash position for future operations. While the cost of  operations for the AIF will rise in  1982, the growth reflects salary increases and other inflationary factors rather than significant program increases. ODCSLOG placed special emphasis during 1981 on reducing over› head costs in  AIF operations to obtain the lowest possible costs for customers.

Base Operations (-) is that portion of  the budget devoted to the unglamorous day-to-day  operation  of Army installations, such as food service and minor equipment maintenance. The minus in pa› rentheses indicates  that it does not include real property mainte› nance (RPMA), which was formerly a part of the Base Operations line but is now a responsibility of the Corps of Engineers. Base Op› erations (-) did not experience any major funding inadequacies in 1981. Congressional support for the fiscal year 1981  program sup› plemental resulted in additional funds for food service equipment, furnishings  for  bachelor  housing, and civilian  personnel.  In addi› tion,  year-end  funds,  made available  by  the Director,  Operations and  Maintenance,  Army  (DOMA),  allowed  funding  of all  unfi› nanced requirements in the Base Operations (-) area capable of execution.  Compared  to  other years,  actual  spending conformed closely to planning. In 1981, direct obligations of Base Operations (-) amounted to $1.9 billion,  14.7  percent of the Operation and Maintenance Appropriation.

In 1978 the General Accounting Office recommended that the Department of Defense either designate or establish a single man› ager over aeronautical maintenance depots to stop waste.  An aero› nautical study group, chartered by the  Joint Logistics Commanders (JLC) to evaluate several management alternatives including a single manager, recommended a JLC action group as the  best solution. OSD established a Joint Aeronautical Depot Maintenance Action Group to recommend policies and actions  necessary  for efficient aeronautical depot support to the services. However, in March 1981 Frank C.  Carlucci, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, directed the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and

Logistics, Lawrence  J. Korb, to reexamine the single-manager issue. Of the several options given to the services by the Assistant Secre› tary,  the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the services preferred the status quo; the services would continue to operate their  aeronautical main› tenance depots and retain the primary role of  managing their logis› tic support functions. In September 1981 Deputy Secretary Carlucci approved this recommendation and established the DOD Aeronau› tical Depot Maintenance Management Task Force to oversee efforts to improve the capability and efficiency of  both organic  and  contrac› tual depot maintenance for aeronautical systems.

In March 1978 the Readiness Project Office (RPO) published a disposition  plan  for  the  M551-the Sheridan  light  tank.  It  in› structed Army commands to dispose of M55ls in place except for the quantity needed for the National Training Center and for U.S. forces  remaining in  Korea.  In January 1981  ODCSLOG directed DARCOM  to  reevaluate  the  initial  disposition.  ODCSLOG  pro› posed several  possible alternatives:  the  potential  requirements for active U.S. forces at Fort Benning, Georgia, in the Anti-Armor Mis› sile Division of  the Infantry School and at  Fort McClellan, Alabama, in the Smoke Generator Company of  the Chemical School; Foreign Military Sales of M55ls in Korea and CONUS on an "as is, where is"  basis;  and use  of assets stored in  USAREUR for hard targets. TRADOC studied the question once more and came to the same conclusion:  there were  no  proposed  uses  for  the vehicle.  On  30 April Secretary of Defense Weinberger offered all excess M551s in the Army inventory-1,089-to the Republic of Korea for $10,000 each. By the end of  the fiscal year, the Korean government had not requested a letter of  offer, and it appeared that the govern› ment might not desire any of  the Sheridans or only a limited quan› tity.

## Transportation

In the area of  transportation two themes dominated during fis› cal  year  1981.  One  was  a  traditional  theme found  in all military forces: to develop better equipment and to refine doctrine. The sec› ond was primarily organizational, although it too had doctrinal im› plications.  The Department of Defense, in particular the  Deputy Secretary of Defense,  Mr.  Carlucci,  decided that joint commands provided  a  more  effective  and  economic  method  of organizing transportation than separate service commands.

On 24  July 1981 the  Joint Chiefs of  Staff  agreed to integrate the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) and the Military Sealift Command (MSC) in order to improve the movement of mil-

itary units and cargo in peacetime and war.  The integrated com› mand would report through the JCS to the Secretary of Defense. The JCS formed  a special  task  force  made  up  of representatives from the services to develop an implementation plan. On 10 August 1981  the Deputy Chief  of  Staff for Logistics formed an Army task force to develop Army positions.  Mr. Carlucci signed a memoran› dum to the service secretaries and the  Joint Chiefs on 16 September 1981 approving the integration of  the two commands and establish› ing l October 1982 as the date by which integration should be com› plete.

On 30 June 1981  Mr. Carlucci directed the Army and Navy to develop a joint plan  to transfer seal  if   cargo along with  passenger t bookings and  related  contract administrative  functions  from  the Military Sealift Command (MSC) to the Military Traffic Manage› ment Command (MTMC) by I  October 1981.  Lawrence J.  Korb, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics, gave the Army the responsibility to develop the initial draft of  the plan. On 1 September 1981 the services forwarded the joint plan  to Dr.  Korb.  The Army  recommended the  transfer of functions as directed; the Navy recommended holding the transfer of  functions in abeyance and forwarding the plan to the  JCS special task force for consideration in developing the MSC and MTMC in› tegration plan. The  joint  plan left several issues unresolved, namely, funding,  personnel, and dates  by which  MTMC and MSC  would accomplish  specific  actions.  On  16  September  Mr.  Carlucci  ap› proved the  joint plan, and on 25 September Dr. Korb directed the establishment of Military Export Cargo Offering and Booking Of› fices (MECOBO) worldwide by 31 October. MTMC and MSC per› sonnel would staff the offices under the supervision of  MTMC. The Navy would select the MSC personnel. Dr. Korb directed the Army to submit a detailed staffing plan for the functional  transfer by  15 October.  It was  to identify military and civilian  personnel require› ments by grade and position, the source (MSC or MTM  C) of  person› nel  who  would  actually  fill  positions  in the  MECOBOs,  and any shortages of  personnel.

Mr. Carlucci also directed that the services implement a plan for consolidating personal property shipping offices, first in the continental United States and then overseas. Consolidated Book› ing Offices (CBO) will  provide a central point for booking ship› men  ts  with  the  carrier  industry  on  behalf of  multiple transportation offices. Local transportation offices wi11  retain the function of  dealing directly with service members and their fam› ilies  about to  change station.  The creation  of CBOs will  bring greater discipline  into  the  moving  industry since  each  one will

have  the power to suspend or disqualify carriers for a wider re› gion.

On  20  February  1979  the  Defense  Audit  Service  recom› mended that the  Military  Airlift  Command (MAC)  transfer  its Category B (planeload charter) flights,  used to carry Army per› sonnel and their families  overseas, from  military  to commercial terminals.  Congressional  hearings supported the  recommenda› tion,  and the  Air staff reduced MAC's 1981  budget submission to reflect the change. MAC had made limited use of commercial terminals for the  Philadelphia-Mediterranean routes since  1975 and the  Los Angeles-Philippine routes since October 1979.  On 4January 1981  MAC opened its first inland commercial gateway at St.  Louis  with  routes  to  Korea and Japan.  Mr.  Carlucci  ap› proved a  MAC  plan  to  transfer operations  to  commercial  ter› minals  on 23 March  1981.  The  plan  would  close  terminal operations at Travis Air Force Base and McGuire Air Force Base and designate them as  readiness terminals.  In September MAC selected  Oakland  to  replace  Travis  as  a  gateway  to Japan and Korea,  effective  1 January  I  982.  By  the end  of the  fiscal  year MAC  had not found  a  replacement for  McGuire.  Commercial gateways  in  peacetime  provide  cost savings  and  increased  con› venience  for  military  passengers,  but they  also  involve  certain disadvantages,  such  as  the  loss  of military  billeting,  of medical and other support, and of the ability to meet wartime require› ments easily.

The Office of the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Logistics, as DA executive agent for the military customs inspection program, be› gan a  review of the program in  November  1979, which  it com› pleted  and  forwarded  to  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of Defense for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, and Logistics (Program Management) in March 1981. The review recommended that the Department of Defense continue its program with no changes in the  existing  procedures  for  cargo,  ships, and  aircraft; that ODCSLOG refinements to the preclearance procedures for pas› sengers and their baggage be implemented; and that the existing selective enforcement program be expanded to promote greater efficiency.  ODCSLOG  also  proposed  eliminating  customs  in› spections of mail posted from APO or FPO facilities and bound for the customs territory of the United States. The Deputy As› sistant Secretary approved the conclusions and recommendations on 5 May  1981, and the U.S. Customs Service concurred on 27 May.

Implementation of refinements to the preclearance parts of

the program began during fiscal year 1981. Prior to August 1978, military customs inspectors (MCI) examined all  DOD air passen› gers and their baggage before their departure. The absence of U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) accreditation  for  this program resulted in additional inspections at the airports of  entry into  the  customs  territory  of the  United  States.  Beginning  in August 1978, military customs inspectors began making inspec› tions approved by both the U.S. Customs Service (USCS) and the USDA at designated overseas bases,  thus  eliminating the  need for a second inspection. The changes in  1981  included a random selection  of passenger baggage  for  thorough  examination  with the rest receiving only brief inspection and passengers answering a few questions, changes which brought the DOD practices into conformity with those of the USCS and the USDA. By the end of 1981  the Pacific  Command had fully  implemented  the  new procedures, and European Command and Southern Command were preparing to do so. In addition the Department of Defense expanded the preclearance program to include military aircraft departing from Rota, Spain, and from  Howard Air Force Base, Panama. ODCSLOG anticipates expansion to other sites during fiscal  year  1982.

The selective enforcement program came from an effort by the  European  Command  to  reduce  manpower  and  other  re› sources  used  in  the  military  customs  inspection  program.  The European Command established criteria based on risk assessment to  determine which  personal  property shipments should be in› spected.  Selective enforcement used  permanently assigned per› sonnel as  military customs  inspectors rather  than  borrowed  or temporary duty personnel,  thus reducing overall manpower re› quirements.  uses approved  this  concept  in July  1980  for  im› plementation  in  the  European  Command  on  an  interim  basis pending assignment of  permanent personnel. The Army obtained the permanent spaces required and implemented the program at forty-one  USAREUR bases on a  permanent basis during fiscal year 1981. The Air Force programmed personnel for fiscal  year 1983,  and  the  Navy  studied  the  feasibility  of also  establishing permanent spaces. Following the adoption of the recommenda› tions in the ODCSLOG report on the military customs program, the Department of Defense expanded the selective enforcement program to include the Philippines and Guam in the Pacific Com› mand. The department plans to expand it to other areas in the Pacific  Command and to the Southern Command during fiscal year 1982.

A  DOD-sponsored group, chaired by  an  Army  ODCSLOG representative, and an ad hoc committee organized by the Joint Logistics Commander Conference QLCC) studied the feasibility of establishing a single service manager for DOD railroad equip› ment. The DOD committee was oriented toward transportation management  and  so  approached  the  single-manager  question from a  mobility  and  operational  viewpoint with  a  emphasis on equipment control, centralized funding,  and establishment of a rail  mobilization base for maximum use of resources in an emer› gency or in  wartime. The JLCC committee recommended that each service retain all  management, accountability, and funding responsibilities,  with  a  single  service  manager's office  of thirty people formulating policy and coordinating and assisting the ser› vices in  rail management. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense will  review the recommendations of the committees to determine if a  single  manager for  rail  transportation will  be cost  effective  in  view  of the  substantial  number  of personnel needed to put the concept into effect.

Changes in  transportation organization and procedures had one implicit aim:  to increase the nation's ability to move troops and civilians more efficiently in both peacetime and war. A num› ber of  Army studies focused explicitly on the movement of  troops in  emergencies.  In  the past,  deployment plans focused on  rein› forcement by air until the first ships began arriving in the theater of operations. The current shortage of airlift capacity has made Army planners turn to sealift as an alternative. Both Army and Navy plans until fiscal year 1981 assumed sea deployment would begin at M plus  IO  or later. To improve this situation,  General Gregg (DCSLOG until  31 July  1981) initiated the CONUS Mo› bility Analysis, a study of  the movement of  Army units from home base  to  the  port of embarkation.  The analysis  helped  identify areas for  improvement in  the  movement system  from  the time the units are notified until they arrive at  port and board the ships, specified  ways  to improve the Army's deployment posture, and resulted  in  the  dispatch  of appropriate directives  to  the  major commands and a coordination of efforts by various agencies on the Army staff. FORSCOM incorporated many of these actions into  Emergency  Deployment  Readiness  Exercises  (EDRE)-an› nual logistics maneuvers in which each Army TOE unit packs up and moves to the point of embarkation with minimal or no ad› vance notice. The Army staff revised  the regulatory guides and regulations for movement planning and integrated the changes into operational planning.

ODCSLOG  initiated  three  programs  to  reduce  the  time needed to move a selected force from its  home base or, in  the case of  National Guard or Army Reserve units, from mobilization stations to a port of  embarkation. The  Joint Deployment Agency QDA) sponsored a fourth program. The first program involved the  purchase  and  storage  at  deployment  stations  of blocking, bracing,  packing,  crating, and tie-down (BBPCT) materiel  that local commercial stores would not have available in enough time or quantities to support the mobilization or deployment mission. The home installations would canvass designated sources yearly to make sure that sources and stock  levels  remained adequate. The second program concerned upgrading the loading and re› ceiving facilities  of selected  installation sites.  It provided funds to  upgrade  the  loading facilities,  ramps,  hardstands,  trackage, bridge plates, and hand tools necessary to load equipment. The third program involved the establishment of pre-positioned per› mits for the movements of basic load ammunition for the Army component of the Rapid Deployment Force through previously designated surface ports of embarkation.  ln  peacetime the De› partment of Defense ships  all  ammunition  overseas  from  four military ammunition ports,  two  on the West Coast and two on the East Coast. In wartime this system would be too cumbersome. Units would have to deploy carrying their own ammunition. The permits allow  them  to  move  through commercial seaports with live  ammunition.  By  the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  pre-positioned permits were in place for all the major Army combat units of  the Rapid  Deployment  Force.  ODCSLOG, working in  conjunction with  other Army staff agencies,  FORSCOM,  MTMC,  and the Coast  Guard,  was  developing  permits  for  combat support and combat service support units.  ODCSLOG anticipated  it would complete these permits and have them in place by the end of  the first quarter of fiscal  year 1982. The program sponsored by the Joint Deployment Agency sought to enhance rapid deployment by developing an automated data processing transportation net› work that would connect the command and control levels of the JCS,  the Joint Deployment Agency,  and the transportation  op› erating agencies at installations and depots with mobilization and deployment installations. JDA planned to brief the appropriate commands and staffs on the concepts by December 1981.

The high volume of fire on the modern battlefield with the resulting equipment damage and loss poses real problems in pro› viding adequate  resupply.  One possible  solution  is  to  ship am› munition, spare parts, and component parts in containers rather

than as  individual  items.  Such  a  procedure  would  shorten  the turnaround time by decreasing the time needed to load and un› load  vessels  and  would  lessen  constraints  on  moving  supplies through the theater logistics system. Logisticians liken the process to pouring a substance through a funnel with a wide mouth and a  very narrow neck.  Every point at which supplies must be han› dled provides an opportunity for friction and delay, for example, damaged unloading ramps at a depot or major mechanical failure in the trucks of a  transportation battalion.

On 10 June 1981  Brig.  Gen. Francis J.  Toner, the Director of Transportation, Energy, and Troop Support in  ODCSLOG, and  Maj.  Gen.  Vincent M.  Russo,  the Director of Plans,  Force Structure, and Systems also in ODCSLOG, cosponsored a general officer review of  Army containerization efforts. The participants discussed  many  important areas of concern including funding, equipment, maintenance, operations, and personnel and drew up a  list  of questions  for  further  investigation.  General  Toner di› rected  that  various  major  Army  commands and  staff agencies provide information or make detailed studies to answer the ques› tions.  Their  responses  arrived  in  August  and  September and formed the basis for a  comprehensive information paper on the Army containerization program. The paper set forth the goal of the program: to ensure that the Army uses the most efficient and cost-effective container systems available.

During fiscal year 1981 DARCOM shipped an average of 160 containers of ammunition to Europe each  month. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessel American Ranger transported most of the containers.  Sufficient numbers of military standard con› tainers (MILVANs) existed to allow  DARCOM to use them ex› clusively. No commercial containers were required.

The United States Army, Europe (USAREUR), made several proposals to increase the use of the Containerized Ammunition Distribution System (CADS).  USAREUR proposed increases of from 160 containers per month to 350 or 400 per month to take advantage  of shorter  turnaround times,  decreased demurrage, and  increased throughput  to forward  areas.  Use of containers added to the cost of shipping-about $105 for each short ton. In an effort to figure  more accurately  the cost and savings as› sociated  with  CADS,  USAREUR  proposed and  Headquarters, Department of the Army, approved a  test scheduled for  April 1982 in which the Military Sealift Command will carry 400 CADS containers to Europe. The test will also determine Europe's  abil-

ity  to  handle  this  higher  volume  of containerized ammunition and will  establish the level of CADS to be used in the future.

The Strategic  Mobility  Division  of ODCSLOG determined that the Army had only half the capacity it needed to move sup› plies and equipment onto a  beachhead, referred to as  logistics› over-the-shore (LOTS), given the various contingency plans for worldwide  operations.  ODCSLOG  programmed  additional watercraft  to  overcome  the  deficiency  for  fiscal years 1983 through  1987  in  the  Program  Objective  Memorandum.  The Army and the  Navy  agreed  to  Navy  support for  Army  LOTS operations using the Navy Auxiliary Crane Ship as a temporary container  discharge  facility  (TCDF).  ODCSLOG  prepared  re› quirements documents for the TCDFs and the new generation of watercraft, the commercial landing craft, the logistic support vessel,  and  the heavy amphibian.  The documents were nearing completion at the end of  the fiscal year. During 1981, 0 DCSLOG also  reviewed  the  USAREUR  Marine  Reserve  Fleet at  Hythe, England, for possible redistribution to support Army units in the Rapid  Deployment  Force.  ODCSLOG activated one additional Lighter Amphibious Resupply Cargo detachment. The craft has a  sixty-ton cargo capacity.  ODCSLOG anticipated activation of two more companies (four detachments).

The Transportatjon School at Fort Eustis,  Virginia,  will  re› ceive the first  two production models of the amphibious lighter air-cushion vehicle (LACV). Designated the LACV-30, the new vehicle moves on a cushion of  air.  It is  76.7 feet long,  36.9 feet wide, and weighs 115,000 pounds; it uses an average of 260 gal› lons of fuel  per hour and has a  maximum over-the-water speed of  fifty-seven miles per hour. It can move thirty-ton cargoes from ships  to  shore  or even  further  inland  if port facilities  are  un› available.  During  fiscal  year  1981 the  Transportation  School trained the first class of  twenty-five soldiers to operate, navigate, and maintain the lighters in a fifteen-week course.

The Logistics Evaluation Agency (LEA) completed a study of the use of the floating army maintenance facility (F AMF), a con› cept used in Vietnam, to support the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF). The Military Sealift Command (MSC) developed the idea of using a  barge as a  tender.  At the end of the fiscal  year the Marine Corps was examining the MSC concept, called Bartender, to  support Marine  Corps aviation  equipment.  An  Army repre› sentative at LEA was analyzing it for use in support of the Rapid Deployment Force  as  the  year closed.  The  Office  of Aviation Logistics  in  ODCSLOG  will  analyze  and  evaluate  both  studies

and send them to DARCOM and FORSCOM for comment. On the basis of this information the office will prepare a recommen› dation for  the  DCSLOG on the future  use  of floating  mainte› nance facilities by the Army.

After a briefing to the Army Staff  Council on 8 October 1980, the Army began funding a program to modernize the nontactical vehicle-formerly the utility vehicle-fleet, which had required too many  replacements caused by  a  lack of procurement funds during recent years.  Approval of an amended fiscal  year  1982 budget request and a functional program deployment increment package for the fiscal year 1983- 1987 Program Objective Mem› orandum should eliminate replacement requirements thereafter. Congress did not support a fiscal year 1981 supplemental request which would have accelerated nontactical vehicle modernization.

ODCSLOG initiated a proposal to delegate leasing authority to DARCOM so that all inventory activities wouid be located at the same headquarters. The office hoped to begin implementa› tion during the first quarter of  the new fiscal year. It  also reviewed all  management functions as they related to nontactical vehicles. The study concluded that while  the current structure was  ade› quate, ODCSLOG should incorporate all  nontactical vehicle re› quirements  in  the  Planning,  Programming,  and  Budgeting System. The office increased its participation in developing the Army Materiel Plan and specification reviews to ensure that user needs were met. ODCSLOG asked the major commands to con› sider adopting  the  TRADOC-FORSCOM  Automated  Vehicle Management Information System  in  order to facilitate  the col› lection of data about nontactical vehicles. ODCSLOG increased its overall liaison effort with the General Services Administration (GSA), which helped convince GSA to relocate its vehicles so that the Army might avoid the cost of some commercial leases.

Several  Army  installations,  including  Fort  Campbell,  Ken› tucky, and Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois, lost rail service because branch  lines  serving  the  installations  were  abandoned. Fort Campbell leased, with an option to buy, the eighteen-mile branch line  which  serves  it.  Rock  Island  Arsenal  decided  to  acquire  a small section of  track to connect it with the Burlington Northern Railroad and replace its dependence on the bankrupt Rock Island Railroad, which discontinued service. Camp Edwards, Massachu› setts,  Fort  Indiantown  Gap,  Pennsylvania,  and  Fort  Dix,  New Jersey, were on branch lines being considered for abandonment by the serving carriers. These installations faced a  possible per› manent loss of service because the present and foreseeable vol-

ume of rail  shipments was  too  low  to justify either the lease  or acquisition  of the line or a  subsidy  for  the carrier.  ODCSLOG planned to fill  peacetime and mobilization requirements by using trucks.

## Facilities, Construction, and Real Property

The  Military  Construction,  Army  (MCA),  line  of the  De› partment of Defense budget provides funds for the construction of facilities. Major  categories  include  operation  and  training; maintenance and production; research, supply,  and administra› tion; hospital and other medical construction; troop housing and community support; utilities,  land  improvements, and pollution abatement; planning and design, minor construction, and access roads;  and  NATO.  Major projects during  fiscal  year  1981  in› cluded an addition to Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, and renovation  of the  existing  structure and  the construction of a multiple-story permanent hospital at Fort Carson, Colorado.

The history of the FO  RSCO  M portion of the MCA program for fiscal year 1981 illustrates the vicissitudes that go into arriving at the final  military construction figure.  FORSCOM submitted its part of  the fiscal year 1981  MCA program to the Department of  the Army in February 1978. It consisted of  sixty-six command› sponsored projects costing some  $215  million  and  represented those tasks considered most pressing by  both FORSCOM head› quarters and the installation  commanders.  In June  1978  FOR› SCOM  revised  the  list  to  forty-one  projects  with  an estimated cost of $262 million, and a second time in March 1979 to sixty› three projects costing some $205 million. However, insertions of previously deferred projects and changing priorities continued, as  in  past  years,  to pare down  the  recommended list.  After in› tensive review by agencies in Washington, only three of  the orig› inal projects remained as the program went forward to Congress. Congress began hearings on the total 1981 program in April 1980 and completed passage of both the authorization and appropri› ation bills by  1 October 1980. President Carter signed both bills into law later that month. This legislation gave U.S. Army Forces Command $272 million in authorizations-not including minor construction-and $184 million in appropriations to fund forty› six  projects,  including  minor construction.  Thirty-two of these projects,  which  were  estimated  to  cost  $12  million,  were  sup› ported by the command.

The fiscal  year  1981  and  1982 programs suffered from nu-

merous deferrals  made  in  the  fiscal  year  1979  and  1980  pro› grams.  Administration  budget cuts  and  overall  lower  funding guidance by the  Department of the Army led to even more de› ferrals; as in previous years, the initial thrust for development of the fiscal  year  1982 program was in  the reprogramming of pre› viously deferred projects. In April 1981, the Reagan administra› tion  submitted a  budget amendment which  reduced  the  fiscal year  1982  program to $256 million.  It based the reduction on an anticipated lower rate of  inflation and on savings from changes in  the administration of the  Davis-Bacon  Act.  The FORSCOM portion  of this  program  contained  some  forty-one  command› sponsored projects for a total cost of $153  million.

Although the deficiencies  that resulted  from  underfunding military  construction  in  the continental  United States  were se› rious,  the situation was  not yet critical.  In Europe, however, the situation was more acute. General Frederick  J. Kroesen, the Com› mander in Chief of USAREUR, complained:

The inadequacies of troop housing, the shortage of  famjly housing, the make› shift,  unsatisfactory,  unhealthy  working conditions for large segments of the command, the exorbitant backlog of maintenance  of repair projects  all  con› tribute to a cancerous drain on the morale and commitment of the force as a whole.

USAREUR was short some 15,000 barracks spaces in 1981. The deficiency was  made up by  putting six  men  in  four-man  rooms and five  men  in three-man  rooms. The facilities  were all  quite old with  two exceptions,  the  Berlin  brigade  post  and  the  new brigade post at Osterholz-Scharmbeck in the north-both built and maintained by the German government.  All  the others be› longed to  the pre-World War II German Army. The oldest, a kaserne  (small  post area),  dated  from  the  fourteenth  century. Most, however,  were  built  during  the  Franco-Prussian  War (1870-1871) and after,  through  the  I 930s.  The working con› ditions in the maintenance shops and supply rooms at these in› stallations suffered  from  inadequate  heating,  lighting,  and plumbing. The Army had tolerated expedients in the past simply because it regarded duty in  Germany as temporary.

The situation was most appalling in the area of  family housing. The command was short some 8,000 housing units for  families authorized  to  come  to  Europe.  The dependents  had  to  either remain  in  the  United  States  or live  on  the  local  economy.  In addition some  23,000 young soldiers who were not authorized to bring their families at government expense brought them any› way.  They lived  off-post in  substandard  "ghetto" housing.  On-

post  housing  was  poorly  designed  and  cheaply  constructed.  It dated from the 1950s when the Army still contemplated a short stay  in  Europe.  Maintenance and  operations budgets  were  un› derfunded. In 1981 a $500-million maintenance backlog existed. In practical terms this meant families were living in houses where inadequate  heating systems  had  not  been replaced,  doors and windows  leaked,  and  plumbing  systems  could  not support  the automatic dishwashers that the Army installed. General Kroesen first  became familiar with  the problem when he was made com› manding general of VII Corps in July 1975. After a  tour of the corps area he observed that "if  someone told me we were going to suffer a  Warsaw  Pact attack  on  Christmas  Day,  I  would still say  family  housing is  our No.  1  problem."  His estimate  of the seriousness of the situation  had not changed in  the intervening period, but he was more optimistic that a solution would be found in the future. In 1981 the problem attracted media attention and a  number of congressmen expressed concern.

Deterring a  conventional  attack  by  Warsaw  Pact  forces  or Soviet adventurism in other parts of the world depends not only upon  the  strength  of forward  deployed  forces  in  Europe  and Korea or the Rapid Deployment Force, but also on the ability of the  United  States  to  mobilize  a  technically  sophisticated  mass army in  time of crisis.  During 1981  that capability weakened as the position of certain basic industries in  the United States sad› dled  with obsolescent plants and  equipment,  such  as steel  and automobiles,  continued  to  decline  in  the  face  of foreign  com› petition. General David C.Jones, the Chairman of  the  Joint Chiefs of Staff,  testified  in January 1981  before the Senate Committee on Armed Services that the  more  we  look  at  mobilization,  the  more  we  are  appalled  at  the  lack  of industrial  preparedness  in  the  country  and  the  procurement  problems  that result.  Because of low  procurement rates, not only do we have to spend more than we  should, but if we  tried to crank up this country in a  hurry and turn out things, we would find  we are limited in  many, many areas.

This problem, discussed at greater length in Chapter 3, is broad based, encompassing all of  society, and is clearly beyond the abil› ity of  even all  four military services working together to correct, let alone one.  Yet  the Army does what it can.  The Production Base Support portion  of the  Army's military construction pro› gram provides the necessary construction for the development, maintenance,  and retention  of an efficient  industrial  base.  Al› though five  procurement programs provide funds  for the con› struction of industrial facilities,  current work is  largely devoted

to the ammunition and tank programs. During fiscal  year 1981, the  Corps  of Engineers  placed  $82  million  under  contract  in projects.  The  ammunition  program  received  $70  million,  the tank  program  $12  million.  Approximately  $50  million  of the ammunition  program awards went  to the cargo metal-parts  fa› cility,  the administration  building,  and support facilities  at  the new Army ammunition plant in  Mississippi. Design continued on projects valued at about $275 million.

Congress appropriated a total of $10.17 million for construc› tion  of research,  development,  testing,  and  evaluation facilities in  fiscal  year  1981.  This figure included funds for  the following Army projects:

| Laser Test Facility, Camp A. P. Hill, Virginia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                            | $ 930,000   |

| Multiple-Use Instrument Sites, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico .... ............ ........ .. ......... ..... .... | 1,000,000   |

| Frost Effects Research Facility, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, New Hampshire............            | $6,100,000  |

The Military Construction, Army Reserve (MCAR), program provides for the design and construction of  facilities for the Army Reserve's training needs and mobilization mission. Typical facil› ities  include  Army  Reserve  training  centers  (ARTCS),  organi› zational  maintenance  shops  (OMSs),  equipment  concentration sites (ECSs),  weekend training areas (WET  As), and annual train› ing facilities  (A  TFs).  During fiscal  year  1981,  the Corps of En› gineers  awarded  construction  contracts  on  projects  valued  at $42.2 million.  At the same time contractors completed work on projects costing $27.2 million.

The Corps' portion of the fiscal year 1981  Air Force Military Construction  Execution  Program  totaled  $548.1  million.  The Corps anticipated an award of $502.7 million, but only received $358.2 million. Criteria changes, redesigns, funding delays, and inadequate funding account for only a portion of the difference. The major cause was a  reprogramming action  that resulted in the deferment of fiscal  year 1981 projects valued at $102.9 mil› lion.  The Corps subsequently used  the majority of these  funds to  implement fiscal  year  197  9  and 1980 projects previously de› f  erred to allow the start of  construction during 1980 of  the space transportation system  (STS) launch complex at Vandenberg Air

Force  Base,  California.  Adding  the  $120.9  million  in  deferred projects,  total  execution  for  the  fiscal  year  1981  program amounted to $4  79.2  million, or 95 percent of the forecast and 87  percent of the total  program,  falling just short of the  goal established  by  the  Office  of the  Secretary  of Defense.  Design continued on an Air Force program that involved outlays of  $1.26 billion for fiscal  year  1982 and $3.9 billion for  1983.

In  June the Corps halted design on MX projects totaling $365 million in fiscal year 1982 and $1.  7 billion in 1983 pending Pres› ident Reagan's decision on the basing mode. Organizational ef› forts  in support of the  MX  weapon system  continued with  the development  of the  Corps  of Engineers  MX  Program  Agency (CEMXPA).  Located  with  the  Air  Force  program  manager at Norton Air Force Base in California, CEMXPA is the outgrowth of  the South Pacific Division's  (SPD) role as the Army office with primary responsibility  for  the  MX.  It will  eventually become a separate field operating agency. In the late spring CEMXPA be› gan taking direct operational control of the program to include the $75 million MX test facilities under construction at Vanden› berg Air Force Base, as well as design of  the fiscal year 1982 and 1983  deployment  facilities,  totaling  approximately  $2  billion. CEMXPA worked through ten existing Corps divisions, districts, and  laboratories  to  manage  this  sizable  workload.  In June  the effort  came  to  a  halt  pending  President  Reagan's decision  on basing.  At the close of the fiscal  year the President had not yet announced his preference, but CEMXPA anticipated a substantial reduction of the program.

The Corps of  Engineers also did work for various Department bf Defense agencies.  The total  amount of construction awards for each  agency in  fiscal  year  1981  was  as follows:

| Defense Logistics Agency . .. ......... . ........ . .. .   | $ 4,349,000   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Defense Mapping Agency.................... .... .           | 1,500,000     |

The Corps of Engineers has had almost total control of the Department of Defense Recruiting Facilities Program since fiscal year 1980, when the General Services Administration (GSA) re› classified recruiting offices from general-purpose to special-pur› pose spaces and delegated five-year  firm-term  leasing authority

to the Corps. During fiscal year 1981, the Corps completed 1,853 actions related to the program. They included the establishment of new offices and the relocation, expansion, and upgrading of existing offices. As of 30 September 1981  the four services were operating approximately 7,500 recruiting offices.

In  1979  the  U.S.  government embarked on a  policy  of in› creased military presence in the Indian  Ocean and the  Persian Gulf to include the construction of facilities  in  the sultanate of Oman. The Corps of  Engineers will construct facilities using U.S. appropriated  funds  at  four  locations:  Masirah  Island,  Khasab, Thumrait, and Seeb.  As of 30 September 1981  the Corps had awarded three construction contracts, two at Masirah Island at a  programmed amount of $82.5 million and one at Khasab pro› grammed for $3 million.  The Khasab construction was  supple› mented by $1.8 million from Foreign Military Construction Sales funds for an extended runway and parking apron at Khasab air› field.

In addition to construction of  a Rapid Deployment  Joint Task Force (RDJTF) contingency facility  in  Oman, the Corps of En› gineers is  the  construction agent for  an austere staging base at Ras Banas, Egypt. The estimated program value over four fiscal years  is  $500  million.  Under a  U.S.  Air Force foreign  military sales case,  the Egyptian Air Force purchased forty  F-16 fighter planes from the United States. The Corps of Engineers assisted the Egyptian Air Force and the  United States Air Force in the design of facilities at An Shas Air Force Base, Egypt, to support these aircraft. In addition, the Corps provided soil investigation, designed the foundations of  microwave towers, and began design of a cargo terminal.

In addition to the other services and DOD agencies, the Corps of Engineers  provided  support  to  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey (USGS) in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, and to the State Department in Moscow, USSR. The Corps continued work on the design of the $65-million  U.S.  Geological  Mission,  a  project which  is  funded by  the  U.S.  government.  On  4  August  1980  Secretary  of the Army Clifford L. Alexander directed the Chief of Engineers to assign  four  construction  engineers  to  assist  the  Department of State  in  building a  new  U.S.  embassy  complex  in  Moscow.  All four had reported to duty by May  1981.

At the close of fiscal  year 1981  the Department of the Army controlled approximately  11,918,088 acres of land,  which  had cost $16.8 billion with improvements. During the fiscal year, the General Services Administration disposed of  2,556 acres of  Army land and improvements in the United States, which had cost $9.5

million.  In addition,  the Army declared excess and reported to the  General  Services  Administration for  disposal  78,377  acres and improvements which had cost $183.1  million to acquire and build. At the end of  the fiscal year there were 42,628 outstanding grants covering 7.2 million acres of Army and Air Force lands. One disposal action was particularly significant because it marked the first time the Army turned a major installation over to a state to encourage the creation of  jobs in an area of high unemploy› ment.  In July  1981  Paul  W. Johnson, the Deputy Assistant Sec› retary  of the  Army  for  Installation  and  Housing,  presented  a deed for the Michigan  Army Missile  Plant to the Michigan Job Development Authority. In exchange he accepted for the Army two buildings at the Detroit Arsenal constructed by the state of Michigan at an estimated cost of  $25 million. The Army expected to increase efficiency and save energy by consolidating its activ› ities at the Detroit Arsenal. Michigan sought to boost its economy by using the plant for automobile manufacturing. At the end of the fiscal year the state was negotiating an agreement with Volks› wagen of  America. Michigan expected to create 5,000 new jobs.

During 1981  the General Services Administration prepared real  property  surveys  on  twenty-one  Army holdings,  including two major properties:  Fort McClellan, Alabama, and Fort Indi› antown  Gap,  Pennsylvania.  In  eight  of the  reports,  GSA  rec› ommended that the Army declare land surplus. The total came to  2,209.2  acres.  The Army agreed  to classify  73  acres  excess and at the end of the year was still considering whether to add an additional 34.3 acres to this category. The 73 acres involved two properties: 60 acres at Byrd Field, Virginia, a National Guard facility, and 13 acres at  Wayland, Massachusetts, an Army Reserve facility and former  Nike site.

The Corps of  Engineers acquired land for the U.S. Air Force, U.S.  Department of the Interior,  and the  U.S.  Department of Energy during fiscal  year 1981. The Corps purchased land and improvements for air installation compatible-use zones (AICUZ) at eleven  Air Force bases.  Some three hundred acres were in› volved at a cost of  $1.7 million. The Corps continued to buy land for the Department of the Interior's Big Thicket National Pre› serve  in Texas.  The Corps' Beaumont Project Office obtained 199 tracts containing 5,134 acres at a cost of $5,952,674. These purchases brought total acquisitions through 30 September 1981 to  1,361  tracts,  consisting  of 71,833  acres  at  a  cost  of $67,676,605. Also in 1981  the Corps acquired 45 tracts encom› passing  90  acres  at  a  cost  of $34,439  for  the  Department  of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve program. Since the incep-

tion of the program the Corps had purchased  1,  140 tracts con› taining 4,882 acres at a  cost of $88.2 million.  For all  programs the Corps spent $1.7 million during 1981 in relocation assistance payments to 275 applicants displaced by its  land acquisition ac› tivities.

## Physical Security

In  June 1981 General Vessey, the Vice Chief  of  Staff, directed Lt. Gen. Richard G. Trefry, The Inspector General, to assess the Army's  capability to counter terrorism. Following an examination of policy,  procedures,  and  organization,  General  Trefry  con› cluded  that  the  concentration of all  matters pertaining to  ter› rorism under the  provost marshal  led to the widespread  belief that antiterrorist activities were a  military  police  responsibility, with the result that commanders and operational staffs were not as  involved  in this area as  they were in other operational issues. The growing evidence of a  terrorist threat against U.S. forces, particularly  in  West  Germany,  had  not  led  to  any  increase  of physical security at U.S. bases.  The only activity in this area, an upgrading of security at nuclear storage sites,  was an on-going process unrelated  to  recent developments.  General Trefry  rec› ommended that the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Op› erations and Plans take the lead in crisis management for terrorist actions.

Lt.  Gen.  Glenn  K.  Otis,  the  Deputy Chief of Staff for  Op› erations  and  Plans,  saw  the  issue  in broader terms:  Could  the Army defend itself against all  types  of criminal acts  including conventional  crimes  against persons  and  property,  demonstra› tions against the Army, and terrorist acts such as  the seizure of hostages  and  the  barricading  of terrorists  and  hostages  in  an office or building on an Army post or installation? General Otis argued that ODCSOPS should be the agency responsible for iden› tifying all problems and proposing solutions in this area. General Trefry agreed with this analysis, but Lt. Gen.  Robert K.  Yerks, the Deputy Chief  of  Staff  for Personnel, disagreed. Generals Otis and Yerks  then met with General Vessey to discuss the study by The Inspector General. General Vessey reaffirmed that the Dep› uty Chief of Staff for  Personnel was responsible for installation security, while responsibility for overall security of  the command rested with  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. DCSOPS was  entrusted with the authority to develop  plans  to integrate military forces  to counter all threats to the security of the  command,  including terrorism.  Based  on  General  Vessey's

decision, General Otis directed ODCSOPS to develop a compre› hensive plan to coordinate Army security efforts and keep them priority items on  the agenda of all  commanders by giving each of the technical channels reporting to  them some responsibility for security.

Shortly  thereafter,  General  Meyer,  the  Chief of Staff,  ex› pressed concern over the  potential  for  increased  civil  violence and disorder and directed the preparation of  a Civil Disturbance Action  Plan.  A  study  by  the  Military  Support  Division  of the Operations Readiness Mobilization Directorate in ODCSOPS re› vealed that both FORSCOM and the Military District of Wash› ington believed that they had enough troops to successfully carry out the civil  disturbance mission.  Both the National Guard and active forces received training as required. The Army possessed enough equipment for use in civil disturbances in the continental United States  both in units and  pre-positioned  in  depots.  The equipment was  in  good condition  except  that some  communi› cation equipment needed to be replaced. By the end of the fiscal year the Army was making the necessary corrections. Fina11y, the study found that current civil disturbance doctrine was still valid. General  Otis recommended and General  Meyer agreed that in the future ODCSOPS would consider civil disturbance planning as  part of the Security of the Army plan.

A  committee of ODCSOPS action  officers wrote a  draft of Army Regulation  30-20, "Security of the Army."  The AR at› tempted to eliminate the attitude that security is a provost mar› shal  function  instead of a  command function  by  requiring that the major commands direct their installations to prepare an op› eration plan that would meet several minimum conditions.  The operation plan would integrate all existing security measures into a  single command-directed plan. Each command would period› ically review  the adequacy of all security plans and procedures, particularly  those  concerning antiterrorism,  civil  disturbances, and crime  prevention,  in  the  light of possible  threats.  Concur› rently the commands would assess their vulnerability based on a review  of physical  security surveys,  counterintelligence and op› erational security evaluations, and crime prevention surveys and inspections  by  their  criminal  investigation  division.  Each  com› mand  would  establish  a  commandwide  security  awareness  and training plan with particular emphasis on combating subversion, terrorist sabotage, and criminal activity.  It would also assess an› nually civil disturbance training, equipment, and overall prepar› edness and hold semiannual command post exercises designed to train  installation  staffs  to  meet crises  precipitated  by  terrorists

and other subversive or criminal elements. The Army staff and the major commands were reviewing the draft of the AR at the end of the fiscal  year.

The increase in conventional crime on Army installations dur› ing 1981 led the Army to conduct a servicewide crime campaign from  7  to  21  September 1981.  Major areas of emphasis in  the campaign included  the security of barracks,  bachelor quarters, and family  residences;  the Army  Operation Identification Pro› gram, which entailed recording items of personal property and placing  an  identifying  code  on  each  item;  and  neighborhood watches,  which  involved  looking out for the safety and security of each  individual's property  and  that  of the  neighbors.  The objectives of the Army Crime Watch Campaign were to increase awareness concerning the nature and volume of burglaries and house breakings;  increase active  involvement in  securing troop billets,  senior enlisted and officer bachelor quarters, and family quarters; educate service members and families on practical, cost› free security measures that they could take to reduce opportu› nities for crimes against their living quarters and property; and encourage and assist neighbors to initiate collective measures to watch out for the security of each other's personal property and to report suspicious activities.  The Army Operation Identifica› tion  Program  introduced  a standard Armywide,  owner-applied numbering system for marking personal property. Service mem› bers and their families were to mark their personal property using the social security number of the service member with a  "USA" prefix.  The prefix  would  alert any  military or civilian law  en› forcement agency which recovered the property that it belonged to a member of the U.S. Army and that the individual could be located by using the Army World-Wide Locator System.

## 11.  Research, Development, and Acquisition

The Army's Research, Development, and Acquisition (RDA) effort suffered severe budget constraints until early 1981. Within lower-than-requested funding levels,  the Army tried to create a balance to achieve as great a degree of  near-term readiness, mod› ernization, maintainability, and mobilization as  possible. But, as stated  by  Lt.  Gen.  Donald B.  Keith,  Deputy  Chief of Staff for Research, Development, and Acquisition (DCSRDA), there were "significant  shortcomings  in  each  of these  areas."  During  the early  weeks  of 1981  the new  Reagan  administration  made  sig› nificantchanges in the budget request for fiscal year 1982. Within the  revised  budget, RDA dollars  were  substantially  increased. The increase funded the most serious shortcomings. Specifically such  programs as  the  Ml  tank,  the  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicle System,  Patriot,  DIVAD,  and Roland,  to  name  a  few,  were  in much better shape.

## Planning and Budgeting

The initial approved program (IAP) for fiscal year 1981  was based  on  the  President's budget of $4.234  billion,  adjusted  to reflect a "worst case" situation based on congressional actions of September  l 980. In addition  to deferrals for pending congres› sional reductions, constraints were placed on the Army research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) program by  the Un› dersecretary of  Defense for Research and Engineering (USDRE), who identified twenty-seven programs  as being of  special interest. These included defense research sciences, high-energy laser tech› nology, the infantry man-portable antiarmor weapon (IMAAWS), identification friend or foe  (IFF) radar development and equip› ment, division air defense command and control, Viper, aircraft electronic warfare self-protection system,  NAVSTAR global po› sitioning system, joint interoperability of tactical  command and control system QINTACCS),  Chaparral, and joint tactical com› munications (TRI-TAC).

IAP deferrals totaled $601.8 million, of which $528.2 million was  deferred  by  the  Office,  Secretary  of Defense  (OSD),  and $73.6 million by  the  Department of the  Army (DA).  OSD de› ferrals included the following significant programs: ba1listic mis› sile  defense  (BMD)  advanced  technology  ($10  million),  BMD

systems  technology  ($30  million), IMAAWS  ($21.3  million), SHORAD command and control ($15.4 million). tank gun ($57.2 million),  and  Chaparral  ($20.8  million).  DA  deferrals  included advanced attack helicopter (AAH) ($26.3 million), Hellfire ($10.3 million),  DIVAD ($8 million). and SOTAS ($6.2 million).

The final RDTE&amp;A appropriation, approved by Congress and signed by  the  President in  late  December  1980, amounted  to $3.087 billion,  $147  million  less  than  the  President requested. General reductions totaled $134 million, of which $120 million had been requested as a  hedge against inflation. The remaining $14-million net reduction included program cuts of $151.4 mil› lion, which  were largely offset by  specific program  increases of $137 million. Significant program changes included defense re› search sciences (-$12.4 million), missile and rocket components (+$6.2  million),  high  survivability  test  vehicle  (+$25  million), commander's  information executive system (-$8.4 million), Vul› can  product improvement (+$9.6  million), advance rocket con› trol system (+$29 million), corps support weapons system (+$7.2 million),  Army  helicopter  improvement  program  (+$20.9  mil› lion),  Hellfire fire and forget missile (+$6.9 million), and DAR› COM ranges test facilities (-$10 million).

Based on  guidelines of the new administration, a  fiscal year 1981  supplemental  was  submitted to Congress in  March  1981. This request reflected a  net increase of $79.5 million to the ap› propriation, which  was  subsequently reduced to $41  million by congressional  action.  The  major  change  imposed  by  Congress was  disapproval of the $32-rnillion increase requested for BMD systems  technology.  Three  major  fiscal  year  1981  reprogram› mings were approved by Congress during the year-interim tac› tical  electronic  processor  (+$7.498  million),  IFF  development (+$2.5 million), and a  classified project (+$2.2 million).

Zero-base budgeting remained the primary method for initial formulation of the RDTE&amp;A budget request for fiscal year 1982 submitted to and reviewed  by  OSD and 0MB during October and November 1980. OSD again expanded the Army's  five-band presentation  to  eight  bands  for  a more  detailed  display  of RDTE&amp;A programs.

The Army's RDTE&amp;A budget request of $3.557 billion for fiscal  year  1982 was  submitted to Congress in January  I  981.  In March 1981, based on new administration guidance and submit› ted concurrently with the fiscal  year 1981 supplemental request, an  amended  budget  was  proposed  increasing  the  Army's RDTE&amp;A fiscal  year 1982 request to $3.905 billion. During the period, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees con-

sidered the revised  1982 budget request. A special amendment was proposed but not ready for submission until after the begin› ning of fiscal  year 1982. As a  result, neither the fiscal year 1982 authorization bill  nor the appropriation bill had been cleared as of 30 September 1981.

At  the close  of the  fiscal  year,  RDTE&amp;A direct obligations represented 99.99 percent  of  fiscal year 1980 availability and 94.4 percent  of fiscal  year  1981  availability,  both of which  met  or exceeded OSD goals. Overall RDTE&amp;A disbursements for fiscal year  1980 were 92 percent and 57 percent for fiscal  year 1981, both of which were within OSD goals.

Work began in the first quarter of  fiscal  year 1981  to develop the first  HQDA Long Range RDA Plan (LRRDAP), which cov› ered fiscal  years  1983-1997. The objectives of the plan were to (1)  provide a document that integrated RDA planning into the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), (2) pro› duce a  coordinated plan that showed how  the Army would de› velop  and acquire  materiel  needed  to  fight  in  the  1990s and beyond, (3) create a mechanism to add stability to the RDA pro› cess, (4) invent a process that examined total resources available early in the development cycle, (5)  provide additional focus  for the Army's technology efforts, and (6)  establish a  link between the Army's five-year  program and the period ten years beyond.

TRADOC and DARCOM provided user and developer input for  the  LRRDAP in January  1981  based  on  requirements  de› veloped  from  the  TRADOC mission area analysis.  ODCSOPS reviewed  the  information  and  assigned  priorities,  and  then ODCSRDA formed a  plan.  The result,  LRRDAP  83-97,  was completed in July 1981.  It consisted of two volumes.  Volume I was a short summary-type document designed to be used by sen› ior decision makers. Volume II contained the details of the plan. Work began on LRRDAP 84-98 in early July 1981, and a draft version was sent to users and developers for comment on 25 July 1981.

The Army has been using the total risk assessing cost estimate (TRACE) successfully  for several  years  in  research  and  devel› opment (R&amp;D) to determine a project's  budget. Nine Army R&amp;D projects were funded in fiscal year 1981 using the TRACE budget concept. This year ODCSRDA initiated a study to evaluate the potential of applying the TRACE concept to procurement.

The obligation plan  for  the Army's procurement appropri› ation  for fiscal  year  1981  was  $11.956 billion.  This amount in› cluded $9.721  billion for direct Army procurement and $2.235 billion  for  reimbursable  customer sales.  The plan  included all

fiscal  year  1981  obi  igations  from  funds  appropriated  in  fiscal years  1979,  1980, and  1981. Actual obligations fell  short of the plan by  $159.8  million-$173.8 million  over the plan in direct funds  and  $333.6  million  under  for  reimbursable  funds.  The lapse  of funds  for  the expiring  fiscal  year  1979  program amounted to $108.9 million,  which  was  $71.4 million in  direct funds  (including approximately  $40  million  for  contingent  lia› bilities) and $37.4 million  in reimbursable funds.

Fiscal  year 1981 saw significant improvement in  funding for tactical and nontactical vehicle programs. The 1981 supplemental appropriation increased the budget for tactical wheeled vehicles from $226.9 million to $457.9 million.  A five-year contract was signed with AM General Corporation on 8 April 1981 to produce 11,394 M939-series  five-ton  trucks,  with  an option to increase production by  I 00 percent each year.  This vehicle wilJ  come in several  different  body  styles:  cargo,  dump,  tractor,  van,  and wrecker. The vehicles are urgently vequired to fill  shortages in troops units,  to meet interchange  requirements (that is,  support the fielding of  new systems), and to fill  POMCUS shortages. On 22 May 1981, a five-year contract was signed with Oshkosh Truck Corporation for 2,140 ten-ton trucks, with an option to increase production by 250 percent a year. This vehicle will come in cargo, tanker,  recovery,  and  tractor  versions.  Additional  competitive acquisition occurred for  M915Al commercial line haul tractors and numerous trailers and nontactical vehicles, including a small number of personal security  vehicles  (armored sedans)  for  key commanders in Europe because of terrorist threats.

## Science and Technology

The 1981  summer studies of the  Army  Science  Board and the Defense Science Board were "Equipping the Army in  19902000" and "Operational Readiness with High Performance Sys› tems,"  respectively.  The  first  provides  recommendations  to achieve a well-equipped, balanced force in the 1990s; the second provides  recommendations to assist  the  Army  in  achieving  ac› ceptable operational readiness rates on its high performance sys› tems.

The Army and the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) signed a  memorandum  of understanding (MOU)  initiating  the  DOD terrain-analysis  program.  DMA  will  produce  standard  terrain› analysis products while the Army will concentrate on turning out nonstandard terrain products for tactical and theater command› ers. The Army submitted the first formal digital terrain data base

requirement to  DMA to support weapons and  intelligence  sys› tems. A prototype is being put together for testing at Fort Lewis, Washington, early next year.  A significant updating of CONUS mapping requirements was made and submitted to DMA. Survey and assessment of  all requirements was completed by subordinate commands and  refined  at the Office  of the  Assistant  Chief of Staff for Intelligence (OACSI) to reduce many requirements and to  gear  mapping efforts  toward  priority  operational  plans and major training areas.

The Waterways Experiment Station (WES) started the airfield damage repair project for  fiscal  year  1981  by concentrating on two repair materials: a well-graded crushed limestone that would be capped, once bomb craters were filled, and a liquid grout and stone mixture that would harden after being placed in the dam› aged areas. These two methods provided an interim solution that met NATO requirements. Combat engineering units field-tested both methods with satisfactory results.

A  proposal  to  redirect  the  airfield  damage  repair  project called for backfilling the bombed crater with debris, cutting the jagged crater edges to uniform size,  and then placing prefabri› cated matting or concrete slabs as the surface layer rather than using a  limestone and grout-stone  fill.  Advantages of the pro› posed  method  would  include  less  work  and  fewer  personnel, greater  permanency,  all-weather  application,  and  faster  repair completion. WES is currently investigating the possibility of per› fecting water-jet cutters so  that they  can cut the thick  concrete required.

The U.S. Army Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration's (NOAA) National  Ocean Survey jointly sponsored the  Atlantic Remote Sensing Land-Ocean experiment (ARSLOE) during Oc› tober and November 1980. Working groups from federal agen› cies  and  official  participants  from  Canada,  France, Japan,  and Norway converged on CERC's Field  Research  Facility (FRF) at Duck,  North Carolina,  for a  two-month research effort to gain knowledge on how ocean waves are transformed as they move to shore, to improve storm prediction techniques, and to verify data› collection  methods.  Both traditional oceanographic meters and the more recent remote sensing technology were included among the sensors used in  ARSOLE. Three test sites were used during the  experiment:  the  Elizabeth  City  area  for  land  features,  the mouth  of the  Chesapeake  Bay  for  ocean  fronts,  and  the  FRF facility  pier at Duck for  waves.  During the experiment a  storm blew  up on  23  October that lasted  five  days.  Researchers now

have a "captured" storm, well documented with growth and de› cay  of waves,  energy  transfer, and the effect of winds  blowing with  and  against  the  direction  of the  waves.  This  represents unique data for use in oceanographic research.

The first of  a series of  field experiments, Snow-One, was con› ducted from  5 January  to  13  February  1981.  The  U.S.  Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory,  Hanover, New Hampshire, carried out the field experiment at Camp Ethan Allen Training Center in Vermont. Other Army commands and centers participated, as well  as  Navy,  Air Force, Marine Corps, and academic and commercial research  laboratories. Snow-One gave  electro-optical  systems  researchers,  developers,  and  man› agers an opportunity to establish an initial performance data base and to evaluate developmental hardware in a wet, cold environ› ment.  Measurements  were made  under conditions of rain, fog, and wet and dry snowfalls.

Results of Snow-One indicated that visibility through far in› frared  transmission  appeared  to  be  equally  affected  by  falling snow; snow cover could pose a problem to both infrared and near millimeter-wave  target location  and tracking systems;  transpor› tation and operation of modular universal laser equipment was very difficult  under winter conditions; and performance of the state-of-the-art snow  characterization instrumentation  used was excellent.

## Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)

A  variety of factors provided impetus to the BMD research and development program this year. Some of these factors were the growing uncertainty of this  nation's ability to influence the buildup of Soviet strategic weapons through negotiation, an in› creased awareness at all government levels of  the BMD potential and the significant contributions it could make in  the offensive› defensive strategic equation, confidence based on successful ex› perimental and analytical verification of BMD concepts and hard› ware since the deactivation of the Safeguard system in 1976, and the decision  to proceed with full-scale engineering development of the Air Force MX system.  The BMD organization,  in  its  re› search and development efforts, emphasized the more advanced, maturing projects in both the Advanced Technology and Systems Technology Programs.

The efforts of the more mature Advanced Technology Pro› gram included the designating optical tracker program, the en› doatmospheric nonnuclear kill  program, the forward acquisition

program, the optical aircraft measurements program, the mini› ature kill  vehicle  technology program, investigation of directed energy weapons, investigation of the applicability of  distributed data  processing,  preparation  of a  millimeter-wave  radar,  and preparation of the Cobra Judy.

The designating  optical  tracker  program  provided  data  to verify  the capability of long wavelength infrared sensors to  per› form generic BMD functions of  designation and tracking under realistic  conditions  of engagement and  the  environment.  Four flights in the program have successfully deployed the sensor  above the atmosphere and obtained the required data on reentry tar› gets. In fiscal year 1981 plans were completed for the remaining flights.  Plans were also developed for future use of the program hardware.

The purpose of  the endoatmospheric nonnuclear kill program is  to  establish  a  coordinated technology  base  to  demonstrate a homing guided intercept and  nonnuclear kill  of representative reentry  vehicles  in  the  endoatmosphere.  The BMD Advanced Technology Center (BMDATC), faced with budget cuts and other priorities for fiscal  years  1981  and  1982, reduced this program to development of  critical component hardware. Development of critical component hardware progressed, as did the effort to up› grade the three-degrees-of-freedom simulation to a  six-degtees› of-freedom  high  fidelity  simulation.  BMDATC  initiated design and validation  of a  gas  reaction  maneuver  control  system  and began warhead-target interaction ground rocket sled tests.

The forward  acquisition  system  program  showed  progress. The program is an integrated technology effort designed to re› solve  critical  system  and  technology  issues  associated  with  the BMD  forward  acquisition  function  through  a  comprehensive ground test program. All necessary hardware was placed under contract and an integration contractor selected. The contractor will also furnish a wide-field-of-view, longway infrared test cham› ber.

The miniature kill  vehicle program,  which  ended  this  fiscal year, developed solutions to technology issues concerning appli› cation of the homing interceptor (spinning kill vehicle) concept. This year's effort demonstrated that the regenerative piston in› jection liquid propulsion engine would meet requirements of  mis› sion  durability and spin  environment.  Designs  were completed for both a  tactical  tracking sensor and a  data processing system to  permit  vehicle  operation  in  high-target density and  nuclear environments. The kill  vehicle requirements were updated con-

currently with  evolving threat descriptions, and a miniature kill vehicle responsive  to the scenarios was  designed.

Directed energy weapons exploiting either high-energy laser or particle beam technology have  considerable potential for fu› ture BMD application. Space, aircraft, ground, and hybrid basing concepts have been investigated. Army BMD interest focused on space-based concepts offering unique  potential  for  the  engage› ment and destruction  of both  intercontinental  ballistic  missiles (ICBM)  and  sea-launched  ballistic  missiles.  BMDATC  analyses indicated a  definite  preference  for  use  of space-based  directed energy weapons as  the leading edge of a  multiple-layer defense system. These investigations emphasized the use of high-energy lasers because of  a lag (on a relative basis) in  particle beam tech› nology.  Using simulated ICBM  components, the BMDATC suc› cessfully demonstrated viable kill mechanisms for the space-based laser.  A number of high-energy laser candidates have been iden› tified  which,  if successfully  developed,  could  provide  the  basis for major increases in  the cost-effectiveness of any future  BMD space-based  laser  system.  In  addition  to  this  high-energy  laser activity, BMDATC continued to serve as technical manager and procurement agent for two efforts in the Defense Advanced Re› search Projects Agency's  particle beam program: the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory exoatmospheric neutral particle beam ac› celerator program and the Austin Research Associates collective ion accelerator proof-of-principle experiment.

BMDATC directed research to exploit, for BMD applications, the many potential advantages of  the distributed data processing computer concept, such as increased throughput, availability, re› liability,  fail-soft  capability,  growth capability,  and load sharing. Also investigated was use of distributed systems of microproces› sors interconnected with various schema. A six-micro-processor› by-twelve-memory-board distributed data processing system con› nected  by  a  crossbar switch  was  implemented,  and testing  was initiated. Investigation began of designs for ring and banyan in› terconnected systems. At BMDATC's  Advance Research Center, the Control Data Corporation 6400/7600 mainframe computers were augmented with  ten VAX  11/780 minicomputers to pro› vide a  distributed  data  processing capability.  This  testbed  was used to support multiple concurrent BMD distributed data pro› cessing experiments in  hardware architecture, algorithm devel› opment, and software engineering. Significant progress was made in the development of  a computer-aided design system to support development of high  quality  software for BMD systems,  which

will  most likely require fault tolerance and a high degree of  flex› ibility.

In fiscal  year  1981  component development and fabrication continued on a millimeter-wave radar for use at Kwajalein Missile Range (KMR) in  collecting data on BMD targets.  Major com› ponents, procured and  tested  in  the continental  United States, were shipped  to  Roi-Namur Island.  Installation of the antenna tower  and  radome  support  was  completed  in  July  1981.  Late delivery of drive gears for  the gear boxes delayed shipment of the  pedestal  and  caused a  slippage  in  the  original  operational date for the radar.

Preparation of Cobra Judy, a shipborne S-band radar signa› ture collection system to provide intelligence data for  the  U.S. Air  Force  Foreign  Technology  Division  (FTD) and  the BMDATC, also continued. For this effort, jointly funded by the Air Force Systems Command and the BMDA  TC, the U .S.S. Ob› servation  Island has  been outfitted and made seaworthy.  It now meets all  the  standards required for  the  Cobra Judy  platform. Construction of  a radar array turret was completed in 1981, and all  electronic, computer, and recording equipment was  installed on board the ship.

Major activity  in  the Systems  Technology  Program  focused on the definition and development of systems for two principal efforts: the endoatmospheric low-altitude defense (LoAD) system and the homing overlay experiment (HOE) with technology for an exoatmospheric interceptor. The Systems Technology Project Office (STPO) of the BMD Systems Command also worked to› ward integration of endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric con› cepts into a layered defense system and toward the collection of data to support systems studies and concept evaluations.

Design  and development of the  HOE, a  two-phase  demon› stration to prove technology associated with an exoatmospheric interceptor, showed significant progress. Critical design reviews of  flight experiment equipment and various hardware flight items were completed and fabrication  of flight  hardware was  begun. Development testing and  manufacture of the  first  HOE flight experiment units were completed for the axial propulsion system, the fixed-fragment-net kill mechanism, and the back-up kill mech› anism.  Fabrication of the first HOE interceptor flight hardware (FB-1) was initiated. The HOE simulation laboratory facility was completed for validating the HOE flight software by exercising flight experiment hardware and software in a dynamic hardware› in-the-loop  simulation.  Testing  of the  HOE  flight  experiment hardware was  begun during the last quarter of the fiscal  year.

Engineering and development problems appeared in  the sen› sor, requiring extensive management reviews and resulting in cost growth to  Lockheed's contract, but no delay  in  the HOE flight experiment schedule.  The  design  development  hardware  per› formed successfully in  laboratory tests for flight  vibration;  how› ever,  difficulties  continued  in  the  development  of the  test hardware for design verification.

All activities relating to KMR preparations for the HOE were on  schedule.  A  missile  access  stand  obtained  from  the  Navy's Polaris program with Lockheed was shipped to KMR and erected on Meck  Island.  Ground  support  equipment  for  the  HOE booster,  a  modified  Minuteman  I,  was  shipped  from  Hill  Air Force  Base.  Using  test  launch  software  at  Lockheed's Missile Space Center,  Lockheed and McDonnell  Douglas completed in› tegration tests to verify that the equipment was compatible with the interceptor ground test unit.

The  LoAD  system,  expected  to  be  valuable  in  defending either the MX missile or silo-based ICBMs, gained attention and support from  both  the  Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S.  Congress.  Early  in  the  year,  the Secretary of Defense ap› proved increased funding  by  approximately $346 million  to en› sure  LoAD  compatibility  with  the  MX  missile;  later,  Congress authorized an additional $15 million in  fiscal year  1981  funds to protect the option of  accelerating LoAD development.

The BMD organization and  the  Air Force  Ballistic  Missile Office worked together to ensure LoAD-MX compatibility. The two  signed  a  memorandum  of agreement on  7  October  1980 which  established a  formal  relationship, outlined policy and re› sponsibilities,  and  provided  for  the  exchange  of technical,  op› erational, and program  information.  Similar relations were established with the Air Force's  Strategic Air Command and Test and Evaluation  Command.  Later in  the  year,  ties  were  formed with the Defense Nuclear Agency for coordination and resolution of LoAD technical  issues  and  with  the  Department of Energy (DOE) for a joint feasibility study on a  nuclear warhead for the LoAD interceptor.

In  November  1980,  the  BMD  Systems  Command  changed the acquisition  strategy for  the  LoAD  effort  from  an  associate contractor  structure  to  a  prime  and  subcontractor  structure. McDonnell Douglas received the prime contract; Martin Marietta Aerospace, Orlando, and the Raytheon Company received major subcontracts for the interceptor and the sensor and engagement controller efforts, respectively.

Testing  to  refine  LoAD  definition  and  development  pro-

gressed.  High explosive testing was performed on a scale model of the LoAD defense unit, and wind tunnel testing was  done on the interceptor airframe configuration. The signature measure› ment radar installed at KMR to gather X-band signature data on incoming objects from ICBM flights was also tested.  The radar successfully tracked and recorded data on a  decoy that was spe› cifically designed and flown for the test.

The preservation  of location  uncertainty  (PLU) effort  was marked by closer cooperation between the Air Force's MX pro› gram and the Army's BMD LoAD program. LoAD representa› tives participated as full  members on all  Air Force PLU working groups. Definition of  PLU requirements for LoAD also received special attention in BMD studies.

Definition of a  BMD layered defense system  continued. Re› cent studies considered exoatmospheric, infrared nonnuclear in› terceptor technologies,  as  well  as  deep endoatmospheric, small radar, nuclear and nonnuclear interceptor technologies. A major study called "BMD Systems  for  the  Nineties"  added some cre› dence to earlier assumptions that technology for exoatmospheric defense  could  be  integrated  into  a  tactical  system  in  time  to counter the threat projected for  the coming decade,  provided such developments were successful.  The Undersecretary of De› fense for Research and Engineering requested a  BMD concepts study  that  would  rely  on  a  terminal  endoatmospheric defense with an early deployment capability and low technological risk.

Because  of the  complexity and expense  of existing overlay concepts,  the  BMD  program  manager  formed  a  task  force  to study overlay concepts which were less costly and less complex. The possibility of  a national decision to base the first MX ICBMs in silos  rather than in  multiple  protective shelters  underscored the need for an efficient defense system  that could balance the advantages of advanced technologies with the demands of a de› ployment schedule like  that of the MX  missile.  These require› ments,  together with the possibility of an early development of a  robust terminal defense  underlay,  led to several  new  overlay concepts still in the formulation stage.

Results of  the "Low Altitude Perturbation Study" funded by BMD  through  the  Air  Force's Foreign  Technology  Division, Wright Patterson AFB,  were presented at BMD Systems Com› mand (BMDSCOM) on 10 October 1980. A follow-up  meeting held at McDonnell Douglas on 15 October 1980 completed low› altitude trajectory data requirements for LoAD radar data pro› cessing specifications and analysis.  On  16  April  1981  represen› tatives  of Sandia  National  Laboratories,  BMDSCOM,  and  the

BMD contractors reviewed "white papers" on projected maneu› verable reentry vehicle (MARV) and antiradiation homer (ARH) threats. The MARV document has been completed and distrib› uted; the  ARH document has been delayed pending definition of LoAD program changes. The STPO Threat Office, Overlay Demonstration Task  Force,  and ATC personnel  met with sup› porting  contractors  on  2-3  September  1981  and  completed "Threat Parameters for Overlay Ballistic Missile Defense." This document defines the threat parameters for use in analyzing de› fense  concepts considered  in  overlay  BMD.  Comparative BMD capabilities (red-blue) analysis continued to provide Soviet BMD information to support the BMD program manager at congres› sional and related briefings.

The STPO Weapons Office  updated and published a  two› volume document in August 1981 that gave technical information on preferred life cycle hardening design and updated techniques to be avoided.  Warhead lethality analyses were accomplished in support  of the joint  DOD-DOE Phase  2  Warhead  Study  for LoAD initiated  in January  1981;  lethality contours were devel› oped for  combinations of threat models and four different ge› neric defense warhead types. The Attack Working Group of the Weapons Office completed an overlay laydown definition analysis and  published  the  results.  Laydown  analyses  are  currently  in progress with  regard to the new LoAD concept definition.

During fiscal  year 1981, Kwajalein Missile Range (KMR) sup› ported development and operational testing of U.S.  Air Force ICBMs and payloads launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The operational tests comprised various Minuteman  III opera› tional  configurations;  the  development  tests  included  nose  tip evaluations,  various decoy configurations, and maneuvering ve› hicles. The fourth Army designating optical tracker mission was also  launched from KMR. The Army Optical  Station on  Roi› Namur was closed at the end of the fiscal  year.

Most of the modifications to the Army's long-range tracking and instrumentation radar (ALTAIR) to make it a contributing sensor  to  the Air  Force  Space  Detection  and Tracking System (SPADA  TS) were completed during fiscal year 1981. The interim system, which performs satellite catalog maintenance and detects new foreign  launches, became operational.

During fiscal  year 1981, construction began on a millimeter› wave radar, which had been under development since fiscal year 1979.  It will  be an adjunct to the ALCOR C-band radar system and will provide 35 GHz and 95 GHz radar capability along with a  95 GHz radiometer capability.

Participants in  the triservice Strategic Systems Test Support Study (SSTSS) developed  an overall  approach  ensuring nonre› dundant, cost-effective, responsive support for  testing offensive and defensive systems in both the Atlantic and Pacific. They rec› ommended retention of KMR as a  terminal  area  testing asset, but identified a contingency instrumented test area in the Pacific, in  the  event  that the  Kwajalein  atoll  became  unavailable.  The study group assessed the present KMR midatoll corridor bound› aries and  decided  to retain  them.  A  broad ocean area terminal scoring point would be developed north of Roi-Namur for MX testing. A terminal area support aircraft (TASA)-a modified C7  A  Caribou logistics support aircraft-would provide a  surface missile impact location systems (SMILS), terminal telemetry, and optics data collection in lieu of  P-3A/SMILS aircraft. Tugboats at KMR would be used  to place and maintain deep ocean tran› sponders in  the KMR North array. The participants briefed the Deputy Director, Defense Test and Evaluation (DDTE), and the Major Range and Test Facility Committee on 24 July 1981.

## Development

Low-rate initial production of the Ml Abrams tank program continued  during fiscal  year  1981  as  did  development  test  II. Operational test 11 was completed on 29 May  1981. The special meeting  of the  Army  Systems  Acquisition  Review  Council (ASARC) on 17 February 1981 changed the Ml  tank type clas› sification from limited production to standard. Later in fiscal year 1981  the  Army  sought  the  authority  from  OSD  to  enter  full production. From June through August 1981, a group of indus› trial, scientific, and technical leaders convened for the third time to assess  the current status of the tanks' power-train durability. The panel's assessment was  that once corrective action already identified was completed, power-train durability should meet or exceed the Army's  requirements on tanks produced after March 1982. The Army and OSD conducted detailed program reviews on the production status and test results of  the M  1 during August and September 1981.  Based on these reviews,  the OSD author› ized the Army to enter full production. In March, two M  1 tanks were modified to accept the 120-mm. tank gun system, and con› tractor testing was begun. Development of 120-mm. ammw1ition continued. On 15 September 1981, final composition of the first block  improvement  package  was  approved.  Concurrently,  be› cause of technical problems in ammunition development, initial production delivery of the  MlEI  Abrams  tank  (the  120-mm.-

equipped Ml tank) slipped from August 1984 to the last quarter of  fiscal year 1985. Specifications on the Ml  El Abrams tank were expanded to include the Ml tank with block-I  improvements as well as the 120-mm. tank main armament system (XM256).

The  Infantry-Cavalry  Fighting  Vehicles  were  renamed  the Bradley  Fighting Vehicles.  The fiscal  year  1981  program  fully supported the continued development of the logistics,  training, and maintenance support packages of  the two systems. The Army received four production vehicles during fiscal year 1981. Three underwent  testing  by  the  contractor;  the  fourth  was  used  for development and  testing of automated  test  measurements and diagnostic equipment (TMDE).

Development  and  testing  of  the  tube-launched,  optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW) 2  missile system  was  completed in July 1981. The TOW 2 system included an improved missile with a  six-inch  diameter  warhead  and  improvements  to  the  missile guidance systems.  Following development and operational tests, a  review  was  conducted  at  Headquarters,  Department  of the Army, with  the result that the TOW 2  system was classified as standard type, and full  production was authorized.

Engineering and testing of modifications  for  the  improved TOW vehicle (ITV) to fire TOW 2 missiles at full  effectiveness were  completed during fiscal  year  1981.  The  modification  has been  approved for production and application to the entire TOW vehicle fleet.

The  goal  of  the  infantry  man-portable  antiarmor  assault weapon system (IMAAWS) program is to produce a lightweight, high  performance,  man-portable  replacement  for  the  Dragon missile  system.  The IMAAWS  is  also  intended  to  be  the  U.S. component of a  cooperative  development  program with  three other NA  TO partners to replace current antiarmor weapons. In September  1980  contracts  were  awarded  to  Honeywell  and McDonnell  Douglas to design,  build,  and  deliver a  number  of advance-development  prototype  systems  to  be  tested  with  ele› ments of  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's  Tank Breaker program.

One month later the Army canceled the contracts because of concern over the  weight and  bulk of the  proposed systems. A study was  undertaken to review IMAAWS requirements and to revise  its  description as appropriate.  Completed in  April  1981, the study results were inconclusive and led to the withdrawal of funds  for critical  technology development as  well  as  the reallo› cation  of IMAAWS  program  funds  in  the  outyears  to  other higher-priority programs,  and  adversely affected  the  Tank

Breaker program. During the summer, Congress denied funding requested for IMAAWS in fiscal year 1982. At the Army Senior National Representatives (SNR) meeting in  September 1981  at Fort  McNair,  Washington,  D.C.,  the  European  partners  in  the cooperative  development  program  for  antiarmor  weapons  ex› pressed concern over the continued delay in the U.S. part of the program.

Development of the squad automatic weapon (SAW)  system continued during fiscal  year  1981.  Modifications to  the system were assessed, and performance with improved ammunition was evaluated. The Fabrique National (FN) XM249 weapon was mod› ified to incorporate the changes recommended during the selec› tion process. Testing of the improved weapon (XM249El) and ammunition (XM855 and XM856) began in June  1981  at Ab› erdeen  Proving  Ground.  Initial  test  data  confirmed  that  the weapon system will meet or exceed user requirements. Also dur› ing fiscal year 1981, the integrated logistics support package was refined;  additional  work  was  accomplished  on  the final  license agreement, which was submitted to the contractor for final sig› nature; and preliminary work was done to prepare the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant for production.

A  highly successful competition for  the division  air defense (DIVAD)  gun  contract  between  Ford  Aerospace  and  Commu› nications Corporation and General  Dynamics was concluded in May  1981. The Army awarded a contract to construct facilities with three follow-up production options to Ford Aerospace. The corporation began construction of  a new facility for DIV  AD gun production and worked on final  production design.

The Army awarded an advanced development and low-rate production  contract  for  the  multiple  launch  rocket  system (MLRS) to the Vought Corporation in October 1980. Maturation phase development,  improved  warhead,  and  practice  warhead design flight tests of  the basic system were conducted during fiscal year 1981. Program funding was increased by the fiscal year 1981 supplemental and fiscal year 1982 amendment to the President's budget. The International Association of Machinists and Aero› space Workers went on strike against FMC, maker of the MLRS carrier vehicle,  on  4  April  1981.  The strike  was.settled  on  17 June, and work resumed on 22 June 1981. The FMC strike re› sulted in a  four-month slip in MLRS program schedules as  well as a cost increase in both development and procurement funding requirements.

The Pershing II weapon system continued in engineering de› velopment during fiscal year 1981. Two major technical problems

arose, one in the magnetron and the other in the thrust reversal system, and were solved. The proposed fiscal year 1982 Pershing II production  buy,  including a  fiscal  year  1983  option,  was  re› ceived from  Martin  Marietta. The proposed price exceeded the fiscal  year  1982  funding  allocated  for  the  Martin  contract.  At the close  of fiscal  year  1981,  intensive  effort and analysis  were under way to evaluate fully  the contractor's proposal.

The Army's advanced attack helicopter (AAH) program en› tered the final stages of development in  fiscal  year  1981.  In an› ticipation  of future  fielding,  the  Army  approved  the  name  of Apache  for  the  AAH.  The  Army  conducted a  comprehensive operational  test (OT II)  in June-August  1981  at  Fort Hunter› Liggett, California. Results indicated that the AH-64 was ready for production. Contracts were awarded to Hughes Helicopters, Martin  Marietta, and General  Electric  for  procuring hardware items with  long lead-times.

In fiscal  year 1981  full-scale engineering development began of  an infrared capability for the Cobra sight. This innovation will enable  the  gunner  to  detect and engage  targets  at  night and during periods of poor visibility.

Production of the  UH-60A Black  Hawk  continued during fiscal  year  1981  with  105  aircraft delivered  to  the  Army.  The fifth-year production contract for 80 helicopters was awarded to Sikorsky Aircraft Division, United Technologies Corporation, in May 1981. Production of T700 GE-700 engines also continued. On 2 February, General Electric Company received a firm fixed› price contract for  204 engines.  The Black Hawk program was selected  as  the  Army's prime  candidate for  multiyear procure› ment in fiscal  year 1982. The required documentation was  pre› pared and submitted to OSD.

The CH-47 modernization program continued on schedule. Following the contract award to the Boeing Vertol Company in late  October  1980, conversion on  nine CH-47A helicopters to the much improved CH-4  7D model was begun. Two of  the three prototypes were  returned  to  the  manufacturer  for  use as  pro› duction  mock-ups and as  guides for  writing technical  manuals. The third prototype  underwent extended maintenance testing, and no significant problems were found.

The request for proposal (RFP) for the near-term scout hel› icopter (NTSH) of the Army helicopter improvement program (AHIP) was  formulated,  circulated for comment, evaluated,  re› viewed,  and  finally  released  to  industry  in January  1981.  The Army convened a  source selection  evaluation  board (SSEB)  to consider the two responses from industry-from Bell Helicopter

Textron and from  Hughes  Helicopter,  Inc.  On  21  September 1981  the Army announced the award of a full-scale engineering development  (FSED)  contract  for  the  AHIP's near-term  scout helicopter to Bell  Helicopter Textron.

Engineering development of the Hellfire modular missile sys› tem continued through fiscal year 1981, with contracts for items with long lead-times awarded during August 1981 in preparation for fiscal year 1982 production. Hellfire underwent 19 firings in the developmental test (DT) program, 27 firings in the AAH DT program, 4 firings in the Marine Corps laser designator opera› tional test (OT),  12  AAH OT firings,  and 33  missile firings  in Hellfire OT. During the year, 42 missiles were produced under the  engineering  development  contract.  In  preparation  for ASARC-DSARC III, cost reduction efforts were investigated and required documentation was gathered in the Army and OSD.

The Defense  System  Acquisition  Review  council  (DSARC) authorized Patriot to begin limited production in August 1980. The Secretary of Defense decision memorandum (SDDM) from the DSARC specified a  series of verification  tests  to show  that deficiencies had been corrected. The primary effort during fiscal year  1981  was conducting the first three of four unit tests spec› ified by  the SDDM.  In each case  the results  indicated that the specified criteria had been achieved, and authorization was given for the Army to proceed with the agreed test programs. During the fiscal  year  1982 budget process,  the Army requested funds to allow  a  limited  increase in Patriot production.  Based on the testing success,  Congress approved the request.

Contracts for the U.S. Roland air defense missile system were awarded  to Hughes and  Boeing on  10 December  1980  for  17 fire  units  and  400  missiles,  with  associated  support equipment and spares. The Roland reliability evaluation test was successfully completed on  15  December  1980,  and  special  evaluation  tests were  also  successfully  carried  out  at  the  White  Sands  Missile Range on 30 March 1981. A test and evaluation review was held on  8  May  1981  on  the  results  of the  meeting of the  Defense Systems Acquisition  Review  Council  (DSARC)  III  held in May 1979. Favorable test results and successful completion of  all OSD action items resulting from the May  1979 DSARC III indicated that no technical or test issues remained. The first four produc› tion missiles were delivered to the government on 26 June 1981. The first Roland production fire unit was completed on 30 Sep› tember  1981.  Hughes  was  awarded a  contract for  the  Roland trainer on 24 March  1981.

The Stinger passive optical seeker technique (POST) contin-

ued in engineering development during the  year.  POST  con› tractor  flight  testing  began  in January  1981.  Five  flights  were made during the year with the remainder scheduled for comple› tion  by  early  1982. The development schedule was extended to sixty-three months because of  difficulties in integrating and test› ing the sealed head and guidance electronics and in  solving sev› eral  anomalies  detected  during  flight  testing.  These  technical difficulties were successfully overcome.

During fiscal year 1981 USAREUR and FORSCOM reached agreement on  the  !Hawk enhancement  life  cycle  program (HELP). The Department of the Army approved the program, which will recycle missiles through the factory for reliability res› toration  and  for  the  application  of missile  electronic  counter› countermeasure (ECM) improvements. Restoration began in Sep› tember  1981.  As  a  result  of the  air  defense  systems  program review in February 1981, U.S. Army Missile Command (MICOM) took the lead in promoting logistical and technical support to the U.S. Marine Corps and to international users of  the !Hawk system and  formed  a  study  group  to  develop  a  proposed  long-range support plan.

Chaparral is  the Army's short-range air defense (SHORAD) surface-to-air missile system.  The major development effort for the Chaparral's  forward-looking infrared (FLIR) night sight was completed in  1981.  The effort culminated  in  the  users  opera› tional  test at White  Sands  Missile  Range  beginning in August. FLIR will  help  the Chaparral  gunner to find  his  target during the day, at night, and in severe weather, whereas the Chaparral is  currently limited to fair weather, daylight operation.

Viper antiarmor rocket development was completed during fiscal  year 1981. The Viper tactical rocket and the tracer bullet trainer were type-classified as standard in August 1981, following a  DARCOM in-process review and a decision by the VCSA. Op› erational test II was  successfully completed in July 1981.  As the fiscal  year drew to a close,  the Army was  seeking congressional approval to produce Viper.

The year began with a continuation of the shakedown of the Copperhead initial production facility (IPF) and negotiations for the second-year production contract with  Martin Marietta Cor› poration, the system developer. The IPF was completed in April 1981  and thirty-seven rounds were delivered for testing. As the year closed,  production  of related  hardware  items  began,  and major initiatives  to reduce  unit costs and to enhance reliability got under way.

Development of binary retaliatory weapons resumed in fiscal

year 1981. Binary munitions provide significant advantages over existing chemical munitions in terms of manufacturing, storage, transportation, and disposal.  Research  is  under way  on demili› tarization of present stocks and on a  binary modernization pro› gram  to  correct  stockpile  deficiencies  of agent  mix  and ammunition  type.  Advanced development  on  the  binary inter› mediate volatility agent (IVA)  warhead for the multiple  launch rocket system (MLRS) was also resumed. In addition, the eight› inch IVA binary projectile began advanced development after a decision was made to redirect the effort from an eight-inch VX2  projectile  to  the  more  promising  IVA  concept.  Congress ap› propriated $23 million to start construction and to provide initial equipment for an integrated binary munition production facility. Construction on the facility at Pine Bluff,  Arkansas, was sched› uled to begin in October 1981. Development continued on a new protective  mask  and  on  numerous biological  and chemical  de› tection and warning systems, items of  collective protective equip› ment for shelters, vans and tactical armored vehicles, as  well  as decontamination systems for clothing and a  rapid decontamina› tion system for armored vehicles.

The family  of scatterable mines  includes  four  separate  sys› tems: (1) the 155-mm. artillery-delivered antipersonnel, area-den› ial  artillery  munition (ADAM) and  the remote antiarmor mine (RAAM); (2)  the  ground-emplaced  mine  scattering  system (GEMSS); (3) the modular pack mine system (MOPMS); and (4) the Gator scatterable mine system, a joint service venture funded and managed by the Air Force and developed by the Army. De› velopment of  all four systems continued on schedule in fiscal year 1981 . ADAM and RAAM, in low-rate production, were approved for full-scale production by the validation in-process review.  Un› der GEMSS, first-year production of  the M128 ground dispenser and the M75 antitank mine continued, and the M74 antiperson› nel  mine  entered first-year  production.  MOPMS  continued  in engineering development, overcoming some technical problems with the electronic components. Final Gator engineering devel› opment remained on schedule with the delivery of operational test hardware to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S.  Navy.

Army  efforts  to  broaden  the  high-energy  laser  technology base continued in the areas of laser energy devices, fire control and acquisition,  optics,  beam control and propagation, damage and vulnerability, and advanced directed-energy technology. The Army initiated two programs to provide an early demonstration of the  system's capability  upon  which  to  base  future  decisions concerning  laser  weapon  systems.  The  draft  proposal  for  the

I

demonstrator of the forward area laser weapon was released for comment  to  industry  and  to  government  agencies  in January 1981. Contracts were awarded to Hughes Aircraft Company and TRW for competitive preliminary designs on 31 July 1981. Tech› nical requirement reviews for these preliminary designs were held during  August  1981.  The  Roadrunner draft  proposal  was  re› leased for comment to industry and government agencies in April 1981, and the source selection evaluation board  met on 21  Sep› tember 1981.

The second production contract for the ground laser locator designator (GLLD) was  let on 30 October 1980. This procure› ment calls for production of eighty units,  using fiscal  year 1980 funding.  An  option  for  follow-up  production  of an  additional ninety units, under the fiscal year 1981 appropriation, was signed on 4 December 1980. Delivery and testing of the units procured under fiscal  year  1979 appropriations began  during fiscal  year 1981.

Production continued on the AN  /TAS-4 (TOW), AN  /T  AS5 (Dragon), and the AN/TAS-6 (night observation device, long range).  New  production  contracts  were  awarded  to  Texas  In› struments Inc. and to Kollman Instruments Corp. to maintain a competitive base for future contracts. Contracts were also let for production  of supporting  equipment.  A  memorandum  of un› derstanding among three NA  TO nations for the sale and coop› erative  production  of infrared common  modules  was  nearing completion and should be signed soon.

Production continued on second-generation image-intensifi› cation night sights-the AN  /PVS-4 (individual-served  weapon sight), the  AN/TVS-5  (crew-served  weapon  sight),  and  the AN/PVS-5 (night vision goggles). Work continued on third-gen› eration image-intensification  devices.  The aviators  night-vision imaging system (AN/AVS-6) was moving forward in engineering development,  while  the  night vision  goggles  for ground troops completed advanced development.

An intense effort to identify cost alternatives for  the stand› off target acquisition  system  (SOTAS),  to  be  reviewed  by  the Army Systems Acquisition Review Committee (ASARC) and the Defense  Systems  Acquisition  Review  Council  (DSARC),  took place  between  November  1980 and April  1981.  The objective was  to correct the original  underestimate of development time and effort and to set new and realistic program objectives  The ASARC review was  held on  17  April  1981,  and the review  by the DSARC on 21  May  1981. A special task force of the Defense Science Board, meeting on 12 and 13 June 1981, concluded that

SOT  AS was needed and was technically feasible. In late  July OSD directed the Army to conduct a sixty-day review to find further program options for  reducing acquisition costs.  The review in› dicated that reducing the number of  airborne systems to be pro› cured  from  eighty-two  to  sixty-one  and  simplifying  the  radar would save approximately 24 percent in acquisition.  It was also proposed that significant portions of  the remaining development be put on a  fixed-price basis.  When negotiations with Motorola, the  prime contractor,  failed  to produce agreement on a  fixed› price contract,  the  Army proposed that radar development be resolicited. The matter had not been resolved by the end of the fiscal  year.

Development continued on the improved  155-mm. nuclear projectile. A significant technological breakthrough was achieved in  bonding the  rotating  band  to  a  thin-shell  titanium  body.  A program was instituted to test the projectile in NATO howitzers and to develop firing tables. Planned procurement was increased to  meet the minimum Army requirement.  Capitalization funds supporting the 155-mm. development were cut because Congress was skeptical about the need to have modern nuclear projectiles for both the 8-inch and 155-mm. howitzer systems. Options aimed at reducing the impact of the budget cut were being reviewed as the fiscal  year ended.

On  7  July  1981,  development  contracts  amounting  to  ap› proximately $4 million each were awarded to AM General Cor› pora  ti  on,  Chrysler  Defense  Incorporated,  and  Teledyne Continental Motors for development by each of  eleven high-mo› bility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) prototypes. The HMMWV will replace the M561 Gama Goat and the M274 Mule and will  selectively replace  M  151  quarter-ton  utility  vehicles  in tactically  demanding environments such as TOW weapons ear› ner.

## Rationalization, Standardization, and Interoperability (RSI)

Over the past year the  RSI  program  has expanded  to em› phasize training and to implement the NATO Mutual Support Act of 1979 (PL 96-323). Emphasis has continued on strength› ening the NATO long-term defense program (LTDP).

Two significant events took place during the year concerning NATO's international  cooperative  research  and  development. The first  was  the  Four Power Senior National  Representatives (SNR) meeting on  16-18 September 1981  in Washington,  D.C.

The other was the election for  the first  time of a  U.S.  general officer to chair the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG).

The September 1981 SNR meeting, the eighth in a series that began in fiscal year 1977, approved the release of  threat data on Soviet tank and antiarmor weapons jointly developed by the four powers as well as the release of  additional information about the Soviet threat that the United States,  United Kingdom,  France, and  the  Federal  Republic of Germany intend  using to support future antiarmor weapons development. The data will be dissem› inated  to  other  NATO countries as  well.  In addition  the  four powers signed a  memorandum of understanding in April  1981, providing for reciprocity of  information on improvements in the current generation of  antitank guided weapons.  For the United States, this involved an exchange of  data on improvement of the TOW and Dragon antitank missiles. The Europeans are to pro› vide  information  on  the improvement of the  HOT (Haut Sub› sonique Optiquement Teleguide tire d'un  Tube) and the MILAN (Missile d'Infanterie Leger Antichar).

The United States in June 1981 said that it would nominate someone for the election of  a new chairman of the NATO Army Armaments  Group  (NAAG).  Subsequently,  at its  thirty-eighth meeting,  the NAAG elected a  U.S.  general officer,  the Deputy Director of  the Weapons Systems Directorate, ODCSRDA, to the post.  His term will  expire in  fiscal  year 1983.

The U.S.  Army also  carried on  staff talks  with the military representatives of  the Federal Republic of  Germany, France, and the United Kingdom with primary emphasis on the development of combat doctrine and materiel requirements. An ad hoc com› mittee began a NATO ammunition interagency review under the auspices of  the NATO Army Board. In March 1981 all members of NATO endorsed this effort. Conversion of  jet fuels from JP4  to  JP-8 within  NATO was still  being considered by the fuels working group of the Ad Hoc Committee on Equipment Inter› operability. Cost and availability remained the main obstacles to full-scale  conversion. The Army continued to participate in  the American,  British, Canadian, and Australian (ABCA) standard› ization  program and  was  the  host for  the  first  meeting of the ABCA working group on collaborative training in April at Or› lando, Florida.  The Army also sent a  delegation  headed by the Vice Chief of Staff to the twenty-third meeting of the high-level ABCA conference known as TEAL, held in Montreal, Canada, in  October.  The conferees  discussed  means to  extend and  im› prove ABCA standardization efforts for fiscal  years  1982-1983.

In other RSI developments, the  Joint Roland Committee held

a  special  meeting  in  Paris,  France,  on  20-21  November  1980. Trinational agreement (U.S., French, and German) was reached on potential  system  modifications  to be investigated for  incor› poration into the Roland weapon system to counter the post-1985 threat.  In  1981  Germany joined with  six  other NATO nations (Belgium,  Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Turkey, and Italy) and formed a  project group  to  study alternative  forms  of ac› quiring Stinger by a  multinational consortium. A memorandum of  understanding for NATO coproduction was submitted to OSD for  staffing  in July  1981.  Foreign  country  interest  in  the  Im› proved Hawk (!Hawk) continued in fiscal year 1981. After a two› year hiatus clearance was obtained for travel to Taiwan, and two trips were made this year which significantly improved commu› nications and progress of the Taiwan program. A letter of  agree› ment  was  forwarded  to  the  Arab  Republic  of Egypt  at  their request. The Egypt Improved Hawk program is  proceeding on schedule.  In October  1980 a  contract was  signed with  Maschi› nenfabrik Augsburg Nurnberg for fifteen vehicles for Pershing II (PII) and the ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with an option for additional vehicles to support PII and GLCM fielding.

## 12.  Security Assistance

Security  assistance  programs  are  the  means  by  which  the United States government seeks to achieve national security and foreign policy objectives by enabling allied and friendly nations to acquire and maintain the capability to defend themselves. Dur› ing fiscal  year 1981, Army security assistance programs fell  into four categories:  Military Assistance  Programs (MAPs),  Interna› tional Military Education and Training Programs (IMETPs), For› eign  Military  Sales  Financing  Programs,  and  Foreign  Military Sales (FMS) programs. Eighty-three countries and international organizations, such as NATO, participated in at least one of  these four programs during the year. The programs provided defense equipment, services, and training to foreign countries under the authority provided by the  International  Security and Develop› ment  Act  of 1980  (PL  96-533),  which  amended  the  Foreign Assistance Act of 1961  and the Arms Export Control Act.

In all four programs, six countries accounted for 75 percent of  the open case value. Four of  the six were located in the Middle East.  The table below  lists  them and the value of their cases as of 28 September 1981.

| Countries                       | Value (in billions of dollars)   |

Grant aid under the Military Assistance Program has declined steadily since fiscal year 1977. In 1981  Congress authorized MAP programs  for  four  countries:  Portugal,  Spain,  Sudan,  and  the Philippines.  The  following  table  provides  comparative data on MAP for the past three fiscal  years:

Foreign governments find some pieces of American military equipment more useful  than others.  The table  below  lists  the most popular items in demand by FMS and grand-aid customers. "Delivered" means actually shipped; "programmed" means that the  Department  of the  Army  had  a  firm  commitment;  and ''planned''  eans that the Department of  the Army has tendered m or  a foreign government has requested a letter of  offer and agree› ment (LOA) or that a  foreign  government has requested price and availability or planning and review data. All  the figures are as of 28 September 1981.

The International Military Education and Training Program provided instruction to military and related civilian personnel of friendly countries. During fiscal year 1981 the program consisted of $13.8 million for fifty-six  countries.

Eligible  foreign  governments  make  Foreign  Military  Sales purchases of  defense articles, services, and training from the U.S. government. The total FMS program (open cases) amounted to $40.8 billion at the end of  the fiscal year. The Army had delivered $19.2 billion worth of  equipment and services as of  30 September 1981, leaving $21.7 billion yet to be delivered. The Foreign Mil› itary Sales  Financing Program  provided  credit and loan  repay› ment  guarantees.  FMS  financing  was  provided  to  thirty-two countries during fiscal  year 1981. The program involved a total of $3.1  billion, with  $1 .4 billion allocated to Israel.

## Administration and Management

Because of the sensitivity and importance of issues involved, the President  often makes decisions in the security assistance area. The Secretary of State provides continuous supervision and di› rection  of the  Military  Assistance  Programs,  the  International Military  Education  and  Training  Programs,  and  sales  and  ex› ports, including Foreign Military Sales and Grant-Aid Programs, in order to ensure that they are integrated with other aspects of U.S.  foreign policy.  The Secretary of Defense has the responsi› bility of  determining the military equipment that  a country needs, procuring it, supervising the training of foreign  military and ci› vilian personnel  needed to operate and maintain  it,  and super-

vising  its  transportation  and  delivery.  As  a  consequence,  the secretary must also set priorities for  procuring, delivering, and allocating military equipment.

Acting under the policy guidance of the Secretary of  Defense and the oversight of the Secretary of the Army, the Undersec› retary of the Army develops doctrine,  negotiates and prepares procedures to implement international agreements, and carries out approved and funded foreign security assistance programs. Other key civilians in the process include the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition, who implements security  assistance  at  the  secretariat  level,  and  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Installations, Logistics, and Financial Management, who reviews and resolves customer prob› lems in all phases of  supply and financial management. The Vice Chief of  Staff of the Army also plays an important role.  He acts as cochairrnan with  the Undersecretary of the Army on the Se› curity Assistance Steering Group,  which serves as  the advisory body for the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of  Staff on all security assistance  matters.  The steering group assesses and in› terprets security assistance policy originating in OSD and other federal  agencies  and  provides  guidance  to  the  Army  staff for developing Army security assistance policy, plans, and programs. The steering group also  allows  top-level  exchanges concerning ongoing and anticipated security assistance actions and provides oversight on Foreign Military Sales transactions.  It reviews and recommends Army policy on all security assistance matters that affect the Army and recommends Army positions for the Army Export Control Board. The members of the steering group, ex› cept for  the  cochairmen,  consist  of deputy  chiefs  of staff,  the commanding generals of DARCOM and TRADOC, and other high-ranking officers. The steering group receives staff support from the Army Security Assistance Coordinating Group, which is chaired  by  the  Assistant  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Logistics (Security Assistance) (ADCSLOG(SA]), and consists of represen› tatives from  the Army staff and the major commands. The co› ordinating group also ensures that there is cooperation between the various staff  agencies on certain security assistance cases. This detailed oversight of cases  in  preparation stands in  contrast  to the function of the steering group, which serves as a mechanism for final  review.

Security assistance involves a large number of  staff  functions. Consequently, the steering group and the coordinating group are both very large and somewhat  unwieldy  when all  members are present.  Without cataloging  all  the agencies  involved,  two  ex-

amples  will  convey  the  complexity  involved.  The  Comptroller General, who is  a  full-time  member of the steering group, pro› vides  overall supervision for "the budgeting, accounting, fund› ing,  and  financial  management  for  security  assistance."  The Surgeon General, on the other hand, only attends when the sub› ject under discussion  touches on  medical  matters.  He exercises overall supervision, direction, and control on the Army staff  con› cerning the provision of ''medical  materiel, training, and related services" to foreign governments. Three offices, because of their importance in the process, deserve more discussion: Office of  the Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Logistics  (DCSLOG),  Office  of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS), and the Office of the Chief of Engineers (OCE).

The DCSLOG acts  in  security  assistance  matters  primarily through the ADCSLOG(SA),  who  is  aided  by  the Security  As› sistance Policy Coordinating Office (SAPCO). The Assistant Dep› uty  Chief of Staff coordinates  the  development  of all  Army policies related to security assistance,  including the preparation of  Army regulations affecting the field. He provides guidance on policy to the commanding general of DARCOM, who is the ex› ecutive agent for the Army in all security assistance matters. Act› ing in behalf  of  the Chief  of  Staff, the ADCSLOG issues directives to  all  major commands on the subject.  He also  acts as  the ap› propriation director for  the Foreign  Military Sales  budget and as the budget program director for supply operations of  the Mil› itary Assistance Program. SAPCO is the primary Army staff  ele› ment  for  coordinating  the  development  of security  assistance policy.  It keeps the ADCSLOG(SA) and other key staff members informed of major security assistance issues and coordinates pol› icy  on processing export licenses for  munitions and  technology referred to the Secretary of the Army for decision.

The DCSOPS acts as the main point of contact on the Army staff for joint strategic objectives  plans and  force  development for friendly and allied forces.  His office assesses the political and military aspects of proposed security assistance projects and de› termines the  Army's position regarding what level  of readiness and what configuration a  foreign  army should  seek  in light of U.S.  contingency  plans.  The DCSOPS  informs  the Joint Staff about  the  levels  of support-both  equipment  and  training› which a  foreign army requires, and recommends what priorities should be assigned to each army. Within ODCSOPS, the Security Assistance Division of the Strategy, Plans, and Policy Directorate contains  area  desk  officers  who  review  specific  programs  and cases, analyzing them from  the standpoint of Army policy.  The

division  may propose changes in  legislation,  Department of De› fense policy, or State Department policy to bring them more in line with national objectives and with realities in the local coun› tries.

The Chief  of  Engineers is in the same position as the Surgeon General;  he attends meetings of the steering group only when the questions under discussion affect his areas of responsibility. The Chief of Engineers acts as the principal adviser and agent for design and construction of facilities  in foreign security assis› t~nce ~rograms and coordinates all activities associated with en› gmeermg.

When a  foreign  government  wants  military  assistance,  the procedures followed are similar whether the request is for equip› ment, training, or construction. Frequently, the foreign govern› ment applies  for  security  assistance  at  the  American  embassy. After review and approval  by  the Department of State, the re› quest goes to the Department of Defense. If design or construc› tion of  a  facility is involved, OSD refers it to the Secretary of  the Army,  who sends it,  after appropriate staffing,  to the  Chief of Engineers for study.  The Corps of Engineers prepares a  docu› ment, technically referred to as a case, that describes the services the Corps is  requested to provide,  the sources of funding,  and the payment schedule. The Corps sends the case to the Secretary of  the Army, who, after a review by the interested staff agencies, forwards it to OSD for decision.

## Policy

During fiscal  year  1981  the  Army  staff participated  in the development and review  of proposals for inclusion  in the fiscal year 1982 legislation authorizing security assistance-the Inter› national  Security  and  Development  Cooperation  Act  of 1981. Policy issues supported by the Army included lifting restrictions on assistance to selected countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southwest Asia; establishing a Special Defense Acquisition Fund for advance procurement of military materiel for sale to foreign countries; and setting higher dollar thresholds for congressional review of  Foreign Military Sales cases. The Army made a proposal to give the same concessionary sales terms and conditions to the Republic of Korea that Congress authorized in 1981  for NATO, Japan,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand.  The  Army  also  recom› mended establishing assistance training programs.

Congressional  reaction  in  favor  of the  Special  Defense  Ac› quisition  Fund became evident soon after the  Reagan  adminis-

tration presented its legislative proposals. Congress had rejected similar proposals on two previous occasions even though the idea had  received  favorable  reports  from  the  armed  services  com› mittees.  Since  1974  the  Army  had urged that the Department of Defense include such proposals in security assistance  legisla› tion,  which  was addressed  by  the Senate Foreign Relations and the House Foreign  Affairs  Committees,  rather than  in  the de› fense legislation, which was addressed by the armed services com› mittees.  During  1981,  this  approach  seemed  to  be  successful, although  Congress had not completed final  passage of the leg› islation by the end of the fiscal year.  If  created, the fund should have  a  positive  impact on  the  readiness  of the  Army.  The De› partment of Defense  could  use  the  military  materiel  procured with fund dollars to fulfill  urgent or emergency foreign require› ments, thus avoiding diversions or withdrawals of Army materiel.

During 1981, the Army participated in  the development of the  new  administration's conventional  arms  transfer policy  ap› proved by President Reagan on 8 July 1981. This policy, drafted by  the State  Department,  received several  reviews  by  the Joint Chiefs  of Staff with  assistance  from  the  military  services.  The philosophy underlying the new policy was that arms transfers are an essential element of U.S. defense posture and foreign policy. The new program took a  more practical  approach  toward  au› thorizing,  managing,  and controlling arms  transfers to foreign countries. It  allowed, for example, security assistance teams over› seas to do force planning with  the host governments, an activity not heretofore permitted.  Until enactment of the International Security  and  Development Cooperation  Act  of 1980,  the  De› partment of Defense  handled  requests  for  assistance  involving construction and those involving equipment as part of the same program.  The new  law  separated  the construction effort from normal Foreign Military Sales to cover the design, construction, operation,  and  maintenance  of real  prop'erty facilities.  It  also raised  the  dollar  level  of Foreign  Military  Construction  Sales (FMCS) that require congressional  review  from  $25 million  to $200 million.

## Foreign Military Training

Training for  foreign  military students  is  funded  from  both the International Military Education Training Program and For› eign  Military Sales.  Over 6,000 of these students have received military  training in  the  continental  United  States and  overseas under  U.S.  Army sponsorship.  The IMETP  provided  over $7

million;  FMS  training exceeded $27 million.  The Fellows  Pro› gram at the Army  War College is  the most prestigious training available  under Army auspices for foreign  students. Established by the Chief of Staff, General Bernard Rogers, in August 1977, its  objective is  to create and  maintain special  relationships with officers from military organizations of  selected foreign countries. During the 1981-1982 academic year, students participated from Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Japan,  Jor› dan, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sen› egal,  Sudan, Sweden, Thailand, and Yugoslavia.  Over a  period of years the Army attempts to give as many countries as possible the opportunity to take part in  the program.

The Army formally opened the NATO Nike Training Center (NNTC) on 29 September 1980 at Fort Bliss, Texas. It operates independently  as  a  separate  NATO  Maintenance  and  Supply Agency (NAMSA) facility and provides maintenance training to NATO countries  on the European configuration of the  Nike› Hercules  missile  system.  Belgium,  Germany,  Greece,  Italy,  the Netherlands, and Turkey decided to improve the Nike system at the same time that the U.S. Army decided to phase it out. These events created the need for the center. Until then the Army had provided Nike maintenance training for the NATO allies.  Two hundred and eighteen students attended during fiscal year 1981, and Fort Bliss provided administrative and logistical support val› ued at $2.3 million.  FMS reimbursed these overhead expenses.

## NATO and Europe

NATO interest in  security assistance  was  high in  fiscal  year 1981  as  efforts continued to  improve combat effectiveness sig› nificantly through the modernization of armaments.  Fiscal  year 1980 momentum continued because the alliance recognized that the Soviets were continuing to build toward military superiority and  perceived  that  the  impressive  modernization  programs  al› ready carried out by the Warsaw Pact had resulted in a  relative diminution of NATO's strength. At the end of the year NATO could look forward to some reinforcement as Spain prepared to join the alliance.

The U.S. commitment to weapon standardization and inter› operability, along with  increased host nation support, remained firm  during  1981.  Foreign  Military Sales during the year were Jess significant than American cooperative initiatives and efforts for future arms development and production in  three areas: (1) reciprocal procurement agreements among NATO countries to

make the total NATO defense market available to the defense industries of all alliance partners; (2) plans for coproduction of armaments as development is completed so that the weapon sys› tems of  one NATO country are available to other NATO forces at a  low  unit cost; and (3)  "family of weapons" agreements for new development projects,  so  that new weapons systems incor› porate modern technology  from  the  NATO countries  without duplicating research and development costs.

By  the end of the year,  the  Army staff had  identified four major trends regarding security assistance in the NATO region. First, allied efforts to assist  NATO's  two poorest members, Por› tugal and Turkey, had not produced the extensive modernization programs necessary.  In the future  the organization would  have to  increase  its  efforts  to  strengthen  and  modernize  NATO's southern flank.  Second,  the Army would need  to study  future coproduction agreements very carefully with regard to their im› pact upon the U.S. production base and the accompanying release of sensitive  defense technology.  Third,  the  U.S.  and  the other member nations would continue to solicit their allies to purchase certain  weapons  in  order  to  generate  enough orders  to  keep production lines "warm" and, in some cases, to expand the pro› duction base.  Long production lead-times frustrate  moderniza› tion efforts even when funds become available.  Finally, the basis for  security  assistance  to  some NATO allies  required shifting from  perceived  relative  formulas  to  recognized  requirements. Negotiations throughout fiscal year 1981 moved in this direction by  consistently  pressing for  "best  effort"  pledges  rather  than specific items of  equipment or specific percentage formulas based on aid received by other nations.

Three European countries-Turkey, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and Switzerland-participated in  the Foreign Military Sales program to a significant extent during 1981. Tur› key  ordered, at a  cost of $130 million,  348 kits  for  upgrading M48Al tanks to the M48A5 configuration. Turkey planned to convert a total of918 M48Al tanks to M48A5s. By 30 September 1981  Turkey had shown an interest in manufacturing many of the  items  needed  for  modernization.  Additionally during Sep› tember,  planning  began  on  forming  a  combined  U.S.-Turkey Tank Modernization Office in Turkey sometime during calendar year 1982 to oversee the entire program. During 1981  the Fed› eral Republic of  Germany accepted a new Foreign Military Sales case  for  a  two-week  training course on  the  use  of a  computer program to determine the effects of explosives on targets. The Corps of Engineers' Waterways  Experiment Station  scheduled

the course for presentation early in the first quarter of  fiscal year 1982.  In  another Foreign  Military Sales case  the  Corps of En› gineers blew  up a section of bridge construction to provide the German Army with information with which to evaluate the effect of  explosives on bridges. Switzerland initiated a test program to select a new main battle tank in 1981. Two tanks, the U.S. MlEl and the West German Leopard II, entered the competition. The Army leased two M  1 tanks to the Swiss for a one-year technical test,  and two more tanks for operational testing.  The Swiss ex› pected to complete their tests in the third quarter of fiscal  year 1982 and make their selection during the fourth  quarter.  The Army staff was  preparing a  memorandum of understanding for Swiss acquisition and coproduction of the M  1  E  1 as the fiscal year ended.

## The Middle East and Africa

Defense Requirements Surveys continued to provide the first step in  initiating or expanding security assistance relations with countries in the Middle East and Africa. These surveys consisted of either an  on-site  study  to  determine  the  requirement  of a foreign  government for  a  particular American weapons system or a wide-ranging study, also on-site, to determine the materiel, organizational,  doctrinal,  and  manpower  needs  of foreign  gov› ernments in light of the threat posed by potential enemies. Dur› ing 1981  the Army conducted surveys in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Sudan. Seven countries in the Middle East qualified during 1981 for either FMS credits, IMET, or Economic Support Funds. These last are monies contributed by  the  U.S.  as either a  grant or a  loan  to  support friendly  governments  which  face particularly  difficult  external  security  threats.  The  funds,  ad› ministered by the  U.S.  State Department,  may  be used only to bolster the local  economy as an  offset to the government's ab› normally large expenditures on defense and may  not be used to purchase defense or defense-related  materiel.  Egypt and Israel received  the  largest  FMS  credits,  while Jordan  was  the  largest IMET client.

The security assistance program for Saudi Arabia continued to be the Army's largest program during fiscal  year 1981. Total program value stood at $22.7  billion.  Construction projects ac› counted for  $18.8  billion;  $1.9  billion  was  for  Saudi  Arabian National Guard (SANG) modernization, and $2 billion for Saudi Arabian Land Forces (SALF) modernization.  At the end of the fiscal  year the Army was  considering plans to expand the Two-

Brigade Mechanization  Program to include two additional  bri› gades. In 1981 the Army and the Saudis drafted a Saudi Arabian Land Forces Aviation Master Plan which called for the procure› ment of 123 helicopters over the next seven years. The estimated cost exceeded $6.5  billion.  The Security Assistance  Division  in the Office of  the Deputy Chief of  Staff for Operations and Plans expected that this program would be accepted and implemented during the first quarter of  calendar year 1982. During 1981 the Saudi Ordnance Corps Program continued to improve the Saudi capability to maintain equipment provided under FMS.

On  24  August  1981  the  United  States  and  Saudi  Arabia signed a six-year memorandum of understanding concerning the development of  a comprehensive health care system for the Saudi Arabian  National  Guard.  Since  September  1979  when  Prince Abdullah  requested assistance  from  several  countries,  the  U.S. has carried on negotiations with the SANG. The prince had asked for  a  complete  health  care system  throughout his  kingdom,  to include construction and operation of  hospitals and clinics, train› ing programs, a logistics system, a field medical service, a medical records system, and a medical evacuation system. A team of  Army Medical Department and Corps of  Engineer personnel developed an  intensive  plan  for  accomplishing  these objectives  in  August 1980. The Army provided the plan to the Saudi National Guard. Further discussions  with  Prince  Abdullah revealed that his  im› mediate interest was to open and have in operation two hospitals already under construction-one in Riyadh and one in Jidda.

Other countries expressed interest in the project and nego› tiated with the Saudi Arabian National Guard at the same time as  the United States. In December 1980 the Saudis agreed that the British should operate the hospital in Jidda. Additionally, the Saudi National Guard and Great Britain entered into a  memo› randum of understanding for development and implementation of  an entire health care system for the Saudi Guard. The follow› ing month the U.S. proposed that the U.S. operate and maintain the Riyadh hospital complex as a 200-bed acute-care facility. The Saudi Guard accepted  the  proposal, and the  U.S.  prepared an appropriate  letter of offer and acceptance.  However, the Saudi Guard wanted a  memorandum of understanding similar to the one with Britain, addressing the entire medical project. Following detailed negotiations, the two countries signed the memorandum of understanding on  24  August  1981.  The dollar estimates for a complete health care system were in the billions. For this reason there was  considerable interest in  and competition among U.S. health care corporations to obtain the contracts let by  the U.S.

government.  For the  same reason  considerable rivalry  had de› veloped between the U.S.  and Great Britain over the award of these contracts.

The Department of State sent the first  letter of offer and acceptance for the operation and maintenance of  the Riyadh hos› pital  complex  to  Congress in  April  1981.  The U.S.  anticipated that the Saudi Arabian National Guard would sign the letter early in the first quarter of fiscal  year 1982. The Army Medical Corps will oversee the letting of  contracts to U.S. health care firms and supervise their fulfillment.

In fiscal  year 1981  the major portion of  support provided by the Corps of  Engineers for foreign countries went to Saudi Ara› bia, as  it had in  past years. The Corps provided design and con› struction support under four programs: the Engineer Assistance Agreement Program, the Saudi Naval  Expansion  Program, the Saudi  National  Guard  Modernization  Program, and  the  Peace Hawk-Peace Sun  Program. In addition, the Corps continued to work with and assist the  Saudi Arabian  Army Ordnance Corps in  managing  a  modern  logistics  system.  During  the  year  con› tractors completed projects let by the Corps of  Engineers valued at  $985.6  million.  The  Corps  awarded  construction  contracts valued at $1.8  billion  as  well  as  design  contracts and contracts for the modification of  designs valued at $35.2 million. The U.S. government  approved  Foreign  Military  Sales  cases,  including amendments and modifications,  totaling  $1.528  billion  for  im› plementation by the Corps and canceled cases worth $1.491 bil› lion.  In addition the Corps prepared master plan estimates and design and construction schedules for army aviation facilities for the Saudis. The construction  program,  which  will  probably fall to the Corps, has an estimated value of $2 billion.

Also in  the Middle East, the Corps provided support for the Israeli-Egyptian  Peace Treaty. The U.S.  }\.ir  Force acted as the Department of Defense project manager and the Corps of En› gineers as the construction agent for the design and construction management of two air bases in the Negev Desert. The Depart› ment of Defense approved the program, which was estimated to cost $1.044 billion based on the amended plan of work. Funding for  the  initial  phases  of the construction  program,  some  $2.58 million, came from the Israeli Foreign Military Construction Sales (FMCS) case. Construction continued throughout fiscal year 1981 at the Ramon and Ovda sites.  In addition to the construction of the  two  Israeli  air  bases,  the  Corps of Engineers  managed  the design and construction of  two base camps in the Sinai to support the Multinational Force and Observers Peacekeeping Operation.

The Corps awarded the first  increment of a  contract on 2 Sep› tem  ber 1981. It expects the completed prngTam to cost from $50 million to $100 million.

During 1981  the Coq.1s continued its involvement in the con› struction  and  installation  of equipment  for  the Jordan  Armor Rebuild Facility QARF). By the end of  the year, construction was 50 percent complete and the rest was scheduled to be  done by January  1983.  The  Corps also  finished  a  management plan  to guide the  Jordanian armed forces in all  actions necessary to start up and  operate the JARF at its rated capacity.  Total case  value as of 30 September 1981  was $16.79 million.

As a result of  the Syrian-Jordanian border crisis in  December 1980, the Army expedited delivery of materiel provided by the Military  Assistance  Program  and  Foreign  Mihtary  Sales  to  the Jordanian Army. Special airlifts delivered  1.13 million rounds of 5.56-mrn. ammunition, 22,600 M67 hand grenades, 500 90-mm. high explosive tank cartridges, 2,000 81-mm. high explosive car› tridges,  323  M60  machine  guns,  and  400 81-mrn.  illuminating cartridges.  Jordan's  largest purchase from the Army during fiscal year  1981  consisted  of twenty-four  AH-lS  Cobra  helicopters, which with support equipment totaled $2.1  bitlion.

During the fiscal year, Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt were the most important FMS  and  !MET customers in  northern Africa, with Egypt receiving the bulk of American  attention.  Egypt in 198  l continued to receive extensive Foreign Military Sales credits to finance security assistance programs begun in fiscal year 1980. The total program through fiscal  year 1983 had a  planned cost of $3.95 billion.  The Army portion of the program was  valued at  $2.3  billion.  The  most  significant  items  were  439  M60A3 tanks,  1,214  Mll3  vehicles,  12  Improved  Hawk  batteries,  and an undisclosed number of I-TOWs. Security assistanct.. provided during 1981 amounted to $900 million, with accelerated delivery of weapons receiving the greatest emphasis. These munitions in› cluded 128 M60A3 tanks,  105-mm. ammunition, M88Al recov› ery  vehicles,  and  associated  spare  parts  and  test  equipment diverted from Army stocks to meet the early delivery dates. The Department of the Army in April 1981  directed the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command to send a fourteen-man mobile training team to Egypt to help the Egyptians incorporate fifteen CH-47 helicopters into their armed forces.  The Egyptians had purchased  the  helicopters  commercially.  In  addilion  to  new equipment, Egypt benefited from twenty-eight Defense Produc› tion  Assistance  Projects,  of which  the  Anny  had  implemented twelve by  30 September 1981. The objective of  these programs

was to strengthen the capabilities of  the Egyptian defense indus› try  as  well  as  the  Egyptian  economy.  Representing  the  Army, Maj.  Gen. Clyde W.  Spence, the Assistant Deputy Chief of  Staff for  Logistics  (Security  Assistance),  conducted the  first  manage› ment review of Egypt's entire program with  his Egyptian coun› terpart in  September  1981. They discussed the  complete program, identified and reconciled differences of  interpretation between the two services, and laid  the groundwork for new in› itiatives.

The Army increased the number of mobile training teams in sub-Sahara Africa in  1981.  A majority of the teams were equip› ment oriented.  However,  nation-building projects,  designed  to improve a  country's technical infrastructure or economy signif› icantly, also increased.

The slumlike conditions in  which ordinary soldiers and their families  lived contributed to the Liberian Army's lack of loyalty to  the Tolbert  regime and  fanned  the  violence  associated  with the coup that brought Master Sergeant Samuel K.  Doe to power in April 1980. During 1981, a mobile training team worked with the Liberian government on housing for its army, while a second team helped  upgrade command and control.  A  technical  assis› tance field team (TAFT) deployed to Nigeria for one year to help the Nigerian Army develop its physical training program.  Also, a defense survey team traveled to Nigeria to study the question of expanding  the  training facilities  of that country's army  into five  new regions.

The U.S. placed increased emphasis on security assistance to Sudan during fiscal  year  1981.  The Army played a  key role in preparing a military options package for the country. As a result the  American and Sudanese armies developed a  ground forces package which consisted of  M60A3 tanks, M88 recovery vehicles, M  114 towed howitzers, heavy equipment transports, ground sur› veillance  radars,  and  Ml25A2  (81-mm.)  mortar  carriers.  The Army staff planned to accelerate delivery of this  equipment to Sudan early in fiscal year 1982 by taking it from U.S. Army assets.

Sudan, Nigeria, and Kenya were the leading Foreign Military Sales  and  International  Military  Education  Training  Program customers south of the Sahara during 1981. The Army staff ex› pected further expansion during fiscal  year  I  982.

## Padflc Region and Asia

Security assistance programs for the Pacific region and Asia during fiscal year 1981  continued to be affected by the instability

in  the Indian Ocean area  which  was  caused by several  factors: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the possibility of further Soviet advances  into  Pakistan  and  Iran;  the  threat  of a  wider conflict in Southeast Asia arising from  the occupation of Kam› puchea by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, coupled with Thai› land's  tacit  allowance  of  anti-Vietnamese  elements  operating from  inside  Thailand;  the  unresolved  internal  problems  in  the Philippines; and the consolidation of power within Korea by the regime of President Chun Doo Hwan.

U.S.  support of military equipment previously furnished  to Taiwan  continued.  The Department of Defense  announced in early January  1980  the sale of new  materiel to  the Taiwanese. Deliveries  began  during  1981.  Army  equipment included  self› propelled  155-mm.  and  8-inch  howitzers,  .50-caliber  machine guns, and !Hawk missiles. Under the 1981 Foreign Military Sales program  for  Taiwan,  forty  Taiwanese  personnel-nineteen of› ficers and twenty-one enlisted men-received U.S. Army train› ing,  most of it of a  technical  nature, in twenty-three courses of instruction.

The United States continued to contribute to South Korean security through the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954, the main› tenance of U.S.  troops in Korea, an extensive Foreign Military Sales program, IMET training, and technical cooperation in the development of selected Korean defense industries. The Carter administration in the fall  of 1977 decided to withdraw all  U.S. forces from Korea over a five-year period. In  July 1979 President Carter decided, on the basis of new intelligence information re› garding troop and equipment levels  in  the north,  to defer any more withdrawals for two years. President Reagan canceled plans to  withdraw  ground combat troops,  although some withdrawal of  ground support personnel and transfer of  key items of  military equipment continued as scheduled. During fiscal year 1981, the Army added ammunition valued at approximately $81 million to U.S.  war reserve stocks in  the Republic of Korea (ROK), which are  designated for  use  by  ROK  ground forces  in  the  event of war.  The Army provided instruction during the same period to eighty ROK personnel-sixty-seven officers and thirteen enlisted men-in various professional development and technical training courses.

Japan continued to acquire military equipment, services, and training of a  defensive nature from  the  United States in  1981. Japan also continued to conduct a  vigorous licensed production program which enhanced its defense posture, expanded that por› tion of  its industrial base  capable of  defense production, increased

its self-sufficiency, and ensured interoperability with U.S. forces. CoproducLion agreements with  the  United States  involved  the production of such systems as  Nike and the !Hawk. Discussions were held concerning coproduction of additional systems  to in› clude TOW, Copperhead,  Stinger,  the  M 11 0A2  howitzer,  and the  AH-lS  helicopter.  During  the  year,  thirty-two  Japanese Ground Self-Defense  Force  personnel  received professional  or technical  training in  the  United States,  and  1,503 officers and men participated in !Hawk and Nike annual service practice at Fort Bliss,  Texas.

The threat of incursions across the Thai-Kampuchea border by forces of  the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam continued to stim› ulate Thai concerns and requests for security assistance.  Air de› fense  and  additional  armor  rated  high  on  the  priority  list  for Thailand. The U.S. and Thai governments initiated bilateral lo› gistical  planning  between  their  respective  services  in  order to provide Thailand with the expertise needed for long-range plan› ning.

The U.S. Army,  Navy, and Air  Force conducted discussions in  Washington with a  Pakistani defense group in mid-July.  The Army targeted its security assistance  efforts on  the deficiencies in  Pakistani defenses and on the obsolescence of existing equip› ment.  The Pakistani were  mainly  concerned with the early de› livery of F-16 aircraft. However, armor, air defense, and other combat capabilities also received considerable attention.  U.S. o› vertures to Pakistan, of  which the Washington Security Assistance Conference  was  only  one  example,  caused  U.S.  relations  with India to cool  during the year.  India did  not use  all  the  IMET funds allocated to it during 1981, and the two governments did not conclude any major Foreign Military Sales arrangements.

## Western Hemisphere

Nineteen  Latin American countries received FMS financing or training under the International Military Education Training Assistance Program. Countries which  in  previous years rejected U.S. security assistance or had their programs terminated by the U.S. government because of human rights issues did not receive funds  during fiscal  year  1981.  Congress  prohibited  Nicaragua from receiving assistance during 1981.

El  Salvador and  Honduras  became  the  major recipients  of security assistance  in  1981, with  El  Salvador receiving more at› tention because of  the fighting in that country. The United States provided $25 million in FMS credits to El  Salvador. In addition

El Salvador received $25 million worth of  security assistance by virtue of  two decisions made by the President under Section 506 of the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorized him to increase assistance by one-fourth of  the amount already approved by Con› gress without seeking additional authorization. El Salvador used $20 million  of Section  506 authority  to  draw on  Army stocks. Items provided included the lease of  six UH-lH helicopters. The U.S.  gave another eight UH-lHs to El  Salvador outright. The Army also provided a variety of  small arms, crew-served weapons, ammunition, clothing, and combat gear.

Relations between the U.S. Army and Latin American armies remained  generally  good  throughout  the  year.  The  proposed personnel exchange programs with Argentina and Chile and the passage of the Yatron Amendment, which approved incremental costs  for  IMETP recipient countries, helped  maintain good re› lations.  Before  1981  the Army prorated costs among students, that is, foreign countries paid the average cost per student. The incremental cost approach presumes that the Army would teach these courses for its own personnel whether or not foreign  stu› dents were present. The foreign  country is  charged,  therefore, only the additional or incremental  cost to the  Army caused by the added students.

## Security Assistance Affiliated Program

An  officer  who selects a  foreign  area  officer military  occu› pation specialty goes through rigorous training. After completing foreign  area  officer courses at the U.S.  Army  Institute for Se› curity Assistance,  Fort Bragg,  North  Carolina, the officer must obtain a  graduate degree  in  international relations or regional studies.  He or she spends one year in  the area of specialization and learns  one  indigenous  language.  Only  then  is  preparation complete.  Until  1981  the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence was  responsible for the overseas training of  for› eign area officers even though the  Office of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Operations and  Plans  was  the  proponent for  the foreign  area officer military occupation specialty (MOS).  In  the current fiscal  year Lt.  Gen. James  M.  Lee,  the director of the Army staff, transferred the responsibility to ODCSOPS effective January 1982. In other developments in the foreign area officer MOS, the Security Assistance Division in ODCSOPS established a  Foreign Area Officer Steering Committee as prescribed by the Department of the Army for all  MOSs.  The committee met on 16 July 1981, set up a series of topics that it planned to address

including the structure of foreign area officer management, and broke up into working groups. At the end of the year the Army staff was working on the new Joint Manpower Program for the Rapid Deployment  Joint Task Force. The new program reflected a substantial increase in foreign area officer positions.

The personnel  exchange  program  (PEP)  expanded  during 1981 from eighty-six positions in fifteen countries to ninety-four positions in  sixteen countries. The expansion included an agree› ment with Honduras for an exchange program as well as an in› crease of two  positions  for  Australia,  two  for  Canada,  one for New Zealand, and three for the United Kingdom. Exchanges with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom made up the bulk of the personnel exchange program in  1981-sev› enty-five  of the ninety-four approved positions.  At the close of the fiscal year the government was actively considering expansion of the program to Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico; moreover, the Departments of State and Defense authorized the Army to begin exploratory talks with the armies of Argentina and Chile. To assist efforts in Latin America, ODCSOPS designated the U.S. Security Assistance Agency, Latin America, as the focal point for regional matters of the personnel exchange program. The most important unresolved question affecting the future direction of the  program was  a  legal  one.  Some  countries  viewed  congres› sional  prohibitions concerning reciprocal arrangements for for› mal  training and medical  care as  impediments  to realizing the full potential of the program.

## 13. Special Functions

Special  functions  include activities  which  deeply involve the Army in the life of the civilian community. The civil works pro› gram  of the  Corps  of Engineers,  which  dates from  the  1780s, includes navigation aids, waterways improvement, support of the President's hydropower program, and disaster response and re› covery.  The Army's environmental protection and preservation programs are designed to bring Army practices into conformity with federal laws and regulations in an area of  increasing concern to the nation. The energy program involves the Army in a  co› ordinated, governmentwide effort to develop alternative energy sources and to conserve energy. The Army's  actions in all  three areas have become controversial as public concern about the en› vironment and energy has increased in  recent years. As a result, the Army has become involved in litigation concerning these mat› ters.  Finally,  in  compliance  with  national  policy  the  Army  tries to  use small  and disadvantaged  businesses  when  it awards  con› tracts.

## Civil Works

In fulfilling its  major water resources development and nav› igation responsibilities, the Corps of  Engineers also maintains, in peacetime, a  technical  work force  essential  for successful  mobi› lization.  As  the  decade  of the  1970s  closed,  expenditures  for operations and maintenance grew, while those for new construc› tion  began  to  decline.  The country's water  resources develop› ment program lacked  new  starts and  was  plagued by excessive delays and sometimes cumbersome regulations.

To invigorate water resources development and put the coun› try's  water program on a sound basis, the Reagan administration moved to implement a fresh approach, one built on a new model of public and private partnership. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works initiated reforms in the Corps' regulatory program, planning process, project financing,  cost sharing, and internal regulations.

On 17 February 1981 President Reagan signed Executive Or› der 12291  setting up the Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief and designated Vice President George Bush as chairman. The Corps worked with the Civil Works Assistant Secretary and

the  Office of Management and Budget (0MB) to identify  five basic issues that needed study and evaluation in the Corps' reg› ulatory program. They were as follows:  (1)  reduction of permit processing time; (2)  more authority for the individual states; (3) reduction  of overlapping  responsibilities;  (4)  expansion  of the Corps' general permit program; and (5) improved definition of program objectives and jurisdictional limits.

Several senators and representatives introduced legislation in the 97th Congress to redefine the  jurisdiction of  the Army Corps of Engineers  in  granting  permits  to  nonfederal  interests  for dredging and filling. The most notable legislation was the Tower› Bentsen Bill (S.  777),  which sought to limit Corps jurisdiction to tidal coastal  waters,  waters now navigable or reasonably capable of being made navigable, and historically navigable waters. The bill  would  remove  streams and adjacent  wetlands  upstream  of these limits from the jurisdiction of the Corps. Congress did not hold hearings on this  legislation during fiscal  year  1981.

Following the fall  1980 Division  Engineers Conference,  the Planning Division of the  Civil  Works Directorate in the Office of  the Chief  of  Engineers initiated an internal Regulation Reform Action  Program (RRAP) to review,  evaluate, and, as  necessary, reform  civil  works  planning  directives  and  publications.  The RRAP team recommended canceling thirty-one  of the existing 102 publications and consolidating or  eliminating the rest. It  con› solidated guidance into six  engineer regulations and four  engi› neer  pamphlets.  A  450-page Notebook replaced  1,700  pages  of guidance and 7,000 pages of information. This internal process continues and will  provide updates to the planning guidance.

Beyond  the  RRAP effort,  the  Director of Civil  Works also instituted a  Planning Improvement  Program  (PIP)  to  promote timely and economical completion of quality reports. Scheduled for  implementation during  the  PIP  of fiscal  year  1982  are  (1) creation of  planning divisions in districts; (2) improvement of  the Washington-level  report processing system;  (3)  encouragement of  better developmental assignments for planners; and (4) imple› mentation of the recommendations by the Civil Works' blue-rib› bon panel on report management. Most far-reaching of  these will be the mandatory attendance of district engineers at the Board of Engineers  for Rivers  and Harbors meetings dealing with  re› ports  from  their districts.  (The  Board of Engineers  for  Rivers and Harbors, established by Congress in  1902,  is  composed of seven senior engineer officers. Its primary role is to conduct in› dependent reviews of Corps water resources projects and report its conclusions and recommendations to the Chief of Engineers.)

In  March 1981  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works transmitted to Congress the administration's  proposed leg› islation for cost sharing  of  inland waterways and coastal and Great Lakes channels and harbors. These bills, S.809 and S.810, called for  full  cost recovery of federal construction and operation and maintenance costs for navigation projects. While the administra› tion indicated its intention to recommend higher nonfederal cost sharing  for  other  types  of water  projects,  it  made  no  further legislative  proposals during fiscal  year  1981.  The Senate  Envi› ronment and  Public  Works  Committee  held  hearings on  navi› gation  user charges but did not report out any legislalion.

Fiscal  year  1981  funds appropriated for the Corps of Engi› neers' Civil Works Program totaled $3.099,962,000. This figure represented a  decrease of $163,264,000 from  fiscal  year  1980 appropriations which had included $170 million in  flood control and  coastal  emergencies and  $45  million  in  operating mainte› nance and general supplemental funding for Mount St.  Helens. The decrease occurred primarily because of the lower  level  of funding for the Mount St. Helens emergency ($25 million) in the year just ended.  The  1981  appropriated funds  included  a  sup› plemental appropriation of $109.05 million, of  which $45.05 mil› lion was for pay increases. The table below provides a breakdown by title of  the total fiscal  year 1981  appropriations. The amounts include  funds  provided  by  the  198  l  Energy and  Water  Devel› opment Appropriation Act  (PL 96-367) and the  1981  Supple› mental Appropriations and Recession Act (PL 97-12).

The largest appropriation-Construction, General-permit› ted work on 213 specifically authorized projects and 13 elements of  the Mississippi River and tributaries project. Eighteen projects were completed during fiscal year 1981. The completed projects will provide local flood protection to 301.  7  41 acres of  flood-prone

land; reservoir storage to retain some 203,100 acre-feet of  runoff for flood  protection; and 167,300 acre-feet of  storage for water. Projects included improvements to one coastal harbor, 8.2 miles of deep-draft  navigation  channels,  5.4  miles  of beach  erosion control, three hydropower generating units with a  total installed capacity of  333,000 kilowatts, and four major rehabilitation proj› ects.

Authorized  full-time  permanent  civiljan  manpower  in  the Corps of  Engineers has declined 7.4 percent from fiscal year 1971 to 1981. The table below shows the changes from  I  971  through 1981.

Beginning in fiscal  year  1982, control of the Corps' manpower will  be  converted  to  the  full-time  equivalent of work-years  ex› pended rather than  the level  of full-time  spaces authorized for use at the end of the year.

The Interagency Coal Export (ICE) Task Force, in which the Corps played a  major role, submitted its report to the President in January  1981.  The ICE report concluded  the following: (1) world  demand for steam coal  would grow significantly;  (2)  Lhe United States would increase its future share of  world steam coal; (3) the internal port limitations in the United States would raise the  cost of steam  coal  for  foreign  buyers;  and  (4)  steps  would have to be taken to simplify, coordinate, and remove unnecessary delays  from  the  governmental  review  process  for  construction activities and to expedite implementation.

The Corps Institute for Water Resources neared the end of research on two specially mandated studies-the National Water› ways  Study and  the  National  Hydropower Study.  The institute held public meetings to presenL the basic conclusions that came

from the studies and to discuss potential recommendations. Most important, the waterways study concluded that waterway traffic, primarily  for  coal  and grain,  will  increase.  Although  projected growth  will  be  less  than  that experienced  in  recent years,  and could be even lower depending on the user fees finally adopted, several locks  will  become congested by the turn of the century, and the need for more efficient replacement locks wiJI  increase. The draft report predicted the need for about $6 billion in new investment (in  1977 dollars) by the year 2003, primarily for new lock chambers which  would  provide additional capacity and se› lected deepening of channels to increase transport efficiency in both the inland and deep channel segments of the waterway sys› tem.  Finally,  the National Waterways Study concluded that ap› parent  environmental  risks  would  be  predictable  and manageable.

The  National  Hydropower  Study,  begun  in  1977,  recom› mended a national  hydroelectric power development program, as  well  as  institutional and policy  modifications,  to  increase  the effectiveness of hydrodevelopment. in  the next twenty  years.  At the end of  the fiscal year the Corps headquarters, Corps elements, and other interested agencies were reviewing the draft.

The Corps, in cooperation with the U.S.  Department of En› ergy,  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  the  Depart› ment of the  Interior's Bureau  of Reclamation,  and  the  Rural Electrification  Administration  and  the  Farmer's Home  Admin› istration-both  from  the  Department  of  Agriculture-spon› sored an international conference on hydropower, Waterpower '81, in Washington, D.C., on 22-24 June 1981. The conference provided a forum for the exchange of ideas and information on hydropower among interested professionals and nonprofessionals in both government and business throughout the United States and in twenty-three foreign countries. Keynote addresses by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and by Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska highlighted the conference. The As› sistant Secretary challenged both public and private sectors to be more innovative and to search for more effective ways to  stimulate and finance hydropower production. Senator Murkowski urged conference participants to continue their efforts to capture this renewable resource.

Under  the  national  program  for  inspection  of nonfederal dams, the Corps of  Engineers updated and verified the inventory of  dams. The revised inventory listed over 67,000 dams, of  which about 21,000 were in the "high and significant hazard" category. By  the end of September 1981  the Corps still  had not obtained

the legislative authority it needed to keep the inventory current. Also under the program, the Corps inspected 8,794 dams and judged 2,917  of them, or 33 percent, as unsafe due to various deficiencies, primarily  for  inadequate  spillway  capacity.  The Corps gave  state  governors  copies  of inspect.ion  reports  on  all dams having deficiencies and recommended remedial measures. On the  bottom line, the Corps concluded  that (1)  the  updated inventory  of dams  is  a  reliable  data  base  for  state  dam  safety programs; (2) the large percentage of unsafe dams and the lack of implementation of remedial measures indicate that dam own› ers are not willing  to maintain  their dams and  that most states are not willing to require the needed maintenance; and (3) most states  have  shown a  willingness  to  implement and  maintain  ef› fective state dam safety programs if federally funded, but only a few states have indicated that they will  continue these programs with  federal assistance.

The Corps of Engineers Dam Safety Assurance Program was initiated with conditional operational studies conducted in  fiscal year 1980. The program is directed toward completed Corps of Engineers projects including those operated and  maintained by local  interests,  which  may contain potential safety hazards when viewed from  present day engineering standards and knowledge. The program intends to upgrade those features which  have de› sign  or construction  deficiencies  related  to  dam  safety  without changing the original project's purpose.

The fiscal year 1980 appropriations included $8.1  million for studies and designs  involving  17  0  projects.  Fiscal  year  I  981  ap› propriations included  $20.3  million  for  studies and designs  in› volving  130  projects  and  $0.8  million  for  construction  at  one project.

Several Corps projects generated special public interest dur› ing  1981.  The  Tennessee-Tombigbee  Waterway,  which  would connect Demopolis, Alabama, to Pickwick Pool on the Tennessee River, proceeded toward completion despite some continuing op› position. Total allocations since 1971 stood at $1.109 billion, leav› ing $671  million still  needed to complete the project.

The Flood Control Act of 1965 (PL 89-298) authorized the Dickey-Lincoln project on the upper Saint  John River, in Maine. While the project had rear:hed a stage at which construction could begin,  controversy  over  its  usefulness  made  the  prospects  of Dickey-Lincoln  uncertain; and by the end of the fiscal  year no construction funds had been appropriated.

T he  Lower  Snake  River  Fish  and  Wildlife  Gompensation Plan, authorized under the 1976 Water Resources Development

Act, was designed to compensate fish and wildlife losses associated with  the  construction  and  operation  of the  four  dams  on the Lower Snake  River.  Because commercial  hatcheries lacked  ex› perience with rearing anadromous fish,  the Corps argued that it should not seek authority  to  make a  contract with commercial hatcheries to supply steelhead trout.

Heavy rains coupled with saturated ground conditions in the Salt River Basin during 23-28  July 1981 caused high runoff  rates and a  rapid  rise  in  the pool created  by  the construction  of the Clarence  Cannon  Dam  in  Missouri.  The  resulting  overflow caused  damage  to  the  main  dam  embankment,  terminal  wells, sand chimney,  sand drain,  and  instrumentation.  The St.  Louis District Engineer  modified  the  existing contract  to permit the repair of the main  dam.  As  of 30 September  1981  the  repairs were essentially complete. Upstream embankment protection was now  provided  to  elevation  592.  To achieve  still  greater  flood protection  during the  1982  construction  season,  the St.  Louis District planned to raise  the embankment protection.

The Corps also devoted considerable effort to a study of the Atchafalaya  Basin,  Louisiana.  As  Mississippi  River  flood  flows increase, the project provides an additional outlet to the Gulf of Mexico by receiving flows through the Old River and Morganza Control Structures thereby  relieving  the  flood  threat  to  Baton Rouge  and  New  Orleans.  The  floodway  was  formed  by  con› structing protection  levees an average of eight miles to the east and seven miles to the west of the Atchafalaya River.  Because of extremely  poor foundation  conditions,  these  levees  are subject to  continuous  settlement.  The  levees  are  from  one  to  six  feet below  proper design  grade. The floodway  is  intended  to carry one half  (1.5 million cubic feet per  second) of  the Mississippi River project flood flow.

The primary object of this 1981  study was to develop a mul› tipurpose plan that would protect south  Louisiana from Missis› sippi River  floods  while  retaining  and  restoring  the  unique environmental features and long-term productivity of the basin's natural environment. The study addressed the operations of the Old River project; safe conveyance of  project flood flows through the  floodway  and  reduction  of sedimentation;  enhancement of fish,  wildlife, and recreation resources on the floodway; safe con› veyance of the projected flood waters through the outlets to the Gulf of Mexico;  and  protection  of the  backwater area  east of Morgan City,  Louisiana. A number of  alternative plans were de› veloped to meet the study objectives. The New Orleans District submitted a draft report and an environmental impact statement

to  the  Mississippi  River  Commission  on  20  March  1981.  The report  addressed  measures  requiring  congressional  authoriza› tion,  generally those  relating to  environmental  preservation, as well  as  the features  previously  authorized by Congress,  mainly for flood control.

The Corps held five  public  meetings between  14 July  1981 and 22 July  1981  to  hear comments on the tentatively selected plan. Subsequent to the public meetings, the governor of Loui› siana announced a  compromise real estate plan for the basin in cooperation  with  the landowners  in  the basin,  a  chemical  com› pany, and environmental interests. By the end of the fiscal  year the Corps had not officially reviewed the plan. Following a num› ber of  public meetings and suggestions by the governor, the New Orleans District Engineer will  submit a  final  report to the  Mis› sissippi River Commission.

## Environmental Protection and Preservation

Continued central management of  the Army Pollution Abate› ment Program (APAP)  during fiscal  year  1981  resulted in  sig› nificant progress toward bring Army installations into compliance with  applicable  air  and  water  standards.  The  fiscal  year  1981 Military Construction, Army (MCA), budget line funded twenty› two  projects at a  cost of $49  million.  Of the  116  installations identified in  1978 as not being in compliance with applicable air and water standards, only 17 will remain in noncompliance upon completion of all  projects in  the fiscal  year  1981  and prior year MCA programs. The Pollution Abatement Program will continue under central management by  the Office of the Chief of Engi› neers for the forseeable future, in anticipation that Congress will require the Army to comply with solid and hazardous waste stan› dards of the Resources Conservation and  Recovery Act (1976) and with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen› sation, and Liability Act (I  980).

Congress passed the comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act in  December 1980. This legis› lation,  popularly referred to as Superfund, provides for federal response authority and polluter liability for hazardous substances released into the environment.  The act also required  that busi› nesses  or agencies  report  to  the EPA  by  9 June  1981  any  past practices which might have caused hazardous or toxic substances to  be  introduced  into  the  environment.  The Army reported  a considerable  number of toxic  sites,  located  on  both  active  in› stallations and land previously disposed of as excess.  On 14 Au-

gust  1981 President  Reagan  issued  Executive  Order  12316, "Response to Environmental Damage," which made the Depart› ment of Defense responsible for hazardous substances on DOD installations. The department in turn delegated the responsibility to the secretaries of  the military services. The Office of the Chief of Engineers  informed  the field  of the areas of shared  respon› sibility for hazardous materials and hazardous waste management between the Army and the Defense Logistics Agency.

A groundwater monitoring program was initiated during fis› cal  year  1981  under  the  technical  direction  of the  U.S.  Army Environmental  Hygiene  Agency,  a  Health Services  Command unit, and the Huntsville Division of the Corps of Engineers. The program was  designed  to comply with  the  requirements of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act. As a consequence of this law,  all  Army activities  that handle  (transport,  treat, store, or dispose) hazardous waste filed applications with  the Environ› mental Protection  Agency (EPA) on  19 November 1980,  which would allow the facilities to continue operating under an interim status until the EPA promulgates final permit procedures. If the activities  had  not  requested  an  extension,  the  law  would  have required them to cease operation and contract out all functions involving hazardous waste.

In  January 1980 the Army published regulations in draft form for comment, which put in force the Council on Environmental Quality  regulations implementing the procedural  provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (  40 Code of  Federal  Reg› ulations 1500-1508). The Army published  the final  regulations in 32 CFR 651 on 20 October 1980, to take effect on 3 November 1980, and issued  the same  text as  AR  200-2 on  I  September 1981.

In 1975 the Army initiated the Installation Restoration Pro› gram under the direction of  the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency (USATHAMA), a  DARCOM field  operating agency which reports directly to the chief of  staff of DARCOM. The program involves the identification: assessment, and resto› ration of Army properties that have been contaminated by haz› ardous  materials.  USATHAMA  gave  priority  to  installations where contaminants were migrating beyond the post boundaries and to those that had been identified as excess and were planned for  release  to  other use.  Most field  work-some 85  to 90  per› cent-was performed  by  contractors  under  the  supervision  of USATHAMA. Over the past six years USATHAMA has under› taken assessments at  124 installations. The agency performed a record search, the first phase of  an assessment, at  each installation

to determine if the potential existed for contaminant migration. USATHAMA recommended follow-up survey work, the second phase of the assessment, for 4  7 of the 124 installations. As of  30 September  1981  USATHAMA  had  prepared fourteen  survey reports at  an average cost of  $330,000 per installation. As a result of its  assessment efforts,  USATHAMA estimated  that past op› erations  may  have  caused  environmental  degradation  at  195 Army installations. Because assessment activities were prioritized, the Army believes that most environmental contamination prob› lems have already been identified and are being addressed.

During  fiscal year  1981,  USATHAMA  performed  record searches at 38 installations. It initiated efforts, including ground› water  sampling  and  analysis  of data,  at  l O installations.  USA› THAMA completed survey work at 6 of the 10 installations and prepared survey reports on 3 of them:  Navaho Depot Activity, Arizona;  Fort  Wingate  Depot  Activity,  New  Mexico;  and Sac› ramento Army Depot,  California.  The  funding  level  for  fiscal year  1981  stood  at  $17.3  million.  USATHAMA  scheduled twenty-nine record searches and six surveys for initiation in fiscal year 1982. The agency anticipated the completion of  final reports on 12 installations during the same period. The funding guidance for  the  new  year,  as  of 30 September  1981, was  $13.7  million. USATHAMA assisted  the  Navy  in  establishing  its  Installation Restoration Program during fiscal  year 1981.

Fort Sill,  Oklahoma,  won  the  Secretary  of the  Army  Envi› ronmental Quality Award for its superior program during 1980. The Army Environment Committee selected Fort McClellan, Al› abama, as  first  runner-up and Fort Devens, Massachusetts, and Fort Huachuca, Arizona, as second runners-up. The committee judged the ten installations competing for this award on the over› all quality  of  their  written  presentation  and  their  program achievements.  In recognition  of the number of times that Fort Sill  had won  the award, the Undersecretary of the Army, James R. Ambrose, went to Fort Sill  to make the presentation person› ally.  The Army had held all  previous awards ceremonies at the Pentagon.

## The Army Energy Program

In August 1981  the Army Energy Office published the final version of the Army Energy Plan, first distributed in draft form in September 1980. The first major revision since the introduc› tion of  the plan in  1978, the 1981  edition included an update of

the world energy situation, program and funding  information, and consumption data to make the plan more useful.

The Army's total  energy consumption, as  compared to  the fiscal  year  1975  adjusted consumption  levels,  is given  below in trillion BTUs (British Thermal Units):

The Army divides its energy program into two  major com› ponents: installation operations and mobility operations. Most of the savings since  1975, some  14.89 percent, have accrued in in› stallations operations because of  the limits of  existing technology and because of the proportionately large amount of energy ex› pended in that area, 83 percent in 1981. The energy conservation program  for  facilities  covers  a  broad range of actions directed toward an overall reduction in energy consumption of  20 percent by  fiscal  year  1985  from  the  197  5  totals.  Included  within  this framework are actions aimed at shifting major energy loads from oil and natural gas  to coal, which is  far  more plentiful, and in› creasing fuel storage facilities  to minimize the impact of sudden supply shortages.

The Army has substantially reduced its energy consumption since  the  OPEC embargo of 1973.  Reductions are continuing, although  the descent is  less  rapid.  The decreased consumption has not been enough to offset the increase in  total energy costs that resulted from the rapid escalation in the unit costs of  energy, basically  oil,  natural  gas,  coal,  and  electricity.  Electrical  con› sumption  has  proven  the  most  difficult  to  reduce.  Many  local

management actions such as consolidation or inactivation of fa› cilities, changes in temperature standards, fine tuning of equip› ment,  and  increased  motivation  of personnel  have  contributed significantly to overall savings.

The greatest energy-saving contribution within the program is made by the Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP). It attempts  to  reduce  consumption  through  the  revamping of existing fixed facilities and will  play a  large role in achieving the 20-percent reduction in energy consumption per square foot in existing  Army  facilities,  mandated  by  Executive  Order  12003. Additionally,  ECIP  helped  offset  the  effect  of continually  in› creasing unit costs of  energy on the Army budget. ECIP includes projects to install insulation, storm or thermal windows, and space temperature controls; to improve heating, cooling, and electrical plants and distribution systems; and to introduce of  energy mon› itoring  and  control  systems  that  use  central  processing  units, waste heat recovery systems,  solar  hot water systems, and solid waste  incinerators  with  heat recovery.  Begun in  the fiscal  year 1976 program, ECIP was  scheduled in  1981  to extend at least through fiscal year 1987. As of 1981, Congress had appropriated $270.5  million  for  253  ECIP  projects.  The  table  below  sum› marizes the accomplishments of  ECIP (excluding family housing) since its inception, from  1976 to 1981.

The Energy Engineering Analysis Program (EEAP), initiated by  the Corps of Engineers in  1976,  is  an attempt to develop a systematic plan of projects to reduce energy consumption in ex› isting facilities.  All energy conservation techniques at each major Army installation are investigated to determine practicality and to quantify energy savings and costs. Techniques analyzed include major and minor building and equipment modifications, equip› ment replacements, energy management and control systems, and

operational  and  procedural  revisions.  From  the  EEAP  studies came a  list of projects, with priorities established by energy sav› ings  and  economic criteria,  for  funding  under  the  ECIP  or by the military construction authorization. EEAP also develops low› and no-cost projects to be implemented by installation personnel. On a selective basis the studies also analyze conversion from crit› ical petroleum-based fuels to coal or to renewable energy sources, such as solar or biomass.

As of 30 September 1981  the Corps of Engineers had EEAP studies under way  at 105 installations in  the continental United States, three in Alaska,  twenty-nine in  Europe, and nineteen  in Korea, as well as at ten locations in the Hawaiian Islands and six in Japan  and  Okinawa.  It  had completed  the  initial  portion  of the studies at an additional thirty-seven CO  NUS installations and seven  European.  In  the  fiscal  year  1981  program  the  Corps awarded 134 contracts and contract increments, valued at $17.4 million, for work at 126 different installations.

Approximately 67 percent of  the ECIP projects proposed for fiscal  year  1983  in  the continental  United States resulted from EEAP studies. Although representing only 39 percent of  the dol› lar  value  of all  ECIP  projects in  CONUS,  they account for  47 percent of the  projected  dollar  savings  and 54  percent of the energy savings.  In Europe  16.7  percent of the fiscal  year  1983 ECIP projects resulted from EEAP studies. This represented 5 percent of the dollar value of the European ECIP projects and accounted for 4  percent of the expected dollar savings and 6.7 percent of the energy savings.

The Army continued to expand the  use of solar energy on demonstration projects during fiscal year 1981. A family housing unit, heated and cooled by solar energy, became operational. It was the third project partially funded by the Department of En› ergy.  The Department of Defense provided the money for four projects during the same period, making a total of  thirteen DOD› funded facilities  within  the  Army.  The new projects included a school, a range operations center, a dining facility, and a hospital.

The Military Construction Authorization  Acts of 1979 (PL 95-356) and 1980 (PL 96-125) required the installation of  solar energy systems in all new facilities to the extent that such systems were cost effective.  As a result the Army constructed eight proj› ects  that  became  operational  during  1981  including  approxi› mately 950 family housing units using solar energy. The Corps of Engineers studied about twenty-five other projects during the year and found them not to be cost effective,  except for a  few

projects that were cost effective but which the Army did not have the necessary funds to build.

During  1981, shifting ideas of what constituted "cost effec› tiveness" had an impact on the Army's  effort in solar energy. In January  1980 the  Department of Energy published  regulations that established a  methodology for all federal agencies to use in determining cost effectiveness over the life cycle of  a facility. The fiscal year 1981 Military Construction Authorization Act (PL 96418)  contained  a  solar  requirement  using  essentially  the  same cost-effectiveness criteria as  found in previous acts.  Some thirty solar projects were cost effective  under those guidelines.  How› ever, the fiscal  year 1981  Military  Construction Appropriations Act (PL 96-436) contained a solar requirement that for the first time employed cost-effectiveness criteria similar to the new  De› partment of Energy regulations (10 Code of  Federal Regulations, Part 436, Subpart A).  Under the new standards only one solar project was  cost effective,  and  Congress  only  funded  it  in  the fiscal  year 1981  Military Construction, Army,  program.

Congress  subsequently  enacted  a  permanent  solar  energy evaluation  requirement  (10  USC  2688).  Design  studies  by  the Corps of Engineers for projects in  the fiscal  year 1982 military construction program took into account the requirements of 10 USC 2688 and 10 CFR Part 436. As the fiscal year ended, Con› gress was considering changing the requirements of  10 USC 2688 to bring it into conformity with  PL 96-436 and  10 CFR 436.

The February 1980 workshop on joint energy activities spon› sored by the Department of Defense and the Department of En› ergy sought to identify specific programs for  improving energy efficiency and availability and to locate DOD facilities  to use  in carrying out projects of mutual interest. As a consequence of  its participation, the Army selected during fiscal year 1981  the Red River Army Depot and Lonestar Army Ammunition Plant as the site  for  an  energy  "showcase."  Major  areas  of innovation  will include biomass, solar thermal, nonfossil' fuels,  lignites,  and ter› ratecture,  the construction of underground buildings.  The De› partment of Energy provided $204,500 to help start several of these programs.

## Army Litigation

Army activities  became  the subject of frequent  litigation in fiscal  year  1981.  There were  few,  if any,  significant Army pro› grams that were not made the subject of  a lawsuit. In particular,

contractors  challenged  many  actions  and  decisions  relating  to commercial interests as they  tried to retain or obtain contracts.

The Relook  cases,  which  concerned  officers  released  from active  duty  because  they  were  not selected  for  temporary pro› motion in  1975 and 1976, again constituted a  significant work› load  for  the Judge  Advocate  General's Corps.  The U.S.  Court of Claims had seventy-five cases involving 159 plaintiffs pending at the  close  of the fiscal  year,  while  the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia had another thirty-two cases pending involving 86 additional plaintiffs. The Army was  attempting to settle  those cases  which  the earlier decisions  in Dilley and Doyle resolved and, where necessary, to litigate the cases on issues not previously decided. In addition, the Army tried to get plaintiffs in  the  District of Columbia to transfer their cases  to the Court of Claims.  These cases,  however,  involved a  broad spectrum  of issues and would probably require years to resolve.  As an alter› native  to  litigation,  the  Army  was  considering legislation as  the year ended.

Although the Army had made some progress in resolving a number of the cases concerned with the testing of  hallucinogens, several remained before the courts as of 30 September 1981. In Stanley v. CIA, the Court of Appeals overturned the decision  by the district court favorable to the defendant and remanded the case to the lower court for possible amendment of the complaint. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dis› missed  the case  of Nagy v. United States for  lack  of prosecution. Pretrial discovery was completed in Loeh v. United States, and the case  was  set for  trial  in  district  court  in  November  1981.  The case of Chaffin v. United States was remanded in  the pretrial dis› covery stage. Sweet v. United States was tried in the spring of 1981, but the court had not announced a decision by the close of the fiscal  year.

Thornwell v. United States was dismissed after Congress passed a private relief  bill on Mr. Thornwell's  behalf. The  federal district court dismissed three related cases-Barrett v. United States, Bar› rett v. Hoffman, and Barrett v. Arthur-which concerned the death of  a civilian after an Army research contractor had administered mescaline, as being barred by the statute of limitations.

Two cases concerning the atmospheric  nuclear  testing pro› gram,jaffee v. United States and Broudy v. United States, were pend› ing decision by the appellate courts at the end of  the fiscal year. Three other cases, Punnett v. Carter,  Hinkie v. United States, and Hill v. United  States, were  still  pending  trial  proceedings  in  the district court. The district court, however, dismissed Lombard v.

United States on 30 September 1981. The  Judge Advocate General expected the Jaffee and Broudy cases to offer the earliest appellate resolution of  the question of  whether the Feres doctrine-which holds that the  United States is  not  liable  for  injuries  to  service members that arise from or were  incurred incident to military service-also bars suits for alleged intentional constitutional torts by individual officials of the government.

The district court had voluntarily dismissed during fiscal year 1980 the case  brought by the governor of Utah to prevent the movement ofWeteye bombs from Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Col› orado, to Tooele Army  Depot, Utah,  when  the Department of Defense decided  not to move  the  bombs.  However,  movement of the Weteyes became an important issue again in  1981, when the  department  reverted to  its  original  plan.  In Women's Inter› national League for Peace and Freedom v. Weinberger the plaintiffs sought an injunction to stop the movement of the bombs.  The district  court  denied  the  injunction,  however,  and  by  August 1981  the Army had safely  transported all  the Weteye bombs to Tooele Army Depot.

Medical malpractice cases continued to provide a  major part of the workload in tort litigation. The Torts Branch of the Lit› igation Division also handled numerous cases concerning aircraft and industrial accidents. Settlement negotiations were under way at the end of the year in  the case of United States v. Chamberland Manufacturing Company and Holcroft and Company.

While the number of medical care recovery claims dropped to 4,281, over 1,000 less  than during fiscal  year 1980, the total recoveries on behalf of the government actually rose to almost $5.8 million during fiscal year 1981. United States Army, Europe, continued its record of leading all  other offices with a  recovery of  almost $1.4 million.  The addition of another attorney in  the Tort Branch of the Office of the Judge Advocate General  and the implementation of  a newsletter to provide quick and uniform guidance to  Army attorneys in  the field gave  new emphasis  to medical care recovery efforts during the year.

The U.S.  District  Court for  the  Northern  District of Cali› fornia  returned a decision  favorable  to  the United States in the case of Mable Nevin v. United States, a  wrongful death action that arose from biological warfare testing on the West Coast in  1950. The government prevailed on  the issues of proximate cause and discretionary function.  (Discretionary function  is  the legal  doc› trine that an officer of the federal  government may not be sub› jected to civil  suits  on the basis  that he made the  wrong policy decision.) In Burchfield v. Gaon-a suit against Army doctors for

failing to diagnose the long-term effects of  nerve gas-the court, after denying a government motion for summary judgement, re› fused to substitute the United States as the defendant under Title 10, United States Code, Section 1089, which makes the United States the proper defendant for alleged  medical  malpractice by physicians in  the Department of Defense.

In the case of United States v. Reeves Telecom-brought by the government against a  land developer who built a dam that ulti› mately  undermined a  government railroad right-of-way-a de› cision on the amount of  damages that the developer would have to pay the United States was still pending at the end of the year.

The two class-action  cases  seeking  damages  and  injunctive relief for  alleged  violation  of civil  rights  in  the  Chicago  area, American Civil Liberties Union v. City of  Chicago and Alliance to  End Repression v. Rochford, neared settlement as the fiscaJ  year ended. The defendants had reached a settlement agreement with a ma› jority of the plaintiffs,  including a settlement of the class action allegations in both suits,  which required only final  approval by the court.

The settlement in  the case  of the Berlin  Democratic  Club v. Brown, which challenged intelligence-gathering activities in Ber› lin, was partially completed in the last fiscal  year. As required by the settlement  agreement, the thousands of  documents previously assembled and reviewed were released to the plaintiffs in  March 1981. The plaintiffs received several extensions of  time in which to  make  objections  to  deletions and withholdings  made by  the Army when it released the documents.

Katcoff v. Alexander, the lawsuit challenging the constitution› ality  of the Army's chaplaincy  program on the  grounds  that it violates the First Amendment to the Constitution, is  still in the pretrial discovery process. The Army will file a dispositive motion in  fiscal  year 1982, which should resolve the case.

At the end of the fiscal  year two cases, Lindenau v. Alexander and Mack v. Rumsfeld, were pending. These challenged the Army's policies on the enlistment of sole  parents in the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. Army regu› lations currently  proscribe  the  first-time  enlistment of any  ap› plicant, without spouse, who has a child under eighteen years of age,  unless  the  child  is  placed in  the custody of another adult, by court order or as prescribed by  state law;  the applicant for enlistment  is  not  required  to  pay  child  support.  The  plaintiffs asserted  that  the  policy  violates  the  equal  protection  and  due process clause of  the Constitution. The Army won the Lindenau case in district court, but the plaintiff appealed. The appeal was

pending at the close of  the fiscal year. The district court certified that the Mack case  was  a  class action.  The plaintiff pursued  an extensive discovery process, and the Army expects it to continue during fiscal year 1982 before trial on the merits.

In Rich v. Secretary of  the Army the plaintiff is a  former Army enlisted man whom the Army discharged because he had fraud› ulently concealed at the time of his enlistment that he had pre› viously engaged in  homosexual acts.  He challenged the Army's policy  concerning discharge of homosexuals.  After trial  on the merits,  the district court decided in  favor of the Army and dis› missed the case. The plaintiff filed a notice of  appeal; his appeal was pending at the close of the fiscal  year.

In Jackson v. Beasley the  plaintiffs  asserted  a  class  action  on behalf of all  Army recruiters assigned to the Southeast Region Recruiting  Command  who  received  unfavorable  personnel  ac› tions as  a  result of violations  of recruiting policy.  The Army's motion to dismiss or for summary  judgement was pending at the end of the fiscal  year.

The plaintiffs  in Huerfano-Pinon  Coalition,  Inc. v. Marsh brought  suit  challenging  the  proposed  acquisition  of  land  in southeastern Colorado for a training area for Fort Carson. They alleged  that  certain  provisions  of the  United  States  Code  au› thorizing  the  Secretary  of the  Army  to  purchase  land  are  un› constitutional. The Army  moved to dismiss  the complaint, and the motion was pending at the end of the fiscal  year.

During fiscal year 1981, the Tennessee~Tombigbee Waterway continued  to  be  the  focal  point  of complex  litigation.  On  20 October  1980,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court denied  the  plaintiffs' petition for a  writ of certiorari concerning the  trial  court's de› cision  on  the  authorization  questions.  On  1  October  1980  the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of  Mississippi ruled against  the  plaintiffs  on all  remaining  counts  of their  lawsuit, concerning environmental and economic issues. The court's de› cision touched on six major subject areas.

(1)  The Corps of Engineers, ruled the court, was  still  in  full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Corps had not improperly segmented the total project for purposes of its  NEPA environmental impact statement, because the  Tennessee-Tombigbee  Waterway  and  the  Black  Warrior› Tombigbee Waterway are separate and distinct projects. The en› vironmental  impact statement properly analyzed all  significant project alternatives. The Corps did not need to make a  formal supplement to its  1971  environmental  impact statement on the Tennessee-Tombigbee.

(2) The Corps' benefit-cost calculations were not reviewable by the courts. Congress determined that those benefit-cost ratios were adequate to justify the project's construction.

(3) The Tennessee-Tombigbee's official discount rate of  3.25 percent was  legal,  because  the  Secretary of the  Army  had  the discretion,  which  he  properly  exercised  in  1971,  to  determine that local  interests  had given satisfactory assurances of required local cooperation, thereby "grandfathering in" the 3.25-percent rate. (The official discount rate is  the interest rate that the gov› ernment is  expected  to  pay  on  money  borrowed  to  construct, operate, and maintain a facility over its lifetime.  A statistical  fic› tion used  to develop cost-benefit studies, it is  customarily based on the prevailing interest rate at the start of  a project.) The court also  found  that the  Corps  was  also  in  compliance with  Section 221  of  the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1970, which required that local  interests enter into contractual arrangements to pay  their portion of project costs before construction began.

(  4)  The plaintiffs' assertion that the Corps had not properly complied with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act was barred, because  those  claims  could  have  been  brought  up  in  the  1971 Tennessee-Tombigbee  litigation  and  because  the  statute  gave plaintiffs no private right of action.

(5)  The  Corps  properly  complied  with  Section  404  of the Clean Water Act and related regulations in dealing with the dis› charge of dredged material. The Corps also complied with Sec› tion  401  of the  same  act  regarding state  water  quality certifications.

(6) The Corps may or may not have published all  of the reg› ulations  which  it  should  have  published  in  r .he Federal  Register. The court refused to enjoin Tennessee-Tombigbee construction on the grounds of alleged failure LO publish such regulations.  If the plaintiffs cared to return to court, the court would consider an order requiring the Corps to publish all  heretofore  unpub› lished  regulations as  the law  requires.

In November 1980 the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals concerning Judge Keady's decision of l  October. On 13 July 1981  the court of appeals ruled that the Corps must prepare a supplementary environmental impact state› ment.  The language of the decision appeared  to open the pos› sibility that the plaintiffs might seek an injunction to stop all work on the waterway pending the completion of the supplementary environmental  impact  statement,  but  on  17  August  the  court clarified its position: There would  be no injunction. In practical terms the July 1981  decision  had no impact on construction; as

of 30 September 1981, completion was still scheduled for  1986. The court also  held in  its  13 July  ruling that the  3.25  percent discount rate was not legal, but it did not stipulate what the rate should be. At the end of the fiscal year this issue remained moot.

The case of Atchison,  Topeka,  and Santa Fe  Railroad Company et  al. v. Callaway originated  on 6  August  197  4  as  two  actions, subsequently consolidated, which sought to halt construction of Locks and Dam 26. This was one of a series of locks and dams extending from Alton, Illinois,  to St. Paul, Minnesota, and a key navigation structure affecting the entire inland waterway system of the midwestern United States. The plaintiffs alleged that the project was  the first step in a  multibillion-dollar plan to  rebuild the upper Mississippi River navigation system without the consent of  Congress, as required under Title XXXIII of  the United States Code, Section 5, and that the Corps of  Engineers had improperly assessed  the benefits,  costs,  feasible  alternatives,  and impact on national  economic  development and environmental  protection. The major issue  was whether Section  5 allowed construction of the  project without specific  congressional  approval.  The court issued a preliminary injunction on 5 September 1974 based upon the finding that the plans for the project went beyond the needs of  existing navigation by considering expected increase in traffic. The court also judged the environmental impact statement to be inadequate, because it did not consider the project on a systematic basis or investigate all reasonable alternatives. Subsequently, the Secretary of the Army terminated the authority for the project and directed that the Corps submit it to Congress for approval. On 2  May  1977  the court granted a  motion by  the defense  to dissolve the preliminary injunction  but denied its  motion to dis› miss;  the court required the federal defendants to respond to a motion for summary judgement filed by the plaintiffs.

The federal defendants filed a response to the plaintiffs' mo› tion  along with  a  cross  motion  for  summary judgement.  On  4 October 1978 the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia denied both motions for summary  judgement, except for the part of the  federal  defendants'  motion  which  argued  that  seeking congressional authority for a  new  project was  not arbitrary and capricious; the district court then set the case for a status call on 25  October  1978  to discuss  the  issues  to  be tried  in  regard to the environmental impact statement. Before the court could hold status call,  Congress passed Public Law (PL) 95-502, which au› thorized  one  new  1200-foot lock  and  dam,  created an  Upper Mississippi  River  Basin Commission to prepare a comprehensive master plan for the upper Mississippi River system based on spec-

ified  transportation  and  environmental  studies,  and  imposed a tax on fuel  oil  used in commercial waterway transportation.

The  district  court  then  allowed  the  plaintiffs  to  file an amended complaint. The federal defendants and the defendant› intervener,  the Association  for  the  Improvement of the Missis› sippi  River,  filed  a joint answer and  renewed separate motions for  summary judgement.  In  its  opinion  the court held  that  in passing  PL 95-502  Congress  did  not  exempt  the replacement Locks and Dam 26 from the National Environmental Policy Act; the plaintiffs were entitled to test the adequacy of the environ› mental impact statement which the Corps submitted to Congress with  legislation  that resulted in  PL 95-502.  On  10  September 1979 the court set the trial date.  On the morning of the trial, the  court dismissed  various counts  of the  plaintiffs' complaint leaving two issues to be tried: the adequacy of  the environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, and whether the federal  defendants had complied with postau› thorization  procedures.  The case was  tried in  five  days,  10- 12 and  18-19 September 1979.

On 23 October 1979 the court filed its memorandum of  opin› ion,  which  held  that  the  environmental  impact  statement  was adequate under the National Environmental Policy Act but that the  federal  defendants had failed  to hold  the  required postau› thorization meeting.  Although  the court entered a  declaratory judgement to this effect in  favor of the plaintiffs,  it refused to provide  injunctive  relief.  The court found  in  favor  of the  de› fendant on the issues arising from  the  National  Environmental Policy Act.

On 20 December 1979 the plaintiffs filed a notice of  appeal. Briefs were filed, and the court of  appeals heard oral arguments on  16 January  1981.  On  24 April  I  981  the court issued  its de› cision, affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's decision.  The reversal  was  limited solely  to  the  district court's failure  to  require  a  postauthorization  public  meeting.  The  St. Louis District of the Corps of Engineers held a  public meeting in September 1981. The plaintiffs sought  a writ of  certiorari from the Supreme Court, which was denied in  November  1981, thus concluding the litigation.

Loesch v. United States consisted of consolidated claims by six owners of  land that was adjacent to or on tributaries of  the Ohio River.  They sought to  receive  compensation  on  the  theory  of inverse condemnation for damage  to their  land  supposedly re› sulting from the construction and operation of high-lift dams on the Ohio River which they alleged caused erosion of their prop-

erties. Secondly, the plaintiffs accused the Corps of Engineers of fraud and misrepresentation in determining the ordinary high› water mark when it obtained flowage easement. In its finding the court indicated that both issues in the Loesch case hinged on the facts  rather than on questions of law.

The court found that the record in this case clearly established that the construction and operation of the Ohio River high-lift dams did not cause floods, increase the number of floods, affect peaks,  or  increase  the  effects  of flooding.  The erosion  taking place on the plaintiffs' land was  not caused by or related to the construction and operation of the high-lift navigation dams.  As to the alleged fraud,  the court ruled that the record showed an honest attempt by the Corps to be fair and forthright with all riparian landowners in the matters relating to the dam projects. It denied relief to the plaintiffs on this ground as well.

Deltona  Corporation v. United  States was  an  inverse  condem› nation suit in  which  the plaintiff alleged  that the Corps of En› gineers' denial  of its  application  for  a  Section  404  permit  to dredge and fill the wetlands at Marco Island in Monroe County, Florida,  south  of Naples,  imposed  "a  preservation  easement" upon their property. On 25 November 1980 the trial  judge issued a recommended opinion unfavorable to the government. On 19 August  1981  the  Court of Claims  rejected  the  recommended opinion and rendered a decision in favor of the United States.

The court held that while  Deltona may have sustained eco› nomic loss,  these  losses  did  not constitute a  Fifth  Amendment "taking."  The court cited the "stiffening"  regulatory  require› ment of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as the key legal event in this case.  The important  factual  event was  that  Deltona could  not show  that  the benefits of its  proposed project outweighed  the damage to the wetland resource and that the proposed alteration was necessary to realize these benefits.

The court cited Penn Central  Transportation  Co. v. New  York City when it rejected Deltona's  argument that the diminution in property value, standing alone, can establish a  taking. The true test for  takings is  whether or not the governmental action sub› stantially advanced  legitimate  federal  interests.  The court held that  the  permit denial  did  not extinguish any fundamental  at› tribute of ownership, nor did it prevent Deltona from deriving many other economically viable uses from its parcels. The Corps' regulations substantially advanced legitimate and important fed› eral  interests.

In A.F.  G.E. v. Brown the American Federation of  Government

Employees challenged contracting out under the Commercial In› dustrial Type Activities  Program at Fort Gordon,  Georgia; this case  was  pending before  the  appellate  court as  the  fiscal  year ended. The union made no appeal, however, from the dismissal of its  lawsuit concerning contracting out at Selfridge Air Force Base.

Litigation  still  continued  in  the  cases  against  Army  hiring policies in U.S.  Army, Europe, which favor German nationals or military dependents over other American citizens.

Equal employment opportunity class actions continued to con› cern the Army during fiscal year 1981. The Army won the first such suit that was actually tried, Lawler v. Alexander. In two other class actions, Godwin v. Alexander and Valdez v. Froehlke, the plain› tiffs  settled on  terms extremely  favorable  to  the  Army.  Never› theless, plaintiffs continued to file other significant class actions, most notably Emsley v. Weinberger and Harris v. Marsh. The former was  an  across-the-board class  action based  upon  alleged sexual discrimination, and the latter was based upon race. Several other class actions were still pending at the end of the fiscal year.

Plaintiffs filed a number of suits involving allegations of  per› sonal liability of  government officials, including the Secretary of the Army, during fiscal year 1981. For example, in Weiss v. Marsh the  plaintiff sued  the  Secretary  of the  Army  and other Army officials  in  their  individual  capacities  under  the Equal  Pay  Act and the Civil Rights Act.  The government moved to dismiss the allegations against the defendants in their individual capacities, but the court denied the motion pending trial on the merits. The case was  in pretrial discovery at the close of the year.

Litigation over the issue of negotiability  under Title VII of the  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  of 1978,  which  concerns  labor› management relations in  the federal civil service,  had become a major concern to the Army by 1981. The case of Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority challenged the decision by the district court that the U.S.  Forces, Korea, must negotiate ration control and vehicle registration regulations with the union. The case was briefed and was awaiting argument at the court of appeals at  the end of the year.

In one of the two suits challenging the Army policy that pre› vents the enlistment of  individuals who have had sex change op› erations, Jane  Doe v. Secretary  of  the  Army, the court decided  in favor of the Army; the plaintiff did not appeal. The other case, Joanne Michelle  Clark v. Harold Brown, was pending in  the Court of Claims,  but the parties were engaged in  settlement negotia› tions.

During 1981 debarment actions against government contrac› tors continued to be a matter of  concern, with some of the cases moving from  the  administrative  process  into  the  courts.  Once again the procurement activities of the Army and Air Force Ex› change Service became the center of considerable controversy.

In  addition  to  the  significant  cases  mentioned  above,  over 1,300 other cases were  pending against the Army as of 30 Sep› tember 1981.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The Department of  the Army during  fiscal year 1981 awarded $5.053  billion  in  small  business  prime  contract  awards,  or 25 percent of the amount awarded to all  businesses, against a  goal of $4.323 billion.  Actual accomplishments represented 117  per› cent of the  goal.  Contracts set aside  exclusively  for  small  busi› nesses,  covering those items which  can only  be bid on by small business,  increased to $2.6 billion against a goal  of $1.8 billion, or 12.  9 percent of  the total dollars awarded. T his was the highest percentage of contracts set aside for small  business  attained by the Army in any fiscal  year.

Contract awards to small disadvantaged firms totaled $801.4 million  in  fiscal year  1981,  an  increase  of 46  percent over  the previous  year.  Actual  accomplishments  represented  118.2  per› cent of the goal of $667.7 million.

It is  federal  policy  that businesses  owned by  women should have  the  maximum  opportunity  to  participate  in  contracts awarded by the government.  Although there is  no requirement to give preference to such firms,  Army contracting offices tried to help those businesses owned by women to compete for awards. Awards made to such firms reached a  total of $122.6 million in fiscal  year  1981, greatly exceeding the goal of $74.7  million.
