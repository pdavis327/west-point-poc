## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2021

## Introduction

For the Army, fiscal year (FY) 2021 began with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continuing to affect it. Although mitigation measures  developed  during  FY  2020  had  enabled  the  Army  to  resume many  activities,  albeit  in  a  modified  manner,  the  service,  along  with the rest of the world, entered the new fiscal year looking forward to the fielding of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus. The pandemic, in FY 2021, also would create continued requests for soldiers, especially those from the Army National Guard (ARNG), to assist civil authorities.

In FY 2021, the Army faced the by-then common state of beginning the fiscal year without an approved budget. The demand from combatant commands for Army forces remained high, but the new fiscal year would see a major change in overseas deployments as the United States withdrew from Afghanistan. The service's highest priority remained modernizationin  materiel,  doctrine,  talent  management,  and  organization-to  prepare for large-scale combat operations.

After the murder of Spc. Vanessa Guillén by another soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, the secretary of the Army had established, in FY 2020, the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee. In response to the committee's findings and recommendations,  the  service would  change  policies, processes,  and  programs during FY 2021 to improve its ability to build diverse, adaptive, and cohesive teams.

## The Army and the COVID-19 Pandemic

This chapter provides a brief overview of the Army and the pandemic in FY 2021. Other chapters contain more detail on how the pandemic affected the Army and what the service did to support civil authorities.

Two days before the end of FY 2020, the estimated number of deaths from  COVID-19  worldwide  passed  one  million.  Two  months  into  FY 2021,  the  number  of  pandemic  deaths  in  the  United  States  surpassed 250,000. That figure doubled by February 2021. By early July, the number of COVID-19 related deaths worldwide surpassed four million. Two days before the end of FY 2021, the United States recorded a total of 43,289,203 COVID-19 cases and 694,701 deaths.

As  FY  2021  began,  senior  Army  leaders,  like  their  fellow  citizens, understood  that  fielding  an  effective  vaccine  was  crucial  for  lifting or  lessening  restrictions  imposed  to  limit  spread  of  the  virus.  In  the meantime,  the  service  continued  its  efforts  to  sustain  operations  in  a COVID-19 world using various mitigation measures that it had developed during  FY  2020,  such  as  establishing  virtual  bubbles  around  training courses  and  training  events.  In  early  December  2020,  the  U.S.  Army Medical  Materiel  Agency  began  receiving  COVID-19  vaccine  orders from throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) in anticipation of the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization for a vaccine or multiple vaccines. The DoD's vaccine distribution plan, based on recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had  three  phases.  The  first  phase  vaccinated  healthcare,  emergency services, and public safety workers. It also included deploying personnel. The  second  phase  encompassed  high-risk  beneficiaries,  such  as  those with  compromised  immune  systems  or  other  health  conditions  that made them more vulnerable to the virus. The final phase moved to the rest of the eligible population.

In December  2020,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  issued emergency  use  authorizations  for  two  COVID-19  vaccines.  Although vaccination for military personnel remained voluntary under an emergency use  authorization,  senior  leaders  urged  soldiers,  their  family  members, and civilian employees to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Brooke Army Medical Center in Fort Sam Houston, Texas, administered its first vaccine doses to  medical  professionals  on  17  December  in  accordance  with  the DoD vaccination plan. Vaccination efforts accelerated in January, although vaccine hesitancy continued across all the military services.

Military support to civilian authorities continued during FY 2021, and, as during FY 2020, the ARNG provided most of the soldiers deployed for this mission. The service continued to send urban augmentation medical task  forces  (UAMTFs) to assist hard-pressed civilian hospitals. Between February and June, Regular Army (RA) personnel operated vaccination centers, a mission many governors also assigned to their ARNG units.

On  8  April  2021,  the  DoD  announced  that,  as  of  19  April,  the department would move into the vaccination plan's third phase, making all defense personnel and their family members eligible to receive the vaccine. On 19 April, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General James C. McConville urged all soldiers to get vaccinated: 'We need to do it for society, we need to do it for the team, and we need to do it for the Army. '

By early June, the rate of new COVID-19 cases in the United States had dropped to the lowest level since March 2020, but the rapid spread of the more transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant during the summer quickly  reversed  that  achievement.  As  the  infection  rate  climbed, installations returned to stricter health protection conditions, particularly those located in areas where the vaccination rate was below the national average.  These  measures  included  a  requirement  to  mask  when  social distancing was not possible.

In  July,  the  DoD  announced  that  all  military  and  civilian  DoD personnel would be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Personnel

unable or unwilling to do that would be required to wear a mask, physically distance,  comply  with  a  regular  testing  requirement,  and  be  subject  to official travel restrictions. By that same month, approximately 68 percent of  the  Army's  active  duty  personnel  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  a COVID-19 vaccine.  Vaccination  rates  in  the  reserve  components  were significantly lower.

In  August,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved  the  first COVID-19 vaccine for individuals age sixteen and older. Two days later, the secretary of defense directed the secretaries of the military departments to  begin  immediately  the  full  vaccination  of  all  members  of  the  armed forces. The secretary delegated to the military departments the authority for setting deadlines for service members to be vaccinated.

The Army's plan, announced  on  14  September, required RA soldiers  to  be  fully  vaccinated  by  15  December  2021  and  ARNG and  U.S.  Army  Reserve  (USAR)  soldiers  to  be  fully  vaccinated  by 30  June  2022.  The  chain  of  command  and  medical  providers  would counsel  soldiers  who  refused  the  vaccine.  Continued  refusal  to  obey this  order would result in administrative or nonjudicial punishmentincluding relief of duties or separation from the service. Soldiers could request an exemption from vaccination if they had a legitimate medical, religious, or administrative reason. Soldiers with a pending exemption request  would  not  be  subject  to  adverse  actions  while  the  exemption request was under review. Commanders, command sergeants major, first

sergeants,  and  officers  in  Command  Select  List  positions  who  refused to  be  vaccinated-and  whose  status  was  not  pending  an  exemption request-first would be suspended from their position and then relieved if they continued to disobey this order. Officers and noncommissioned officers  (NCOs)  who  had  been  selected  and  were  waiting  to  assume Command Select List command, key billet, or nominative sergeant major positions  likewise  would  be  subject  to  removal  from  the  list  for  those assignments should they refuse to be vaccinated without a pending or approved exemption. Also in September, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued executive orders requiring COVID-19 vaccination for all federal employees, subject to such exceptions as required by law, and requiring federal contractors to do the same.

By the end of FY 2021, the number of military personnel vaccinated against COVID-19 was 81 percent of the RA, 38.5 percent of the ARNG, and  40  percent  of  the  USAR.  Total  deaths  from  COVID-19  since  the pandemic began in 2020 were twelve in the RA, twelve in the ARNG, and eleven in the USAR.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

Secretary of the Army Ryan D. McCarthy resigned on 20 January 2021 as the Biden administration replaced the Trump administration. That same day, John E. Whitley, the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management  and  comptroller),  became  the  acting  secretary  of  the Army. On 15 April, President Biden nominated Christine E. Wormuth to be the next secretary of the Army. The Senate confirmed Wormuth on 28 May, and that same day she took the oath of office as secretary of the Army.

In March 2021, the Enterprise Cloud Management Office in Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army's  (HQDA 's)  Office  of  the  Chief Information  Officer  became  the  Enterprise  Cloud  Management  Agency with  its  designation  as  a  field  operating  agency.  The  agency  provides expertise  to  synchronize  and  integrate  the  Army's  transition  to  a  cloud computing environment.

In May 2021, the acting secretary of the Army directed a restructuring of the service's criminal investigation organization in response to recommendations made by the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee. The change aligns criminal investigations in the Army with the  best  practices  in  civilian  law  enforcement;  increases  the  service's ability to investigate felony crimes; maintains the independence of Army criminal  investigations;  and  ensures  that  military  special  agents  are ready to support expeditionary criminal investigative requirements. The restructuring  split  the  duties  and  responsibilities  previously  assigned  to one  general  officer,  who  served  simultaneously  as  the  provost  marshal general and the commanding general of U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. With the split, the provost marshal general remains a general officer in charge of military police and reports to the chief of staff of the Army. U.S.  Army  Criminal  Investigation  Command  became  U.S.  Army Criminal Investigation Division, and a new civilian position, the director of U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, was established as a Tier 2 member of the Senior Executive Service reporting to the undersecretary of the Army. In September 2021, Gregory D. Ford became the first director of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division.

In June 2021, the Army Enterprise Marketing Office, a field operating agency  of  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1,  became  a  field

operating  agency  of  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs). The office will continue to coordinate the Army's national marketing and advertising strategy, maintain relationships with  the  marketing  and  advertising  industry,  and  develop  marketing expertise and talent within the Army. This reassignment was not a physical move, as the office remained in Chicago, Illinois.

In  August  2021,  the  senior  official  performing  the  duties  of  the undersecretary  of  the  Army  directed  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Under Secretary of the Army to transfer five subordinate organizations to other HQDA offices. The Civilian Senior Leader Management Office and the Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service Members Project Office will be reassigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs). The Army Science Board will be reassigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA [ALT]). The Army Analytics Group will be reassigned to the Office of Business Transformation. The Test and Evaluation Office will be reassigned to the Office of the Under Secretary of the Army. All five transfers will be completed early in FY 2022.

The secretary of the Army is the DoD executive agent for the Military Postal Service and Official Mail Program and exercises this responsibility through the Military Postal Service Agency. In September 2021, the agency transferred  from  U.S.  Army  Human  Resources  Command  to  become  a direct reporting unit to the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1. The agency remained located in Arlington, Virginia.

## Management

In  November  2020,  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army (Financial Management  and  Comptroller) published Army  Finance Strategy  2026 .  Army  financial  management  functions  must  modernize their business processes, system environments, and workforce to improve support for the service's rebalancing of its strategic capabilities to better align with a new era of competition in a fiscally constrained environment. The  strategy  establishes  goals,  objectives,  and  a  continuous  process  to transform finance operations by FY 2026.

Business  operations  support  the  Army  in  performing  its  primary functions  to  organize,  staff,  train,  equip,  and  sustain  forces.  In  April 2021,  the Army  Business  Management  Plan,  2021-2025 superseded  the Army Business Strategy, 2017-2021 .  The plan will systematically improve business practices and processes and optimize the service's workforce by changing approaches to talent management. It contains goals, objectives, and initiatives aligned with The Army Strategy . Implementation of the plan will produce three strategic outcomes: reinvestment of time, money, and personnel  savings  in  higher  Army  priorities;  continuous  improvement of  the  service's  business  processes;  and  agile  response  to  evolving  Army business needs. The Office of Business Transformation will revise the plan annually through 2025.

In January 2021, the secretary of defense directed a review of all DoD advisory committees, including those not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The review's purpose was to align the committees' efforts with  the  most  pressing  strategic  priorities  and  the National  Defense Strategy . The  secretary  also  directed  the  immediate  suspension  of  all advisory committee operations until the review was completed. The review required each committee's DoD sponsor to examine the business case for the committee and prepare a fact-based justification for continuation of the committee. The DoD review board recommended continuation of all seven Army committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. By the end of FY 2021, the secretary of defense had approved the continuation of five of these committees.

Since the Army began the continuous process improvement program in FY 2006, it has delivered an average annual financial benefit, in savings and cost avoidance, of $1 billion. In FY 2021, it produced a financial benefit of $1.1 billion. The program trains practitioners to improve the performance of  Army  business  operations.  Because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  all process improvement training remained virtual. In FY 2021, the program produced  107  new  practitioners.  The  Business  Process  Reengineering Center of Excellence at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, conducts a three-tiered training program. In FY 2021, 161 students completed the Tier

One Foundation Course, 73 students completed the Tier Two Intermediate Course, and 2 students attained Tier Three advanced certification.

The Office of Business Transformation established the Army Contract Efficiencies Course. The course develops skill in managing the requirements-to-procurement  process  and  is  open  to  both  soldiers  and civilian  employees  serving  in  a  requirements  generation,  contracting, acquisition, or category management position. It consists of two weeks of in-person instruction or three weeks of virtual instruction, followed by a twelve-week capstone project. The project identifies improvements, which can achieve significant return on investment for the student's command and the Army.

The Army Gift Program manages the acceptance and disposition of gifts of real property, personal property, or money offered to the service for the benefit of its organizations and personnel. During the fiscal year, the program processed 1,002 gifts valued at $72 million from private citizens, corporations, community organizations, and state and local governments.

In FY 2021, 4,259 Army personnel participated in 183 conferences at a total cost of $3.7 million. The Army hosted twenty of these conferences, and other organizations hosted the remainder.

## Information Management

As part of the service's transition to cloud-based computing systems, in July 2021 the Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems closed down the enterprise web portal Army Knowledge Online (AKO). AKO had been created as a general officer email system in 1998. After the terrorist  attacks  on  11  September  2001,  the  Army  assigned  all  soldiers and civilian employees an AKO account so they could receive emergency messages. The system gradually expanded its capabilities beyond email to include  file  storage,  document  collaboration,  directory  services,  instant messaging,  and  training.  Although  Army  email  accounts  migrated  to the  Defense  Enterprise  Email  system  in  2013,  AKO  continued  in  both classified and nonclassified versions. In 2019, the service launched AKO 2.0, a version of the portal designed to be mobile device-friendly and to facilitate collaboration via online communities. The system achieved some of its highest usage during the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 1.5 million unique visitors monthly. The Army's adoption of cloud computing and newer feature-rich collaborative platforms, however, made AKO less useful, leading to the portal's closure.

The Army Digital Oversight Council, established in FY 2021, serves as the integrator of information technology (IT) and cyber efforts in the planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  processes.  It  ensures the IT and cyber budgets align with Army priorities and helps with the

technical integration of digital transformation efforts across the service. HQDA's chief information officer chairs the council, which reports to the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army.

In  September 2021, the chief information officer created the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Steering Group to develop Army-wide strategic guidance  and  direction  for  implementing  the  transition  to  IPv6.  In accordance with the DoD guidance, the Army must have 80 percent of its internet-enabled assets operating in an IPv6-only environment by the end of FY 2025. The steering group will develop the service's IPv6 policy, identify opportunities for IPv6-only pilots, and produce an IPv6 implementation and transition strategy to achieve the milestones directed by DoD.

The  Army  implemented  an  alternative  multifactor  authentication solution. This solution augments existing username and password logins by adding a second factor for authentication. The alternative permits Army personnel who do not have a government-furnished computer, including those in the reserve components, to access official online resources without a common access card. This capability is available for all applications using the Enterprise Access Management Service-Army platform. The solution provides  two  options:  a  Fast  Identity  Online-certified  cryptographic hardware  token  that  can  be  purchased  through  online  retailers,  or  the Army  MobileConnect  application,  which  can  be  downloaded  for  free. Implementing multifactor authentication solutions will shrink the Army's cyberattack surface because single-factor authentication accounts for the majority of security breaches across the internet. Multifactor authentication also improves defenses against online threats such as phishing, man-inthe-middle, credential stuffing, and replay attacks.

During FY 2021, the Army continued reducing its use of data centers. The  Army  Data  Center  Consolidation  Program  closed  or  redesignated seventy-seven data centers. These actions produced a cost savings or cost avoidance of approximately $633,000. Since the start of the program in 2016, the service has closed 722 of what had been a total of 1,102 data centers.  Two  Army enterprise resource planning programs moved from data  centers  to  cARMY,  the  Army's  cloud  services  provider:  the  Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program Hub in January and the Logistics Modernization Program in August.

The Army continued to improve its office productivity with new IT systems  during  FY  2021.  In  FY  2020,  it  fielded  the  commercial  virtual remote  (CVR)  service  as  a  temporary  measure  to  handle  the  massive increase  in  telework  created  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Teleworkers could use personal computers to access the CVR and work together on projects from their homes. Only data cleared for public release could be sent via the CVR. The CVR opened on 30 March 2020, and by 28 May 2020 there were 1,280,000 Army CVR accounts.

During  the  first  half  of  FY  2021,  the  Army  planned  to  field  the Microsoft  Office  365  cloud-based  suite  of  programs,  but  in  April  2021, the  Army Planning Board decided instead to use the Army 365 system developed for U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) and supported by U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command. Army 365 is a secure, cloud-based suite of products that merges Microsoft Office applications with voice, video, chat, and file-sharing capabilities. The service decided to purchase 950,000 Army 365 licenses from the contractor. This number was not enough to provide access to the system for all soldiers, civilian employees,  and  contractors.  By  the  end  of  FY  2021,  the  Army  had  not determined how personnel not covered by a license would use email and other applications in Army 365.

In May 2021, HQDA issued the order for the service's three-phased transition to Army 365. The first phase, ending on 15 June 2021 with the CVR's inactivation, was moving the service's Microsoft Teams environments from the CVR to Army 365. Data did not transition automatically, requiring all users to back up their data and transfer it to Army 365. The second phase is moving Army email accounts from the Defense Enterprise Email system to  Army 365. It began in July 2021 and is expected to be completed by 31 March 2022. The final phase is transitioning all SharePoint environments to the Army 365 SharePoint online application. This phase began late in FY 2021 and is expected to be completed by FY 2022's fourth quarter.

The Commercial Solutions for Classified program adapts commercial products for DoD secure networking operations. In FY 2021, the Army's efforts in this area transitioned from a pilot phase to an approved program status. This capability enables Army personnel to remotely access classified networks via their commercial internet connection by protecting classified data through multiple encryptions, firewalls, and network layers to ensure point-to-point protection.

## Audits

In FY 2021, an independent public accounting firm conducted the annual audits of the Army's General Fund and Working Capital Fund financial statements.  Both  audits  resulted  in  a  disclaimer  of  opinion  by  the  firm because it could not conclude whether the service presented the financial statements  and  related  notes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting principles. The firm concluded that the Army did not provide sufficient evidence to support the information in the financial statements because of inadequate processes, controls, and records to support transactions  and  account  balances.  The  audit  revealed  thirteen  General Fund and fourteen Working Capital Fund material weaknesses related to the Army's financial reporting processes and internal control environment.

## Budget

The Army's FY 2021 base budget request supported the service's priorities of  people,  readiness,  modernization,  and  reform.  It  had  an  increase  of $3.8 billion compared to the amount enacted in the FY 2020 base budget; the  increase  was  mostly  in  the  military  personnel  and  the  operations and maintenance accounts ( Table 1 ).  The FY 2021 overseas contingency operations  request  continued  Army  support  for  Operation  Freedom's Sentinel,  Operation  Inherent  Resolve,  Operation  Spartan  Shield, and  the  European  Deterrence  Initiative.  The  request  had  a  decrease  of $5.9 billion from the amount enacted in the FY 2020 overseas contingency operations budget; the decrease was mostly in the procurement and the operations and maintenance accounts ( see Table 2 ).

At the end of FY 2020, Congress had not approved the Army's budget for  FY  2021.  Instead,  the  service  operated  until  27  December  from  five continuing  resolutions that provided  funding  allocations  pegged  to FY 2019-enacted levels. Operating under a continuing resolution places restrictions on new starts, ongoing program expansions, production rate increases, and the reprogramming of funds.

Congress  enacted  a  total  budget  that  was  $1  billion  less  than  what the  Army  had  requested  for  FY  2021  ( see  Tables  3 and 4 ).  Among  the changes made by Congress to the request were a decrease of $1.9 billion to  operations  and  maintenance  accounts,  a  decrease  of  $462  million  in military personnel accounts, and an increase of $1.3 billion to the research, development, test, and evaluation accounts.

Several  events  created  challenges  to  efficient fiscal management by  the  service  during  FY  2021.  Following  the  insurrection  at  the  U.S. Capitol  Building  in  Washington,  D.C.,  on  6  January  2021,  the  ARNG provided security support to the United States Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies until May. In July, Congress approved supplemental funding of $231 million for the ARNG personnel account and $218 million for  the  ARNG  operation  and  maintenance  account  to  replace  funds expended during this deployment.

Following  the  withdrawal  of  all  U.S.  troops  from  Afghanistan  in August  2021,  Army  forces  participated  in  Operation  Allies  Refuge and Operation Allies Welcome. Funding to support these operations came from Army accounts and from reimbursements to the Army from the  Defense  Security  Cooperation  Agency's  overseas  humanitarian, disaster, and civic aid (OHDACA) account and the Department of State's emergency refugee and migration assistance account. By the end of FY 2021, Army units in these two operations had obligated more than $885 million from the OHDACA account, $72 million from the emergency refugee  and  migration  assistance  account,  and  $98  million  from  the

Delta in October 2020 and $1.1 million after Hurricane Ida in August 2021. The service executed $3 million to aid Haiti after an earthquake there in August 2021 and $100,000 to support state and local authorities fighting wildfires in the western United States.

A  20  January  2021  presidential  executive  order  terminated  barrier construction on the U.S. southern border. In July, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers returned $2.2 billion appropriated for these projects to the military  construction  accounts.  The  secretary  of  defense  then  approved applying $648.9 million of these funds toward twenty-one of the Army's thirty deferred military construction projects, eleven for the RA and ten

for the ARNG. Of the remaining nine projects, two were shifted into FY 2023, and seven will be funded by a partner nation.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided the Army General Fund $1.3 billion by the end of the fiscal year. The largest portion of this amount, $888 million, was for the Army's operation and maintenance account.

By the end of FY 2021, the Army had executed 99 percent of both its military personnel appropriations and its operation and maintenance appropriations.  In  the  FY  2021-2023  procurement  appropriation,  the service had obligated 77.2 percent of the available allotment against the 80 percent goal set by DoD for the first year of availability. The Army did not  meet  this  goal  because  it  did  not  receive  these  appropriations  until 27 December 2020 and it concentrated on executing the FY 2020-2022 procurement  appropriation.  For  this  appropriation,  the  Army  exceeded DoD's 90 percent obligation in the second year of availability standard by 4.7 percent. The Army executed its expiring FY 2019-2021 procurement appropriation  at  99.6  percent.  It  disbursed  47.2  percent  of  its  FY  2021 research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation  appropriation  against  the 55 percent goal set by DoD. The service disbursed 84 percent of its expiring FY 2020 appropriation in this account.

In the FY 2021-2025 military construction, Army, appropriation, the service awarded contracts for five of fifteen projects for a total of $229.5 million. The ten remaining projects were not awarded because of environmental, site, or solicitation issues, but are scheduled for award in  FY  2022.  Unobligated  funding  in  the  amount  of  $580.8  million remains  available  for  the  remaining  FY  2021  projects,  adjustments to  prior  year  projects,  minor  construction  projects,  contingencies, contract adjustments, and for reprogramming to other RA construction projects  in  the  event  of  cost  growth.  In  the  FY  2017-2021  military construction,  Army,  appropriation,  thirteen  of  fifteen  projects  were awarded for a total of $327.4 million. The remaining two projects were no longer required because of operational changes. Funding from the two  canceled  projects  was  reprogrammed  to  offset  cost  overruns  in other military construction projects.

In the military construction appropriation for the ARNG,  the service  awarded contracts for eleven of twenty-two projects. The eleven remaining projects were not awarded because of environmental, site, or solicitation issues, but are scheduled for award in FY 2022. Unobligated funding  in  the  amount  of  $135.6  million  is  available  for  remaining  FY 2021  projects,  adjustments  to  prior  year  projects,  minor  construction projects,  contingencies,  contract  adjustments,  and  for  reprogramming to other ARNG construction projects in the event of cost growth. In the FY  2017-2021  military  construction  appropriation  for  the  ARNG,  all

thirteen projects were awarded. In the FY 2021-2025 military construction appropriation  for  the  USAR,  the  service  awarded  contracts  for  two  of five projects. The three remaining projects were not awarded because of environmental, site, or solicitation issues. In the FY 2017-2021 military construction appropriation for the USAR, the service awarded contracts for all forty-four projects.

In FY 2021, the Army awarded $28.01 billion in prime contracts to small businesses. This amount was 29.58 percent of all Army prime contracts, exceeding the fiscal  year  goal  of  27.86  percent.  The  percentage  was  less than  in  FY  2020,  when  30.55  percent  of  prime  contracts  went  to  small businesses. However, in FY 2021, the amount awarded in prime contracts to small businesses was greater than in FY 2020, when $24.3 billion went to small businesses. The top category for prime contracts awarded to small businesses in FY 2021, with $6.97 billion, was pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing. The Office of Small Business Programs published the first annual report on Army small business activities in April 2021.

The Army Working Capital Fund consists of two activity groups: supply management and industrial operations. The first group buys and manages spare and repair parts for sale to its customers, primarily Army operating units. The second group provides the Army an organic industrial capability. The fund uses a revolving fund concept, relying on revenue from sales to finance operations rather than direct appropriations from Congress. The Army does request some direct appropriations for the fund to maintain its capability to meet mobilization and wartime surge requirements.

At the start of FY 2021, the fund's cash balance was $1.3 billion, which was $223 million below its lower operating requirement. The cash balance continued its decline through the first quarter of FY 2021 because of high disbursements from inventory deliveries and low collections from reduced supply  management  demand  and  depot  operations.  By  December,  the balance had fallen to $626 million. In January, the Army started executing cash  mitigation  actions  such  as  filling  low  priority  supply  backorders to  generate  sales  and  cutting  the  supply  management  activity  group's obligation authority to less than 80 percent of its sales volume to reduce cash outlays. In addition to internal actions, the fund received $201 million in direct appropriations and $920 million from a budget reprogramming action. The fund ended FY 2021 with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which was within its operating requirement limits.

The  FY  2022  budget  request  is  aligned  with  the  Interim  National Security  Strategic  Guidance  and  continues  to  support  the  Army's  focus on people, readiness, and modernization ( Table 5 ).  It  provides  for  a  RA of  485,000,  an  ARNG  of  336,000,  an  USAR  of  189,500,  and  a  civilian workforce of 196,710. The Army will fund twenty brigade-level combat training center rotations in FY 2022.

FY 2022 President's Budget Highlights , May 2021

Compared to the FY 2021 enacted appropriations, there are decreases in  the  procurement  and  research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation appropriations  for  FY  2022.  The  request  resources  current  capabilities and  applies  intentional  production  delays  to  remain  focused  on  the  six modernization  priorities  and  the  signature  efforts  set  out  in  the Army Modernization Strategy . This focus will permit the service to begin fielding next generation capabilities by 2028.

Beginning with the FY 2022 President's Budget, there will no longer be a separate request for overseas contingency operations. Instead, funding for these operations is included in the base budget request and is identified as either a direct war cost or an enduring cost ( Table 6 ). Direct war costs include  support  for  Operation  Freedom's  Sentinel  and  Operation Inherent  Resolve  along  with  separate  appropriations  for Afghan security forces and for training and equipping forces opposing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Enduring costs include activities in a theater of operations and in the continental United States that will continue after combat operations as well as the European Deterrence Initiative.

The Army  began FY 2022 without an approved budget. The congressional continuing resolution that enabled the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2021 levels. The continuing resolution did not extend defense emergency funding for natural disasters or response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Army Strength and Distribution

At the end of FY 2021, the Army's three components had a total of 1,008,373 soldiers.  This  represented  a  small  reduction  of  1,842  from  the  previous fiscal  year.  The  RA  end  strength  was  486,490:  78,769  commissioned officers, 14,674 warrant officers, 388,564 enlisted soldiers, and 4,483 cadets at  the  United  States  Military  Academy.  The  end  strength  of  the  ARNG was  337,525:  37,855  commissioned  officers,  8,934  warrant  officers,  and 290,736  enlisted  soldiers.  The  USAR  end  strength  was  184,358:  36,033 commissioned  officers,  3,615  warrant  officers,  and  144,710  enlisted. Women constituted 16 percent of the RA, 19 percent of the ARNG, and 25 percent  of the USAR.  Racial  and  ethnic  minorities  constituted 46 percent of the RA, 35 percent of the ARNG, and 50 percent of the USAR. Twenty-four percent of cadets at the United States Military Academy were women, and 36 percent were racial or ethnic minorities.

## Officers

The  Army  accessioned  10,565  new  officers  in  FY  2021.  The  Reserve Officer  Training  Corps,  with  5,534,  accounted  for  the  largest  share.  It commissioned 3,132 into the RA, 1,465 into the ARNG, and 937 into the USAR. The United States Military Academy produced 984 officers for the RA. In-service Officer Candidate School commissioned 309 lieutenants: 172 in the RA and 137 in the USAR. The college-option Officer Candidate School program produced 803 new lieutenants: 480 for the RA and 323 for the USAR. The ARNG's state-based and federal Officer Candidate School programs commissioned 264 officers.

There  were  2,317  direct  commissions  in  this  fiscal  year.  Thirty-two went into the Army's basic branches: 3 in the RA and 29 in the ARNG. The Judge Advocate General had 119: 87 RA and 32 ARNG. The U.S. Army Medical Department had 1,623: 1,185 RA, 342 ARNG, and 96 USAR. The Chaplain Corps had 575: 138 RA, 55 ARNG, and 382 USAR. There were an additional 322 RA officers commissioned into the Medical Service Corps and Army Nurse Corps.

Diversity within the officer corps was similar to previous fiscal years ( Tables 7, 8, and 9 ).

In the RA commissioned officer corps, 49 percent of company grade officers and 87 percent of field grade officers were married. Eighty-two

percent of warrant officers were married. Among commissioned officers, 28 percent of company grade officers had children, and 74 percent of field  grade  officers  had  children.  Seventy-three  percent  of  warrant officers had children.

In  the  ARNG  commissioned  officer  corps,  48  percent  of  company grade  officers  were  married,  as  were  84  percent  of  field  grade  officers. Seventy-six percent of warrant officers were married. Fifty-one percent of ARNG company grade officers had children, and 91 percent of field grade officers had children. Seventy-eight percent of ARNG warrant officers had children. In the USAR commissioned officer corps, 50 percent of company grade  officers  were  married,  and  78  percent  of  field  grade  officers  were married.  Seventy-six  percent  of  USAR  warrant  officers  were  married. Twenty-four percent of USAR company grade officers and 56 percent of USAR field grade officers had children. Fifty-four percent of USAR warrant officers had children.

Managing talent  for  a  diverse  officer  corps  remained  a  top  priority for the Army. The service conducted the Army Talent Alignment Process 21-02 and 22-01 marketplaces through the Army Interactive Module 2.0. This system allowed officers and units to list their preferences based on required  knowledge, skills,  and  behaviors.  The  module  provided  a  twosided,  transparent,  customizable,  and  filterable  site  that  allowed  both units and officers to seek each other out and match preferable candidates to preferable locations. Although the Army launched these programs in FY 2020,  the  2021  cycles  were  the  first  to  utilize  the  new  Army  Talent Alignment algorithm preferences.

The  Army  implemented  two  changes  in  officer  military  education: a  Pre-Command Course redesign and the introduction of the Tailored, Talent-Based  Military  Education  Level  4  courses.  The  Pre-Command Course redesign  required  selected  officers  to  attend  phased  educational courses focused on a command type. Additionally, nontactical battalion and brigade commanders had the opportunity to attend the newly designed Functional  Commanders  Development  Course.  The  Tailored,  TalentBased Military Education Level 4 courses are for officers who have been selected for promotion to major but have not been selected for resident Intermediate Level Education. The new program allows those officers to attend a fifteen-week satellite Common Core Course in lieu of the resident Intermediate  Level  Education.  Following  completion,  these  officers  will attend  the  Army  Operations  Course  in  residence  at  the  Command  and General Staff College. The first Tailored, Talent-Based Military Education Level 4 offering of the Army Operations Course will begin in January 2022.

Reserve officers also took advantage of professional military educational opportunities in FY 2021. Reservists filled 116 Intermediate Level  Education  seats  and  54  resident  Senior  Service  College  seats  left

vacant by active personnel. This represented a 16 percent increase above the normal quota for reserve officers. Overall, more than 5,000 orders were cut for USAR officers attending professional military educational courses, including  those  in  the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Department,  Chaplain,  and Judge Advocate General branches.

The  Army  continued  to  implement  changes  to  officer  promotion methods begun in  previous  fiscal  years.  In  FY  2021,  HQDA  executed its  second brevet cycle with fifty-six senate confirmed and temporarily promoted  officers.  Twenty  additional  officers  were  nominated  and  in the  process  of  receiving  brevets  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  HQDA also  expanded  command  assessment  program  opportunities  following the successes of the Battalion Command Assessment Program and the Colonels Command Assessment Program in FY 2020. In total, 707 Army officers participated in the second iteration of the Battalion Command Assessment  Program  held  between  30  October  and  18  November 2020.  Additional  command  assessment  programs  focused  on  more targeted demographics. Seventeen officers participated in the inaugural Acquisition Leader Assessment Program. The Army Talent Management Task Force developed a Medical Command  Assessment  Program and  a  Division  Chaplain  Assessment  Program,  both  of  which  will  be implemented in FY 2022.

In May 2021, the service instituted a policy for the direct appointment of RA senior NCOs to the rank of chief warrant officer two in special forces after completing Warrant Officer Candidate School. This is an exception to the Army's practice of appointing all warrant officers to the rank of warrant officer one regardless of their respective career fields or previous rank. The change, made after the success of a pilot program begun in FY 2020, is in response to the shortage of qualified chief warrant officer twos in special forces.

## Enlisted Personnel

The  RA  achieved  its  recruiting  and  retention  objectives  in  FY  2021 despite the COVID-19 pandemic limiting face-to-face recruiting options and closing recruiting stations. A decreased propensity to serve among 17- to 24-year-olds added to the challenge: only 30 percent of potential recruits  in  this  age  range  met  Army  eligibility  requirements,  and  only 12 percent indicated an interest in serving in the military. The service overcame these challenges by focusing on virtual recruitment and holding a National Hiring Days event in the summer of 2021. As a result of these efforts, the RA enlisted 106 more people than its FY 2021 mission for a total of 57,606 recruits.

The RA reenlisted 58,141 soldiers whose term of service was set to expire in FY 2021, which was 103 percent of its retention mission. U.S. Army  Human  Resources  Command  helped  facilitate  this  achievement by  managing  $353.3  million  in  retention  bonuses.  It  maintained  a  FY 2020 extension process for soldiers who were within six months of their separation date instead of the previous policy that had required soldiers to reenlist, not extend, within this timeframe.

Recruiting was not as successful in the reserve components. The ARNG sought 42,957 enlistees but only enlisted 34,658 people. The USAR sought 15,875 enlistees and enlisted only 11,690 people. The reserve components faced the same recruiting challenges as the RA, but increased operational tempo, particularly in the ARNG, exacerbated recruiting struggles. Both components,  however,  exceeded  their  retention  objectives  for  the  fiscal year. The ARNG had 36,628 soldiers reenlist versus a goal of 33,624. The USAR had 12,528 soldiers reenlist versus a goal of 11,000.

Racial demographics across the enlisted ranks were similar to previous fiscal years ( Table 10 ).

In  the  RA,  29  percent  of  junior  enlisted  personnel  and  72  percent of NCOs were married. Twenty-seven percent of junior enlisted soldiers and 73 percent of NCOs had children. In the ARNG, 14 percent of junior enlisted soldiers and 56 percent of NCOs were married. Sixteen percent of junior enlisted and 56 percent of NCOs had children. In the USAR,

U.S. Army  Human  Resources  Command  transitioned  to  a  new computer model to produce military occupational specialty (MOS) and rank  strength  projections.  The  Inventory  Projection  Assistance  System replaced  the  HQDA  G-1's  Enlisted  Specialty  Model  and  its  Analyst Projection  System.  These  older  models  had  been  in  use  for  more  than twenty years. The Inventory Projection Assistance System is an adjustable model that will be updated on a monthly basis. It will incorporate the NCO evaluation boards' order of merit lists for promotions to the ranks of E-6 through E-8, which will allow the Army to optimize enlisted personnel distribution across the operational force.

In  FY  2021,  U.S.  Army  Human  Resources  Command  used  the Assignment  Satisfaction  Key-Enlisted  Module  (ASK-EM)  platform  to serve as an interim enlisted marketplace across all MOSs for staff sergeant, sergeant first class, and master sergeant requirements until the permanent marketplace in the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) is fielded. This measure gives mid- to late-career NCOs a greater voice in their assignments and provides increased stability and predictability in the assignment process by moving away from a weekly assessment cycle. ASKEM began with five cycles per year but moved to four to provide soldiers an eight-week open market window.

After  full  implementation,  ASK-EM  directed  staff  sergeants  and above to list their top three preferred assignments each in the continental United States  and  overseas.  The  system  then  matched  these  preferences

against readiness requirements and input the preferences into an enlisted assignment cycle. Talent managers could then balance these preferences with operational needs. Between 1,000 and 1,300 soldiers in the infantry career  management  field  entered  the  ASK-EM  market  with  more  than 80 percent receiving one of their top five assignment preferences. ASKEM also placed more than 4,400 field artillery, 2,800 air defense artillery, and 1,400 armor soldiers in units. Additionally, talent managers completed out-of-cycle  assignments  to  ensure  soldiers  matched  critical  one-deep assignments, such as with AFC and U.S. Army Cadet Command.

The  Army  in  FY  2021  announced  new  policies  regarding  NCO promotions.  Promotions  to  the  rank  of  corporal  are  no  longer  tied  to utilization  or  an  assigned  position.  Instead,  only  soldiers  who  were recommended for eventual promotion to the rank of sergeant and who had graduated from the Basic Leader Course could wear corporal rank. This would serve as a visual confirmation that the soldier had transitioned from the junior enlisted ranks to the NCO corps. The Army also authorized the implementation of temporary promotions for soldiers unable to complete required professional military education because of deployments, pregnancy,  or  attendance  at  the  nonresident  Sergeants  Major  Course. Temporary promotions would terminate on a specific date if the soldier did not complete the required educational course.

The  service  conducted  a  prototype  of  the  Sergeant  Major  Assessment Program  with  twenty-eight  recent  U.S.  Army  Sergeants  Major  Academy graduates. Modeled  on  the  Battalion  Command  Assessment  Program, the  Sergeant  Major  Assessment  Program  assessed  these  senior  NCOs  in several  ways:  cognitive  and  noncognitive,  written  communication,  verbal communication,  peer  and  subordinate  feedback,  and  physical  fitness.  A psychologist interviewed them, and each also participated in a double-blind panel  interview  with  nominative  command  sergeants  major  and  senior commissioned  officers.  The  Army  will  use  the  results  of  the  prototype  to develop and refine the final version of the Sergeant Major Assessment Program.

The  Army  instituted  several  MOS  revisions  in  FY  2021.  The  first series  of  revisions  pertained  to  Career  Management  Field  25  (Signal). Changes included the deletions  of  MOSs  25M  (Multimedia  Illustrator), 25P (Microwave Systems Operator-Maintainer), 25T (Satellite/Microwave Systems Chief), and 25C (Radio Operator-Maintainer). The job functions of  these  MOSs  transferred  to  MOSs  25V  (Combat  Documentation/ Production Specialist), 25S (Satellite Communication Systems Operator-Maintainer), 25U  (Signal Support System Specialist), and 25W (Telecommunications  Operations  Chief),  respectively.  The  second revision transferred all MOS 92L (Petroleum Laboratory Specialist) duties, functions, positions, and soldiers in grades E-6 through E-7 to MOS 92F (Petroleum  Supply  Specialist).  Finally,  the  Army  eliminated  MOS  09L (Translator/Interpreter).  The  service  had  created  this  MOS  in  2003  for Arabic, Dari, and Pashto native and heritage speakers to support operations in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq.  All  soldiers  serving  in  MOS  09L  had  until 30 April 2022 to reclassify to a new specialty.

## Civilian Personnel

At the end of FY 2021, the Army had 296,462 appropriated fund civilian employees and 23,368 nonappropriated fund employees ( Table 11 ). During FY 2021, minorities accounted for 34 percent of the civilian workforce, veterans 50 percent, women 38 percent, and disabled people 12 percent. The median age of Army civilian employees was 49.

Time-to-hire remained a significant issue in FY 2021. The Office of Personnel Management set a benchmark of eighty days for civilian hiring in the federal government. In previous fiscal years, the Army exceeded this mark. In FY 2021, the Army's time-to-hire for all positions, competitive and noncompetitive, fluctuated from a high of ninety-four days to a low of seventy-eight days. The average for the fiscal year was eighty-six days, which represented a three-day increase from FY 2020. The length of the review  process  and  long  initial  security  investigations  caused  repeated challenges  in  reducing  the  overall  time-to-hire.  Increased  use  of  direct

hire authorities, though, is expected to reduce time-to-hire in the future and assist commands with their efforts to streamline hiring for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics positions.

As part of the implementation plan within The Army People Strategy , the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, highlighted the value of hiring military  spouses  as  Army  civilian  employees.  Additionally,  the  office  set out  to  improve  employment  data  collection,  modify  hiring  authorities to  improve  accessibility,  and  maximize  the  use  of  technology  to  deliver employment and relocation information through mobile applications and an improved website. It expanded the role of the Army in DoD's Military Spouse Employment Partnership program, provided support to Army Employment Readiness  Program  professionals,  and  developed  an  employment  guide covering federal employment with information specific to military spouses.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1,  continued  working on  a  service-wide  reassessment  program  that  began  in  FY  2020.  The program  would  allow  current  eligible  appropriated  fund  employees  to be  noncompetitively  placed  into  vacant  positions  across  commands. This  would  address  a  recruitment  capability  gap  for  appropriated  fund employees  by  providing  a  mechanism  for  hiring  internal  candidates in  an  expedited  manner.  In  FY  2021,  the  program  received  funding  for the development of an automated system that will operate the program. Initiation of the program is expected in FY 2022.

## Fort Hood Independent Review

Spc.  Vanessa  Guillén,  a  soldier  assigned  to  the  3d  Cavalry  Regiment  at Fort Hood, went missing on 22 April 2020. A fellow soldier had murdered

her on that day. Then the murderer and an accomplice removed Specialist Guillén's body from Fort Hood, dismembered it, and buried the remains. On  30  June,  workers  discovered  partial  human  remains  near  the  Leon River.  The  murderer  killed  himself  on  1  July  when  confronted  by  law enforcement officers. On 5 July, authorities confirmed the remains as those of Specialist Guillén. Her family, Hispanic advocacy groups, and members of Congress voiced concerns that commanders at Fort Hood had failed to provide a safe and inclusive environment. In response, later in FY 2020, the secretary of the Army established the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee  to  determine  whether  the  command  climate  and  culture  at Fort Hood and in the surrounding community reflected the Army's values.

In December 2020, the committee released its report with nine findings and seventy recommendations. The committee found that implementation of  the  Sexual  Harassment/Assault  Response  and  Prevention  (SHARP) program at Fort Hood was ineffective. No general officers or subordinate echelon  commander  at  Fort  Hood  had  intervened  or  made  mitigation efforts  when  risks  of  high  crime,  sexual  assault,  and  sexual  harassment became  apparent.  This  inaction  had  produced  on  the  post  a  lack  of confidence in the SHARP program and a lack of knowledge concerning reporting processes and victim advocacy services. The committee further determined that officials had failed to identify or address serious crime issues  both  on  Fort  Hood  and  in  the  surrounding  communities.  This failure included chronic understaffing and a lack of experience in the Fort Hood Criminal Investigation Command field office. Based on the review's findings,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  directed  the  relief  or  suspension  of fourteen  Fort  Hood  leaders,  from  the  major  general  level  down  to  the squad level.

The committee's report led the Army to institute a new policy on missing soldiers. It directed commanders to change the duty status of a soldier who is absent from the place of duty to 'absent-unknown' within three hours of discovering that the soldier is missing. A soldier can remain in this status for up to forty-eight hours. During that time, unit leaders and Army law enforcement  officials  must  make  every  effort  to  locate  the  soldier.  Unit commanders or their representatives also are required to notify the nextof-kin within eight hours of discovering the soldier's absence. Meanwhile, the local Directorate of Emergency Services creates a blotter entry, submits a law enforcement report, and issues a be-on-the-lookout report into the Army Law Enforcement Reporting and Tracking System. If the soldier is not located within forty-eight hours, then commanders must determine if the soldier's absence is voluntary or involuntary. If, based on evidence, a commander concludes that the absence is voluntary, then the soldier's duty status is changed to 'absent without leave. ' If, by contrast, the absence was involuntary, then the soldier is reported as missing and classified as a 'duty

status-whereabouts unknown' casualty. The Army subsequently begins operations to locate the missing soldier.

## People First

The  secretary  of  the  Army  established  the  People  First  Task  Force  in December 2020 to analyze the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee's recommendations and develop a plan based on the recommendations. The subsequent plan revised Army policies, processes, and programs to improve the service's ability to build diverse, adaptive, and cohesive teams. The task force served as the HQDA-wide integrator for the plan's implementation. The  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-1;  the  assistant  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-2; and the sergeant major from the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-2, are  the  task  force's  chairs.  At  the  end  of  FY  2021,  the  task  force  had  60 people assigned to it. It was organized along four primary lines of effortprevention, accountability, response, and climate and culture-along with two separate staff sections, one specifically focused on implementing the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee's recommendations and the other on redesigning the SHARP program.

The People First Task Force hosted a People First Solarium from 15 to 19 March 2021. The solarium's purpose was to provide Army senior leaders with insights from junior enlisted soldiers and company grade officers into the state of trust between soldiers and leadership, the perceived causes of harmful behavior, and recommended solutions. During the solarium, 100 soldiers  and  officers  gathered  at  the  United  States  Military  Academy  to discuss sexual harassment and assault, suicide, extremism, and racism. The solarium culminated in a final discussion with the senior official performing the duties of the undersecretary of the Army, the vice chief of staff of the Army,  and  the  sergeant  major  of  the  Army.  Proposals  for  improvement included establishing a method to measure the level of cohesion and trust in a unit, the creation of a mobile application-based anonymous reporting system,  and  the  potential  to  add  block  time  for  behavioral  health  and wellness training along the lines of existing physical fitness training blocks.

In February 2021, the secretary of defense established an Independent Review  Commission  on  Sexual  Assault  in  the  Military  to  assess  the military's current treatment of sexual assault and sexual harassment cases. The commission made eighty-two recommendations across four lines of effort: accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and victim care and support. In response, HQDA deployed three observation teams to examine the  service's  SHARP  efforts  in  its  organizations.  The  teams  observed numerous inconsistencies and misunderstandings of SHARP terminology. A  lack  of  a  dedicated  prevention  workforce  and  compliance  challenges exacerbated problems with the program.

The  People  First  Task  Force  prepared  an  Army  directive,  published in  May  2021,  on  immediate  actions  to  improve  the  SHARP  program. These actions drew on the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee's recommendations and were aligned with the four lines of effort set out by the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military. Among the actions given  in  the  directive  is  the  requirement  for  sexual harassment investigating officers to come from outside the complainant's brigade.  It  also  directed  the  establishment  of  military  protective  orders within  six  hours  of  a  brigade-level  commander  determining  one  is necessary. Brigade commanders now are required to inform sexual assault victims within two business days of case resolution by judicial, nonjudicial, or administrative action. Another Army directive, published in September 2021,  authorized  an  unrestricted  reporting  option  and  victim  advocacy services for Army civilians who report a sexual assault. In September 2021, the secretary of the Army directed the People First Task Force to develop an Integrated Prevention Strategy. The strategy will give the service a better way to prevent sexual assault and other harmful behaviors by setting the conditions for how the Army institutionalizes prevention in policies and programs. Publication of the strategy is expected in early FY 2023.

The  SHARP  Academy  trained  258  students  in  the  Career  Course, Trainer  Course,  and  Program  Managers  Course  in  FY  2021.  It  also supported 145 SHARP Foundation Courses that trained 3,606 soldiers and  civilians  across  the  Army.  The  academy  collaborated  with  the Center for Initial Military Training and the Noncommissioned Officer Leadership  Center  of  Excellence  to  assess  the  Basic  Officer  Leader Course  and  the  Basic  Leader  Course  against  DoD-published  junior leader knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment. Based on this assessment, the three organizations will revise lesson content in the courses to prepare second lieutenants and sergeants better  for  the  leadership  challenges  associated  with  sexual  assault  and harassment cases.

In  2020,  the  HQDA  G-1  commissioned  the  RAND  Arroyo  Center to study sexual harassment in the RA. The center delivered its report in FY  2021.  The  study  found  that  the  most  serious  experiences  of  sexual harassment for women were repeated attempts to establish an unwanted intimate  or  sexual  relationship;  being  ignored  on  the  basis  of  gender; sexist  comments  about  women's  abilities  to  do  their  jobs;  and  sexual comments  about  their  appearance  or  body.  For  men,  the  most  serious experiences of sexual harassment were insults about their masculinity or sexual orientation. Women experienced significantly more types of sexual harassment  or  gender  discrimination  than  men.  Forty-eight  percent  of women  indicated  that  at  least  one  of  the  perpetrators  was  either  their supervisor or someone in their chain of command. Regardless of whether

victims were men or women, sexual harassment and gender discrimination were primarily committed by male soldiers.

The People First Task Force began a cohesion assessment team pilot program in April 2021. The teams provide commanders an assessment of the degree of trust and cohesion within the unit as opposed to a compliancebased inspection or staff assistance visit. Teams include experienced leaders, chaplains, lawyers, senior NCOs, organizational behavior experts, SHARP program personnel, research psychologists, and various specialists to help interpret, analyze, and synthesize data. Before the team's arrival, soldiers in the participating unit take a survey about the climate, leadership, and harmful behaviors in the unit. At the same time, participating units send the team a wide range of historical data about the unit. The team spends approximately five days with the unit. During that time, they have informal and formal interactions with soldiers to assess group dynamics. At the end of the assessment, team members present an out brief of their observations, facilitate  a  discussion  with  the  unit's  leadership  about  the  results,  and provide information about available resources to address issues raised by the assessment. The task force conducted four team visits in FY 2021 at Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Carson, Colorado; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; and in Korea. Assessments are scheduled for Fort Hood and Fort Bliss, Texas, in early FY 2022.

Improving quality of life for soldiers and civilians is another aspect of the People First priority. The secretary of the Army chartered the Quality of Life Task Force in March 2020. The task force, led by HQDA 's deputy chief of staff, G-9, developed a campaign plan, nested within The Army People  Strategy ,  for  a  comprehensive  approach  to  strengthening  quality of life programs across the Army. The plan consists of six lines of effort, thirty-one  objectives,  and  222  tasks.  The  six  lines  of  effort  are  housing, health care, childcare, spouse employment, permanent change of station moves, and bolstering facilities and programs at remote installations with critical  quality  of  life  needs.  In  FY  2021,  the  task  force  completed  eight objectives and 105 tasks in the campaign plan.

In FY 2021, the service implemented the transition assistance program requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. In the program, counselors provide services to soldiers preparing for the transition to civilian life. The Quality of Life Directorate in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) additionally worked on reducing processing time for childcare suitability background  checks  and  supported  hiring  surges  for  childcare  workers. The directorate also addressed Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) funding shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The HQDA G-1's Army Resilience Directorate completed the Suicide Prevention and Resilience Strengthening Pilot. The pilot aimed to increase

soldier resilience and to reduce suicide-related behaviors, suicide deaths, and  psychological  health  problems.  The  initial  assessment  of  the  pilot determined  that  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  test  and control groups with regard to mental disorders, suicidal ideation, suicide plan-making, or alcohol misuse.

The Army Resilience Directorate, in FY 2021, fielded the Ask, Care, Escort Suicide Intervention training course to replace the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills training course. It also fielded new suicide prevention awareness materials starting in January 2021. The 'This is Our Army: Not Every Fight is on the Battlefield' campaign places greater emphasis on and provides information about recognizing warning signs, intervening, and encouraging help-seeking behaviors. A revised regulation and pamphlet regarding suicide prevention are scheduled for publication in the second quarter of FY 2022.

In FY 2021, 176 members of the RA, 119 members of the ARNG, and 41 members of the USAR committed suicide. Compared to FY 2020, this was an increase of 3 in the RA, 39 in the ARNG, and 1 in the USAR.

The Commander's Risk Reduction Toolkit, formerly the Commander's Risk Reduction Dashboard, is a web-based tool for displaying soldier and unit  risk  to  commanders and senior NCOs. It includes data from more than twenty sources addressing almost forty risk and protective factors. At the company and battalion echelons, the toolkit provides a consolidated history  of  the  personal  information  for  each  soldier  in  the  unit.  This information is designed to help facilitate the development of intervention and prevention strategies and ensure soldiers receive the assistance they need. At brigade and higher echelons, the toolkit presents aggregated risk data for subordinate elements to enable the analysis of trends and event relationships. Fielding of the toolkit to the RA began in June 2020, and to  the  ARNG and the USAR in December 2020. In April 2021, HQDA published a directive that prescribed use of the toolkit, established access requirements to it, and identified sources to be aggregated into its database.

## Inclusion

In  June  2020,  the  Army  announced  the  start  of  Project  Inclusion.  The project's  purpose  is  to  implement  programs  and  policies  to  achieve  the objectives and goals set out in The Army People Strategy: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Annex . The Army Equity and Inclusion Agency is responsible for finalizing plans and tracking systems for tasks outlined in the annex. The  agency  hosted  'Your  Voice  Matters'  listening  sessions  and  heard from more than 7,500 soldiers and civilians through 155 sessions across 23 installations. These sessions provided insights into policies, practices, and  regulations  that  reduce  quality  of  life  and  might  disparately  affect

personnel. The agency then produced an outreach and engagement plan to provide senior leaders with a framework for targeting strategic engagement opportunities in support of The Army People Strategy .

In May 2021, the service issued modifications to its appearance and grooming  standards  in  response  to  criticisms  that  the  current  policies failed to accommodate the different and unique physical characteristics of  all  soldiers.  The  changes  are  intended  to  offer  soldiers  options  for grooming and appearance that take into account professional presence, health  and  wellness,  good  order  and  discipline,  functionality,  diversity, and inclusion. The Army conducted a panel consisting of a diverse group of soldiers from all three components in order to ascertain the best policies to meet this objective.

The  major  changes  included  eliminating  the  hair  length  limit  for female soldiers and allowing female soldiers to wear ponytails, two braids, or a singular braid in all uniforms. All soldiers are allowed to wear natural highlights  in  their  hair.  All  soldiers  can  wear  clear  nail  polish  while  in uniform,  and  women  can  wear  nonextreme  nail  polish  colors.  Female

soldiers are also allowed to wear nonextreme shades of lipstick and stud earrings while in the Army Combat Uniform.

In  June  2021,  an  Army  directive  revised  the  service's  policy  on transgender  people  and  people  with  gender  dysphoria.  This  directive superseded all previous guidance regarding transgender service members. The  directive  stated  that  the  Army  is  open  to  all  who  can  meet  the standards  for  military  service  and  readiness.  Among  its  provisions,  the directive  required  that  no  otherwise  qualified  soldier  be  involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service, or otherwise subjected to adverse action or treatment, solely on the basis of gender identity. For policies and standards that apply differently to soldiers according to gender, the Army recognizes a soldier's gender by the soldier's gender  marker  in  the  Defense  Enrollment  Eligibility  Reporting  System. In accordance with that gender marker, soldiers are expected to meet all standards  for  uniforms  and  grooming,  body  composition  assessment, physical readiness testing, and other military standards. Soldiers diagnosed with gender dysphoria will receive all medically necessary treatment for gender transition, obtain a gender marker change in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility  Reporting  System,  and  serve  according  to  the  standards  and expectations established for that gender marker. No later than 1 April 2023, the inspector general will provide the secretary of the Army with a report of inspection on the Army's compliance with this directive.

## Special Topics

In  April  2021,  the  service  published  a  revision  of  Army  Regulation 600-8-2, Suspension  of  Favorable  Personnel  Actions  (Flag) .  Among  the changes was one mandated by a new DoD policy designating all military positions as national security positions regardless of their required security clearance level or a soldier's need for access to classified information in a position. Now, all military personnel must have, at a minimum, a favorable outcome from either a National Agency Check with Local Agency Check and Credit investigation or a Tier 3 background investigation. Units now need to flag soldiers who do not meet this criteria. At the end of FY 2021, more than 105,000 soldiers were not yet in compliance.

The IPPS-A is a web-based human resource platform that supports total force visibility, talent management, and auditability. IPPS-A Release 1 began in FY 2015 and continued through the end of FY 2018. It interfaced with fifteen separate pay systems used across the Army and built the foundational database  of  personnel  data  for  future  releases.  In  FY  2020,  the  Army completed the fielding of IPPS-A Release 2, which had begun in FY 2019. This  release  collapsed  separate  ARNG  pay  systems  into  a  single  system and provided mobile self-service capability to national guard soldiers. The

Army had scheduled Release 3, which provides human resources and pay capability to all three components, for fielding in FY 2021. Stress testing of Release 3, however, revealed interface and data-integration problems. The final test phase of the release is now scheduled for June 2022.

In  March  2021,  the  Army  moved  the  web  portal  for  its  tuition assistance program from the GoArmyEd system to a new platform called ArmyIgnitED. The new platform simplifies  access  to  education  benefits for soldiers and civilian employees. After closing the GoArmyEd system, however, problems arose with ArmyIgnitED, which prevented its launch on  the  planned  date.  Transferring  fifteen  years'  worth  of  data  between the two systems proved to be far more difficult than expected. The delay prevented many people from receiving their tuition assistance. Some could not enroll in their desired courses, and others paid the fees with their own funds. In July, ArmyIgnitED opened.

## Army Review Boards Agency

The Army Review Boards Agency continued to focus on eliminating the Army Board of Corrections for Military Records case backlog that had exceeded congressionally mandated standards of timeliness. The agency employed several IT platforms to shorten case adjudication timelines and increased the number of board meetings from four to seven. It temporarily increased  medical  office  staffing,  which  allowed  for  the  review  of  more than 2,910 medical case opinions for inclusion in the board's records of proceedings. This reduced medical backlogs by 81 percent.

In  April  2021,  a  federal  court  approved  a  settlement  in  a  lawsuit that alleged the Army had wrongly discharged troops who engaged in misconduct but whose behavior may have been caused by posttraumatic stress  disorder,  traumatic  brain  injury,  sexual  trauma  that  occurred during their service, or other behavioral health conditions. This settlement covers veterans from all three components. The service agreed to  automatically  reconsider  certain  discharge-status-upgrade  decisions made  by  the  Army  Discharge  Review  Board  since  17  April  2011  that partially or fully denied relief to veterans with less-than-fully-honorable discharges. The settlement also expands reapplication rights for eligible applicants who were discharged and received an adverse Army Discharge Review  Board  decision  between  7  October  2001  and  16  April  2011. Additionally, the service will permit applicants to appear telephonically before  the  Army  Discharge  Review  Board,  implement  more  training for board members, and update protocols for decision making in cases involving symptoms or diagnoses of behavioral health conditions. The board is required to update the court every six months on the number of cases it has reconsidered and decided.

## Medal of Honor

Col. Ralph Puckett Jr. received the Medal of Honor on 21 May 2021 for his actions during the Korean War. Then-Lieutenant Puckett volunteered in 1950 for service with the new Eighth Army Ranger Company. Selected to be its commander, Puckett trained the company and led it into combat. On 25 November 1950, the unit attacked and secured Hill 205 near the Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River, about 60 miles from the Chinese border. The company, assisted  by  indirect  fire  support,  then  held  the  hill  against  five  Chinese counterattacks for more than four hours despite being outnumbered ten to one. Puckett was wounded twice as he moved about the hill coordinating the  defense  and  inspiring  his  men.  In  the  early  morning  hours  of 26 November, the Chinese attacked for a sixth time. Supporting fires were now  unavailable,  and  the  enemy  overran  the  company.  Close-quarters fighting ensued, and Puckett suffered additional debilitating wounds when a mortar round exploded near him. He ordered his men to abandon him and  save  themselves,  but  several  instead  fought  to  his  side  and  carried him to safety at the bottom of the hill. For his actions on Hill 205, Puckett initially received the Distinguished Service Cross.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Force development is the process of determining Army doctrine, leader development,  training,  organization,  soldier  development,  and  materiel requirements and translating them into programs and structures within allocated resources  to  accomplish  Army  missions  and  functions.  It supports Army Campaign Plan objectives through preparation of doctrine, modernization of equipment, and training programs.

During  FY  2021,  the  service  continued  to  implement  the  ' Army Vision'  and The  Army  Strategy published  in  October  2018.  The  Army Vision stated that the Army of 2028 will be ready to deploy, fight, and win decisively against any adversary, anytime and anywhere, in a joint, multidomain,  high-intensity  conflict,  while  simultaneously  deterring others and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare. The Army Strategy articulated how the service would achieve this vision over the next  ten  years.  It  stated  the  Army's  central  challenge  was  using  finite resources  to  remain  ready  to  fight  while  simultaneously  modernizing and preparing for a fundamentally different future. The strategy set forth a  phased  approach  focused  on  readiness,  modernization,  institutional reform, and maintaining alliances and partnerships. Underpinning this strategic approach was an enduring commitment to taking care of the Army's people and upholding the Army's values.

## Readiness

In May 2020, the Army's senior leaders approved the Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model (ReARMM) for planning purposes. The service announced it in October 2020 and published an execute order for the model in November 2020. The model provides greater certainty for training, logistical requirements, and personnel management in all three components with a force generation process that creates a regionally and functionally aligned Army. A key component of the model is establishing predictable windows for units to field the modern capabilities necessary to build a multidomain-capable Army. Unit life cycles in ReARMM contain standardized phases for modernization, training, and mission availability. This gives unit commanders a framework for long-term planning. At the same time,  the  Army  must  continue  to  provide  a  predictable  supply  of ready units to the joint force. Mission lines are the primary mechanism for ensuring regional alignment. They describe both Global Force Management

Allocation Plan and Directed Readiness Table requirements, aligning units to  the  requirement across the Future Years Defense Program. The same units  will  remain  on  a  mission  line  across  multiple  iterations,  building individual  and  organizational  understanding  of  a  region's  operational environment.  Throughout  FY  2021,  the  Army  continued  to  develop, test,  and  rehearse  the  ReARMM  process  in  the  RA  and  in  the  reserve components. It will achieve initial operating capacity early in FY 2022 and full operating capability early in FY 2024.

The readiness of the Army's brigade combat teams (BCTs) declined during FY 2021. In October 2020, half of the Army's fifty-eight RA and ARNG  BCTs  were  at  their  highest  levels  of  readiness.  By  May  2021, the number of BCTs reported at the highest levels of readiness stood at eighteen-all  in  the  RA.  Eight  of  the  Army's  eleven  combat  aviation brigades were at the highest readiness level.

## Doctrine and Future Force

In  March  2021,  HQDA  published  Chief  of  Staff  Paper  #1, Army MultiDomain Transformation: Ready to Win in Competition and Conflict ,  and Chief of Staff Paper #2, The Army in Military Competition .  These papers, together  with  AFC  Pamphlet  525-2, Future  Operational  Environment: Forging  the  Future  in  an  Uncertain  World,  2035-2050 , published  in November  2020,  describe  how  and  why  the  Army  plans  to  transform itself by 2035 to become a multidomain-capable force able to dominate its near-peer adversaries in a future of persistent competition. The concepts developed in these documents are to be incorporated into a revision of Field Manual 3-0, Operations , that is expected to be approved by June 2022.

Army  Multi-Domain  Transformation:  Ready  to  Win  in  Competition and Conflict continued to articulate the Army's multidomain operations concept,  first  published  in  2018.  The  paper  summarizes  the  emerging military challenges posed by America's near-peer adversaries, characterized  by  antiaccess and  area-denial  capabilities designed  to prevent  the  United  States  from  projecting  power.  By  2035,  the  service's multidomain transformation will provide the joint force with additional means to counter these threats. The transformation will produce units that can project power across land, air, maritime, space, and cyber domains. The paper also provided a description of multidomain operations across all three phases of the Army's new operational framework-competition, crisis, and conflict.

The  Army  in  Military  Competition defines  the  concept  of  military competition, identified as a reemerging threat in the 2018 National Defense Strategy , more  clearly  for  the  Army.  The  paper  stressed  that  military competition, formerly referred to as phase zero or peace, is an ongoing,

The Army Multi-Domain Operations Concept

<!-- image -->

'infinite  game, '  falling  short  of  armed  conflict,  that  is  conducted  in  an interconnected world where actions reverberate globally with American adversaries  and  partners  alike.  The  chief  of  staff  noted  that  winning  in competition could take many forms, such as deterring conflict, upholding American interests, supporting allies, or preparing for armed conflict, but cautioned that wins today serve as openings for future competition. The paper also outlined the three dynamics of military competition-narrative, direct, and indirect-which are distinguished by their differing objectives, methods, and scope. The three dynamics provide a means to understand what kinds of capabilities are most useful within a specific context.

Future Operational Environment: Forging the Future in an Uncertain World,  2035-2050 sought  to  help  the  service's  leaders  think  about  the nature of future operations and how they might influence Army concepts, technology,  material,  and  training.  The  pamphlet  did  not  try  to  predict what will happen, but rather explored four scenarios of what could happen. The goal was to help the Army 'see the future as clearly as possible' and to use that vision as part of a baseline for thinking and decision making about the future Army.

The  Army  also  published  an  unclassified  version  of  Chief  of  Staff Paper  #3, Regaining  Arctic  Dominance , in  March  2021.  This  paper explained how the service will generate, train, organize, and equip its forces to  partner  with  allies,  secure  national  interests,  and  maintain  regional stability in Arctic areas. It committed the Army to field a multidomain, task force-enabled division in the Arctic region and adjust its Alaskabased  BCTs  to  improve  their  capabilities  under  Arctic  conditions. Regaining dominance in the Arctic also will provide new opportunities

to  engage  with  America's  allies  and  partners  who  operate  in  extreme cold  weather  and  in  mountainous  and  high-altitude  environments.  In accordance with the objectives set out in the paper, units participated in several exercises in Alaska during FY 2021, including Arctic W arrior 21 and Northern Edge 21, in order to test the Army's new Arctic concepts and identify capability gaps.

AFC  Pamphlet  71-20-7, Army  Futures Command  Concept  for Protection,  2028 , published  in  April  2021,  described  the  capabilities required  for  Army  formations  to  survive  and  conduct  multidomain operations on future battlefields. The concept reframed the Army protection warfighting function as a dynamic, anticipatory, and proactive mission to protect against threats in all domains, the electromagnetic spectrum, and information environment. The purpose is to preserve commanders' forces, deny  the  enemy  freedom  of  action,  and  enable  windows  of  superiority against  enemy  formations.  The  pamphlet  serves  as  a  guide  for  future force development and modernization. It superseded U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Pamphlet 525-3-5, The U.S. Army Functional Concept  for Maneuver  Support,  2020-2040 , published  in February 2017.

AFC Pamphlet 71-20-8, Army Futures Command Concept for Cyberspace  and  Electromagnetic  Operations,  2028 , published  in  June  2021,

described how the Army will operate in cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum and how it will fully integrate cyber, electromagnetic, and information  operations  in  a  synchronized  system  to  support  multidomain operations. The pamphlet serves as a conceptual framework for the continual  development  of  Army  capabilities  in  these  rapidly  changing fields. It superseded  TRADOC  Pamphlet  525-8-6, The  U.S.  Army Concept for Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations , published in January 2018.

AFC  Pamphlet  71-20-9, Army  Futures  Command  Concept  for Command and Control  2028:  Pursuing  Decision  Dominance ,  released in  July  2021,  was  a  major  revision  of  TRADOC  Pamphlet  525-3-3, The U.S. Army Functional Concept for Mission Command , published in February 2017. The new concept identified the command and control capabilities necessary for the success of future multidomain operations in  complex,  highly  competitive,  lethal,  and  hyperactive  operational environments  against  near-peer  adversaries.  It  nested  within  the Army's  emerging  concepts  for  multidomain  operations  at  echelons above  brigade.  It  envisioned  future  command  and  control  systems that use human expertise and advanced technology to rapidly receive and analyze information and enable commanders to make timely and informed  decisions  that  are  quickly  disseminated  to  subordinates  in easily understandable formats.

AFC launched Project Convergence in 2020 as the service's campaign of learning to ensure that Army forces, as part of the joint force, can rapidly and continuously integrate or 'converge' effects across all domains-air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace-to overmatch adversaries both in competition and in conflict. During FY 2021, the command analyzed the results of Project Convergence 2020 and prepared for the October-November 2021 iteration of  Project  Convergence.  The  U.S.  Army  Joint  Modernization  Command, headquartered at Fort Bliss, Texas, is the lead for Project Convergence 2021. The  2021  iteration  of  Project  Convergence  will  expand  beyond  tactical Army-specific  efforts  to  focus  on  large-scale  joint  demonstrations  and experiments  involving  the  other  services.  Army  units,  including  the  82d Airborne Division and the Army's new multidomain task force formations, are scheduled to participate in events at multiple, widely dispersed locations, including Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona; White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; and Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

In November 2019, the secretary of defense designated the secretary of the Army as the DoD executive agent for counter-small unmanned aircraft systems. The secretary of the Army then established the Joint CounterSmall Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office. In FY 2021, DoD published Counter-Small  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems  Strategy . The  strategy  has three lines of effort: ready the force, defend the force, and build the team.

To ready the force, DoD will maximize current counter-small unmanned aircraft systems capabilities and use a risk-based approach to guide rapid development of a suite of materiel and nonmaterial solutions to address emerging  requirements.  To  defend  the  force,  DoD  will  coordinate the  fielding  of  joint  capabilities  and  synchronize  the  development  of operational concepts and doctrine. To build the team, DoD will partner with  other  federal  agencies,  industries,  and  other  nations  to  facilitate rapid development and deployment of counter-small unmanned aircraft systems solutions while maximizing interoperability.

## Force Structure

The total number of BCTs remained constant at fifty-eight, with thirty-one in the RA and twenty-seven in the ARNG. The mix of BCTs in the RA was eleven armored, thirteen infantry, and seven Stryker. The types of BCTs in the ARNG stood at five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker.

The  Army  continued  to  increase  its  capabilities  at  echelons  above brigade  in  order  to  prepare  for  large-scale  combat  against  near-peer adversaries. The Army's Multi-Domain Transformation strategy identified multidomain-capable formations at every echelon as key to command and control during future conflicts. Army leaders identified the years 20282030 as the waypoint for the initial implementation of major force structure changes on the path to a fully multidomain-capable Army of 2035.

On 16 October 2020, the Army reactivated the V Corps headquarters at  Fort  Knox,  Kentucky,  as  part  of  its  effort  to  prepare  for  large-scale combat against near-peer adversaries. Approximately 200 of the unit's 635 soldiers began operating from a forward command post in Poland on a rotational basis beginning in FY 2021. This provided a much-needed level of command and control for the U.S. Army and allied- and partner-nation tactical formations operating in Europe. The corps completed command post exercises in March and June 2021 as it worked toward reaching full operational capacity.

During  FY  2021,  the  Army  began  designing  new  formations  for divisions to improve their capability for large-scale, multidomain operations. This would make the division the Army's decisive unit of action, as opposed to the BCT. Divisions are likely to see the return of a division cavalry squadron as well as organic cyber, electronic warfare, field artillery, and air  defense  capabilities.  During  FY  2021,  the  Army  revealed  a  new formation, the penetration division. Intended to specialize in breaching enemy defensive lines, it will have more engineer, bridging, artillery, and maneuver capabilities than the typical heavy division. New force structure designs for heavy, light, airborne, and air assault divisions are expected to appear in October 2021.

Efforts continued during FY 2021 to reinvigorate artillery formations for use in  large-scale,  multidomain operations against near-peer adversaries. At the theater level, the service continued to field multidomain task forces designed  to  deliver  and  coordinate  long-range  fires  and  attacks  against enemy  antiaccess  and  area  denial  capabilities.  Headquarters,  1st  MultiDomain Task Force, provisionally established in FY 2017 at Fort Lewis, Washington,  to  test  multidomain  concepts  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region, officially activated at the end of FY 2020. Headquarters, 2d Multi-Domain Task  Force,  activated  on  16  September  2021  in  Wiesbaden,  Germany. The Army remained committed to creating three more multidomain task forces in future years-one more focused on the Pacific, one focused on the Arctic region, and one for global response.

The Army also worked to establish a new theater fires command unit in Europe. This headquarters is intended to fill a gap at the theater-level Army  service  component  command,  which  lacks  the  staff  to  plan  and coordinate  long-range  fires.  The  56th  Artillery  Command  is  scheduled to activate as a two-star command at Mainz-Kastel, Germany, in October 2021. This activation, together with the 2d Multi-Domain Task Force, will add 500 soldiers to the Army's presence in Germany.

In  March 2021, the Army delivered training equipment to its first long-range, hypersonic battery to allow soldiers to train with the new systems, become familiar with long-range fires operations, and provide feedback for improvements. The battery is part of the 5th Battalion, 3d Field Artillery Regiment of the 17th Field Artillery Brigade, located at Fort Lewis, Washington. The Army's long-range, hypersonic weapon is intended to fly at speeds faster than Mach 5 and to maneuver in flight, making  it  more  difficult  to  detect.  The  battery  is  expected  to  be  fully operational in FY 2023.

The  Army  began  making  force  structure  changes  to  its  artillery formations at the corps and division levels during FY 2021. The existing rocket and missile systems assigned to the corps headquarters will receive new, longer-range munitions. The Army also announced that field artillery battalions  assigned  to  BCTs  will  be  shifted  to  the  control  of  division artillery headquarters by FY 2028. For the ARNG, this would necessitate reestablishing  division  artillery  headquarters.  The  first  of  eight  ARNG division  artillery  formations  was  activated  in  FY  2021.  In  the  RA,  the 2d  Infantry  Division's  artillery  headquarters  relocated  from  Fort  Lewis, Washington, to South Korea in September 2021.

Smaller  force  structure  reorganizations  affected  a  number  of  other branches during FY 2021. In January 2021, the U.S. Army Cyber Warfare Support Battalion 915 activated an additional company to provide cyberelectromagnetic  activity  support  to  Army  organizations  at  the  corps echelon and below. In April 2021, the 57th Signal Battalion was the second

signal unit converted to the new expeditionary signal battalion-enhanced structure. These formations operate smaller, more tailorable and scalable tactical  equipment  that  is  an  essential  component  of  the  multidomain operations concept. The expeditionary signal battalion-enhanced equipment  includes  the  new  medium  satellite  terminal  and  baseband kit-the  scalable  network  node-which  replaces  the  legacy  Warfighter Information Network-Tactical equipment.

The  82d  Finance  Battalion,  part  of  the  82d  Airborne  Division Sustainment Brigade at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, reactivated in May 2021.  Before  2007,  there  were  more  than  a  dozen  finance  battalions at various  installations,  but  these  were  inactivated  because  of  the requirements of counterinsurgency operations and replaced by financial management support units commanded by majors. The finance battalions are  led  by  lieutenant  colonels  and  provide  the  Army  with  finance organizations better suited to support large-scale combat operations. The service plans to reactivate several more finance battalions by the end of FY 2022.

On 30 September 2021, TRADOC eliminated two organizations, the U.S. Army Asymmetric Warfare Group and the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force, as the Army shifted its focus away from counterinsurgency operations to near-peer adversaries like Russia and China. The U.S. Army Asymmetric Warfare Group was originally organized in 2006 to focus on countering the threat of improvised explosives in Iraq. Its mission later expanded to helping the Army learn, adapt to, and disseminate the immediate lessons from combat. The Army established the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force in 2002 to supply soldiers with urgently needed equipment that could not be procured easily through normal acquisition channels.

## Training

During  FY  2021,  the  Army  reoriented  training  to  prioritize  individual expertise and collective training at the company level and below at home station in order to ensure that soldiers and their units were masters of their craft. These changes were part of the Army's new readiness model and were intended to provide the greatest returns on investments of limited time and resources. The Army continued to use combat training center rotations for large-scale collective training of battalions and brigades, but the purpose of home-station training was not to prepare for these rotations.

The Army also published an updated version of its capstone training manual, Field Manual 7-0, Training ,  in June 2021. The first update since 2016, it represented a transformation of the Army's approach to training as the service sought to prepare soldiers for large-scale combat after twenty years of mostly counterinsurgency warfare. The manual reintroduced the

Training Management Cycle. Rather than dictating training requirements for units, this tool permits unit leaders to set training priorities based on their own needs. Other goals of the revision were to foster leadership and strengthen unit cohesiveness by giving time back to small unit leaders. The new manual used clear and concise language so leaders and soldiers at all levels could understand and implement the doctrine.

The Army maintained COVID-19 protection measures for individual training put in place the previous fiscal year. One of the most important was the '2+8' model for basic combat training, in which recruits spent the first two weeks of the program in a controlled monitoring environment. The model continued to produce other benefits noted in FY 2020 by easing the transition from civilian to military life for recruits. In FY 2021, attrition rates at basic combat training dropped from 10.2 percent to 6.2 percent, and musculoskeletal injuries declined 15 percent for men and 10 percent for  women.  In  FY  2021,  U.S.  Army  Cadet  Command  resumed  cadet summer training at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Mitigation measures included quarantining  cadets  before  traveling  to  training,  regular  COVID-19 testing, and wearing masks.

The  service  continued  to  refine  the  Army  Combat  Fitness  Test  and its  associated  holistic  health  and  fitness  program  during  FY  2021.  The six-event Army Combat Fitness Test became the Army's physical fitness test  of  record on 1 October 2020, replacing the 40-year-old, three-event Army Physical Fitness Test. On 1 April 2021, the Army implemented two significant modifications to the Army Combat Fitness Test: the inclusion of the plank as a 100-point alternative to the leg tuck, as opposed to a 60point alternative, and the inclusion of an evaluation system with genderinformed  performance  categories.  The  Army  referred  to  these  changes as Army Combat Fitness Test 3.0. The service also continued to explore options to categorize performance based on gender.

## Operational Forces

During  FY  2021,  Army  units  engaged  in  a  variety  of  global  operations and security assistance missions with multiple foreign partners. In March 2021, the service supplied soldiers from all three components to combatant commanders in more than 140 countries. More than 69,000 soldiers were in  the  Indo-Pacific,  including  more  than  25,000  forward  deployed  in Korea. More than 30,000 soldiers were in Europe supporting NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the European Deterrence Initiative. The Army also continued to support counterterrorism and train, advise, and assist missions in the Central Command theater with more than 21,000 soldiers. Soldiers also assisted with disaster relief, border security missions, and the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Operational Forces: Afghanistan

On 29  February  2020,  the  United  States  signed  an  agreement  with  the Taliban to withdraw all American combat forces from Afghanistan. At the beginning of FY 2021, the major U.S. Army combat forces remaining in Afghanistan were elements of the 10th Mountain Division headquarters; the Combat Aviation Brigade, 4th Infantry Division; and the 2d BCT, 10th Mountain Division, as part of Operation Freedom's Sentinel. By January 2021, only 2,500 U.S. military personnel remained. By July, this number had  declined  to  about  650  personnel  to  protect  the  U.S.  embassy  and several hundred more to secure the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul until September 2021.

The security situation across Afghanistan rapidly deteriorated in July and  early  August  2021  as  Taliban  fighters  overran  government  forces. On 12 August, the DoD announced the deployment of 8,000 troops to Afghanistan to evacuate Americans and Afghans who had worked with the  U.S.  government.  Army  forces  that  deployed  included  the  1st  BCT, 82d  Airborne  Division,  and  elements  from  the  82d  Airborne  Division headquarters, the 44th Medical Brigade, the 16th Military Police Brigade, and  the  10th  Mountain  Division  from  Fort  Drum,  New  York.  The  1st Battalion,  194th Armored Regiment (Minnesota ARNG), which was on

a rotational deployment to Kuwait, also provided troops for this mission, as  did  a  small  contingent  from  3d  Battalion,  172d  Infantry  Regiment (Vermont ARNG).

American  forces  helped  evacuate  more  than  120,000  people  from Afghanistan. On 26 August, a suicide bomber killed one soldier, eleven marines, and one sailor at Hamid Karzai International Airport. Two other soldiers  were  wounded  in  action  in  August.  The  last  American  soldier left  Afghanistan on 30 August 2021. This marked the end of the Army's nearly  twenty-year  presence  in  Afghanistan  following  the  attacks  of 11 September 2001. On 1 September 2021, Operation Freedom's Sentinel officially ended.  However,  American  over-the-horizon  operations  to counter  extremism  continued  in  Afghanistan  as  part  of  Operation Enduring Sentinel.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Central

During FY 2021, the Army continued to play a prominent role in Iraq, Syria, and Kuwait. The most significant operations occurred in the continuing fight against the remnants of ISIS as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. Combined  Joint  Task  Force-Operation  Inherent  Resolve  maintained control  of  land  operations.  In  addition,  the  Army  maintained  forces focused on theater-wide priorities as part of Operation Spartan Shield. Army casualties for FY 2021 in Operation Inherent Resolve totaled five nonhostile deaths and twenty-four wounded in action.

During  FY  2021,  the  Army  modified  its  presence  in  the  Central Command area of operations. In November 2020, the combat mission against  ISIS  in  Iraq  effectively  ended  as  troop  numbers  dropped  from approximately  3,000 to 2,500. On  26  July 2021, President Biden announced that U.S. troops in Iraq no longer would serve in a combat role. Instead, American forces would remain available to train, to assist, and  to  deal  with  ISIS  as  the  need  arose  in  Iraq.  Some  900  American military personnel also remained in Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence there. During the summer of 2021, the Army also withdrew eight Patriot air defense batteries from Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other nations, as well as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system from Saudi Arabia.

During FY 2021, the Army maintained a BCT in the region as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The BCT provided intelligence support, joint fires, aerial surveillance, training, and base security. In January 2021, the  256th  Infantry  Brigade  Combat  Team  (Louisiana  ARNG)  assumed these  responsibilities  from  the  2d  BCT,  82d  Airborne  Division.  The  1st BCT, 4th Infantry Division, arrived in September 2021 to replace the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

The  Army  maintained  a  division  headquarters,  a  combined  arms battalion,  field  artillery  assets,  and  an  aviation  brigade  in  Kuwait  to support theater-wide commitments as part of Operation Spartan Shield. In November 2020, the headquarters of the 36th Infantry Division (Texas ARNG) deployed to Kuwait, replacing the headquarters of the 42d Infantry Division  (New  York  ARNG).  The  headquarters  of  the  29th  Infantry Division (Virginia ARNG) arrived in July to take over. The Army replaced its rotational armored BCT in Kuwait with a combined arms battalion in May 2021 as part of the reduction of its forces in the area when the 1st Battalion,  194th  Armored  Regiment  (Minnesota  ARNG),  replaced  the 2d  BCT,  1st Armored  Division.  The  75th  Field  Artillery  Brigade's headquarters remained in Kuwait until January 2021 when the headquarters of the 130th Field Artillery Brigade (Kansas ARNG) arrived. The Army also maintained a high-mobility artillery rocket system battalion in the region. The  1st  Battalion,  181st  Field  Artillery  Regiment  (Tennessee  ARNG), replaced the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment, in May 2021. The Combat Aviation Brigade, 28th Infantry Division (Pennsylvania ARNG), replaced the Combat Aviation Brigade, 34th Infantry Division (Minnesota ARNG), in  October  2020.  In  May  2021,  the  Combat  Aviation  Brigade, 40th Infantry Division (California ARNG), arrived to assume this mission. In addition to these forces, Army logistics and transportation units also rotated to and from the Central Command area.

Soldiers  from  Task  Force  Spartan  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates gathered from 24 January to 6 February 2021 at Al Hamra Training Center in the United Arab Emirates for Iron Union 14, the first bilateral training exercise between the forces since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 100 mechanized infantry soldiers from the 2d BCT, 1st Armored Division,  joined  a  reinforced  Emirati  Army  company  to  form  a  single battalion task force for the exercise.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army South

U.S. Army South is responsible for Army operations in Central and South America  and  the  Caribbean.  During  FY  2021,  the  command  resumed regional exercises that had been canceled the previous fiscal year because of the COVID-19  pandemic,  continued  staff  talks,  and  conducted humanitarian relief operations. The missions of Joint Task Force Bravo, stationed  at  Soto  Cano  Air  Base,  Honduras,  and  its  primary  unit,  the 1st  Battalion,  228th  Aviation  Regiment,  include  helicopter  support  for operations  against  organized  crime,  medical  readiness  training,  and disaster relief.  In  November 2020, Joint Task Force Bravo assisted with relief  operations  in  Honduras  and  Guatemala  after  Hurricanes  Eta  and Iota  struck  the  region.  The  task  force  also  conducted  relief  support  in

Haiti  following  a  7.2-magnitude  earthquake  that  struck  the  country  on 12 August. The 525th Military Police Battalion continued to support Joint Task Force Guantanamo.

The 75th Troop Command  (Kentucky ARNG)  served as the headquarters for base camp operations during the thirty-sixth Tradewinds exercise in June 2021. Tradewinds 2021, hosted by Guyana, is a Southern Command-sponsored Caribbean security exercise that saw twelve partner nations  train  together  to  help  foster  regional  cooperation  and  stability. Also participating in the exercise were ARNG contingents from Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, South Dakota, Puerto Rico, New York, and the Virgin Islands. Army forces also participated in the 2021 iteration of the Panamax series  of  multinational  exercises  hosted  by  the  government  of  Panama and supported by Southern Command. The exercises are focused on the security of the Panama Canal.

Army-to-army staff  talks  occurred  with  the  armed  forces  of  Brazil, Colombia,  Chile,  and  Peru.  These  meetings  helped  build  partnerships and coordinate bilateral exercises. In May, the Colombian  Army's Counternarcotics Brigade trained with the 1st Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment (South Carolina ARNG), at the Joint Readiness Training Center at  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana.  In  July,  paratroopers  from  the  2d  Battalion, 501st  Infantry  Regiment,  joined  their  Colombian  counterparts  in  a  sixday  force-employment  exercise  at  Tolemaida  Air  Base  in  Colombia.  In Chile in August, soldiers from the 2d Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, participated in Exercise Southern V anguard. The exercise was conducted at  the  Chilean  Mountain  Warfare  School  in  the  Andes  Mountains,  and focused on survival, movement, and combat in cold weather, high-altitude environments. In October 2020, the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade's (SFAB's)  first  company-sized  advisory  team  returned  to  Fort  Benning, Georgia, from Colombia. During the rest of FY 2021, teams from the 1st SFAB continued to assist their host governments with logistics, services, and intelligence capabilities in support of counternarcotics efforts.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Pacific

Army  forces  permanently  stationed  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  and  the Republic  of  Korea,  along  with  additional  soldiers  from  the  continental United States, participated in a number of exercises in the region during FY 2021. However, some exercises continued to be limited in size because of  ongoing  COVID-19  prevention  measures.  In  March  2021,  soldiers from the 1st Special Forces Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces Regiment, joined Marine Corps and Air Force elements in Exercise Castaway on Okinawa, Japan. Together, they trained  on  expeditionary advanced base operations. This is a new approach to island warfare in the

Western Pacific that uses a relatively small, widely dispersed force to seize and hold territory in the early stages of a conflict.

During  FY  2021,  the  Army  continued  to  build  relationships  with militaries across the Indo-Pacific region. In October 2020, the USAR's 9th Mission Support Command at Fort Shafter Flats, Hawaii, stood up Task Force Oceania to cultivate relationships across the region. The task force consists of RA, USAR, and ARNG soldiers with civil affairs and culturally relevant skills that form two-person teams, each focused on a nation in the area. The 5th SFAB, stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington, is aligned to the Indo-Pacific region. The brigade's goal was to have roughly one-third of  its  820  soldiers  deployed  in  four-to-twelve-soldier  teams  across  the region at all times, while the rest prepared for future missions. During FY 2021, teams from the 5th SFAB were deployed to the Maldives, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India.

U.S. Army Pacific continued its Pacific Pathways program to enhance readiness and build relationships with partner militaries. Launched in 2014,  Pacific  Pathways  combines  multiple  preexisting  exercises  with partner nations into integrated operations. In FY 2021, the Army sent troops  to  Thailand,  Indonesia,  Australia,  Japan,  the  Philippines,  and several smaller nations across the Indo-Pacific region as part of Pacific Pathways. The service planned to deploy about 20,000 soldiers for Pacific Pathways operations during the fiscal year, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Army to scale down to less than 10,000. Regional exercises that were modified because of COVID-19 included Balikatan in April 2021 in the Philippines, Tiger Balm held virtually in Hawaii with Singapore in May, and Cobra Gold in Thailand in August with participants from seven nations.

From June to July 2021, some 1,600 soldiers from the continental United  States  participated  in  multiple  bilateral  training  exercises  with the  Japan  Ground  Self-Defense  Force  partners  across  Japan  as  part  of Orient Shield 21-2. Army participants included elements of the 40th Infantry  Division  (California  ARNG);  the  1st  Battalion,  28th  Infantry Regiment (3d Infantry Division); the 17th Field Artillery Brigade; the 38th Air Defense Artillery Brigade; the Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and members of the 5th SFAB. Among the highlights of the exercise were a bilateral multiple-launch rocket system live fire and U.S. and Japanese aviation units conducting integrated operations as part of Task Force Ninja.

In July, soldiers participated in the biannual Talisman Sabre exercise in Australia. Talisman Sabre 21 involved more than 17,000 participants from seven nations in a month-long multidomain exercise. For the first time,  soldiers  from  the  38th  Air  Defense  Artillery  Brigade  successfully engaged  drone  targets  with  Patriot  missiles  fired  at  the  Shoalwater  Bay

Training  Area  in  Queensland,  Australia.  More  than  100  paratroopers from the 3d Battalion, 509th Infantry Regiment, jumped onto Kangaroo Dropzone  near  Charters  Towers,  Australia,  as  part  of  a  simulated  joint forcible entry operation.

In  FY  2021,  Army  units  participated  in  Defender-Pacific  2021 exercises, which focused on the southwest Pacific region. The primary event of Defender-Pacific 2021 was Forager 21 on Guam, which lasted from 11 July to 6 August. The I Corps headquarters designed and led Forager 21 as a test of a theater army and a corps deploying forces to the Pacific and conducting multidomain operations throughout the region.

In 2004, the U.S. and South Korean governments agreed to move all American forces to garrisons south of the Han River. The United States has relocated most of these forces to Camp Humphreys, about 60 kilometers south of Seoul on the west coast of the peninsula. On 10 December 2020, U.S.  and  South  Korean  officials  agreed  to  transfer  parts  of  U.S.  Army Garrison Yongsan-Casey and a dozen other U.S. military sites to South Korea.  The  decision,  made  during  a  virtual  Status  of  Forces  Agreement Joint Committee meeting, did not include timelines for the handovers.

The armored BCT rotation program begun in 2015 for South Korea continued. The 1st BCT, 3d Infantry Division, arrived to begin its ninemonth rotation in November 2020. It replaced the 2d BCT, 1st Infantry Division. In July 2021, the 3d BCT, 1st Armored Division, arrived to take over.  The  75th  Field  Artillery  Brigade  continued to provide a rotational field artillery battalion equipped with the multiple-launch rocket system to South Korea during FY 2021. In November 2020, the 2d Battalion, 20th Field  Artillery  Regiment,  replaced  the  2d  Battalion,  4th  Field  Artillery Regiment.  The 3d Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment, deployed to Korea  in  July  2021  to  assume  this  mission.  The  Army  also  maintained a  rotational  aviation  battalion  in  South  Korea  during  the  year.  The  2d Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, concluded its rotation in March 2021 when the 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, replaced it.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Europe and Africa

Effective 1 October 2020, the Army consolidated U.S. Army Europe and U.S. Army Africa/Southern European Task Force into a single army service component command that supports United States European Command and  United  States  Africa  Command.  As  part  of  this  reorganization, U.S.  Army  Europe  was  redesignated  as  U.S.  Army  Europe  and  Africa (USAREUR-AF) and continued to report directly to HQDA. U.S. Army Africa/Southern  European  Task  Force  was  redesignated  as  U.S.  Army Southern  European  Task  Force,  Africa,  and  relieved  of  army  service component command responsibilities to U.S. Africa Command. U.S. Army

Southern European Task Force, Africa, reported directly to USAREURAF and all units formerly assigned to U.S. Army Africa were reassigned to USAREUR-AF. The Army also promoted the commanding general of USAREUR-AF, Lt. Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, to general on 7 October 2020. Elevating USAREUR-AF from a three-star to a four-star command reflected its increased responsibilities and signaled American commitment to the defense of Europe.

Two  corps-level  organizations  assumed  operational-  and  tacticallevel functions in USAREUR-AF. The V Corps, activated on 16 October 2020  at  Fort  Knox,  Kentucky,  maintains  a  forward  command  post  in Poznań,  Poland,  and  is  responsible  for  operations  north  of  the  Alps. Those operations include Operation Atlantic Resolve, which exercises rotational forces and units based in Germany. The corps participated in four training exercises during 2021 as part of becoming a combat-capable warfighting  headquarters.  U.S.  Army  Southern  European  Task  Force, Africa, assumed responsibility for operations and assets in Africa and Italy.

Operation Atlantic  Resolve continued to demonstrate U.S. commitment to collective security in Europe during FY 2021. As part of Atlantic Resolve, the Army continued to deploy U.S.-based forces to  Europe  for  nine-month  rotations.  These  rotations  allowed  units  to improve their ability to operate with allied and partner militaries through multinational  training  events,  such  as  the  Combined  Resolve  series of  exercises.  Approximately  6,000  soldiers  participated  in  Atlantic Resolve at any given time, conducting operations and exercises across seventeen countries.

In  FY  2021,  the  Army  conducted  the  second  Defender-Europe exercise. Defender-Europe  is an annual large-scale multinational exercise for improving interoperability with allied and partner militaries. Defender-Europe 2021 integrated more than 28,000 troops from twentysix  nations  at  thirty  training  areas  to  conduct  exercises.  The  continued danger  posed  by  the  COVID-19  virus  necessitated  use  of  mitigation protocols developed in FY 2020 for Defender-Europe.

Defender-Europe  2021  began  in  March  when  the  Army  started moving equipment and personnel from the United States to Europe and moved material from its prepositioned stocks in Europe to training areas. The next phase began in May and June, with multinational training events across Europe and Africa as part of several linked exercises. These exercises included  Immediate  Response,  Saber  Guardian,  Swift  Response, African Lion, and Steadfast Defender. Most of the Army units that participated were Europe-based, including elements of the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion of USAREUR-AF; the 173d Airborne Brigade Combat Team; the 41st Field Artillery Brigade; the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment; the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade; the 405th

Support Brigade; the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade; the 30th Medical Brigade; the 44th Signal Battalion; and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center, 7th Army Training Command. U.S.-based units that participated included  elements  of  the  3d  BCT,  82d  Airborne  Division,  and  ARNG soldiers from Florida, Utah, Georgia, and Wyoming. In June, the V Corps conducted a command post exercise as part of Defender-Europe 2021.

The Army remained active in Africa during FY 2021. In December 2020, the United States repositioned most of its approximately 900 troops in Somalia to locations elsewhere in east Africa. Some 100 U.S. military personnel,  however,  remained  in  Somalia  with  the  U.S.  embassy.  Army special  forces  soldiers  deployed  to  Mozambique  to  train  local  troops  as part of efforts to counter ISIS forces. The 2d SFAB had soldiers deployed on training missions to Tunisia, Djibouti, and Somalia during FY 2021. The U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers Europe District established a permanent presence  in  Africa  to  support  construction  projects  such  as  facilities  at Kainji Air Base in Nigeria and clinics in Benin.

In  addition  to  units  permanently  stationed  in  Europe,  regionally aligned  and  rotational  units  also  supported  missions  of  USAREUR-AF. The headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Division provided a mission command element to oversee the rotational units and provide a division-level command-

and-control  capability  until  July  2021.  At  that  time,  the  headquarters  of the 1st Infantry Division assumed this mission. The Army also continued rotating  an  armored  BCT  to  Europe.  The  2d  BCT,  3d  Infantry  Division, completed its rotation in November 2020 and handed off responsibility to the 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division. In August 2021, the 1st BCT, 1st Infantry Division, took over.

The  rotation  of  an  armor  battalion  to  Pabrade  Training  Area  in Lithuania, begun in FY 2020, continued during FY 2021. The 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, part of 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, replaced the 2d Battalion,  69th  Armored  Regiment, part  of  the  2d  BCT,  3d  Infantry Division. Later in the year, the 3d Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, part of the 1st BCT, 1st Infantry Division, assumed this mission.

The  Army  continued  to  deploy  forces  to  Battle  Group  Poland,  one of  NATO's  four  enhanced  forward-presence  units.  These  multinational battle  groups,  established  in  April  2017,  reinforce  NATO's  eastern  front to deter Russian incursions and work with host-nation defense forces. In February 2021, the 1st Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, a Germany-based unit equipped with the Stryker armored fighting vehicle, replaced the 2d Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment. In July, the 3d Battalion, 161st Infantry Regiment,  81st  Armored  Brigade  Combat  Team  (Washington  ARNG), replaced the 1st Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, in Battle Group Poland. The 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team also provided troops to replace soldiers from the 33d Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Illinois ARNG) as trainers in the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine in April 2021.

Since FY 2017, the Army has deployed a reinforced combat aviation brigade  from  the  United  States  for  a  nine-month  rotation  in  Europe  to supplement the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade. In April 2021, the Combat Aviation  Brigade,  101st  Airborne  Division,  handed  over  responsibility for  this  mission  to  the  Combat  Aviation  Brigade,  1st  Infantry  Division. Since  FY  2018,  the  Army  has  deployed  an  air  defense  artillery  brigade headquarters from the United States to serve as the air defense mission command element in Europe.  The  678th  Air  Defense  Artillery  Brigade (South Carolina ARNG) relinquished this mission to the 174th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (Ohio ARNG) in February 2021.

## Domestic Operations

In February 2021, the Federal Emergency Management Agency requested assistance from DoD to operate COVID-19 vaccination centers across the United States. The Federal Emergency Management Agency initially asked for up to 10,000 troops to operate 100 centers. U.S. Army North, the Army service component command for United States Northern Command, led the overall DoD effort. The military personnel used for this mission were

mostly from active Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps units. U.S. Army North deployed them in three ways. Type 1 response teams consisted of 222 personnel who could administer up to 6,000 vaccine doses per day. Type  2  response  teams  had  139  personnel  who  could  administer  3,000 shots  daily.  The  third  type  of  deployment  used  smaller  teams,  typically around twenty-five strong.

The first DoD-operated COVID-19 vaccine site opened on 16 February in Los Angeles, California, and was staffed by an Army Type 1 team. By 16 March, the Army had Type 1 teams in Chicago, Illinois; Cleveland, Ohio; and Atlanta, Georgia; and Type 2 teams in Dallas, Texas; Orlando, Florida; and Miami, Florida. The Army deployed five smaller team-four to cities in New Jersey, and one to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The 1,400 soldiers for these teams came from Fort Carson; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Stewart; Fort Riley, Kansas; Fort Bliss; and various U.S. Army Medical Command units. U.S. Army North concluded its vaccine support mission on  22  June.  In  total,  more  than  5,100  military  personnel  deployed  to twenty-five  states  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  They  administered  more than 16 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, 5 million of which were given by soldiers.

The  DoD,  in  response  to  a  request  from  the  Department  of Homeland Security in June 2020, authorized the continued deployment of up to 4,000 military personnel, consisting mostly of ARNG soldiers, to the southwest border through the end of FY 2021. By 16 December, some  3,600  ARNG  and  reserve  troops  were  deployed  to  the  border. These  forces,  under  the  control  of  U.S.  Northern  Command  and assisting  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  constructed  fencing  and temporary  barriers,  conducted  surveillance,  and  provided  logistical support. In February 2021, the status of ARNG soldiers deployed to the border changed from Title 32 to Title 10, limiting their participation in law enforcement. In June, DoD extended the military's border mission through  30  September  2022,  after  the  Department  of  Homeland Security requested its continued support. The Army capped this new force  at  3,000  troops  that  continued  to  be  drawn  mostly  from  the ARNG. Since June 2019, the Army has assigned control over all forces deployed to the southwest border in a Title 10 status to a brigade-sized headquarters.  In  October  2020,  the  110th  Maneuver  Enhancement Brigade  (Missouri  ARNG)  assumed  this  mission  from  the  3d  BCT, 101st Airborne Division.

A  surge  in  unaccompanied  children  crossing  the  southern  border resulted in a dramatic rise in referrals to the Department of Health and Human Services. In March 2021, that department asked DoD for assistance with  accommodating  some  of  these  children  on  military  installations. The largest such facility for this mission, located on Fort Bliss opened on

30 March and had the capacity to care for up to 10,000 children. The facility at Fort Bliss remained in operation through the end of FY 2021.

The DoD provided the Department of State with temporary housing, medical  care,  and  general  support  for  up  to  50,000  Afghan  evacuees  at eight  military  installations  in  the  United  States.  This  effort  was  known as  Operation  Allies  Refuge.  Army  installations  used  for  Operation Allies Refuge were Camp Atterbury, Indiana; Joint Base MacGuire-DixLakehurst, New Jersey; Fort Bliss; Fort Lee, Virginia; Fort Pickett, Virginia; and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The military also supported the Department of Homeland Security-led Operation Allies Welcome that coordinated the efforts of multiple government agencies to support Afghan evacuees. These operations continued through the end of FY 2021.

On  31 August, approximately 200 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Washington,  deployed  to  northern  California  to  help  fight  wildfires there, including the Dixie Fire, in response to a request from the National Interagency Fire Center and the U.S. Forest Service. The soldiers came from the 2d Infantry Division's 23d Engineer Battalion and 2d Battalion, 3d Infantry Regiment. The soldiers received training on firefighting and mainly served in support roles, digging fire lines, suppressing small hot spots in already burned areas, and conducting small controlled burns. The mission ended on 29 September.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Structure

The  ARNG  force  structure  in  FY  2021  had  thirteen  command  and control  headquarters:  eight  divisional,  two  expeditionary  sustainment commands, and one each for military police, theater sustainment, and air and missile defense. It had twenty-seven BCTs: five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker. There were forty-two multifunctional support brigades  in  the  ARNG:  eight  aviation,  eight  fires,  sixteen  maneuver enhancement,  and  ten  sustainment.  There  were  fifty-seven  functional support brigades and groups. The force structure also included one SFAB and two special forces groups.

The ARNG Directorate, located in Arlington, Virginia, reports to the National Guard Bureau. It develops and administers ARNG policies and programs. The directorate consists of the Office of the Director, ARNG, and the ARNG Readiness Center, which is a field-operating agency of the National Guard Bureau. Additionally, staff from the Office of the Chief, National  Guard  Bureau,  provides  support  to  the  ARNG  Directorate  in areas such as public affairs, legislative liaising, and contracting. In FY 2021, the ARNG Directorate was made up of 772 military personnel and 402 civilian employees.

The  USAR  is  organized  under  a  single  general  officer  with  staff responsibilities to the Department of the Army as the chief of the USAR and command authority over most USAR soldiers as the commander of the U.S. Army Reserve Command. The Office of the Chief of Army Reserve, located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, supports the chief of the USAR in advising the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army on USAR matters. USAR Command, located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, manages USAR operational readiness through twenty-six major subordinate commands.

Approximately 2,000 units are organized into twenty-two functional commands  and  seven  geographic  commands-three  mission  support commands  and  four  readiness  divisions.  Reserve  personnel  in  Active Guard Reserve status increased from 16,543 on 1 October 2020 to 16,671 at the end of the fiscal year. The USAR civilian workforce declined from 12,521 at the start of FY 2021, to 12,398 at the end of the fiscal year. Military technicians made up the bulk of the USAR civilian workforce.

On  4  January 2021, the chief of the Army  Reserve  issued  a memorandum on  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Army  Reserve  and  USAR Command  reorganization, realignment, and reporting relationships

that  stated  the  two  organizations  are  'separate  staffs  with  distinct  roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships. ' She directed the two entities to plan and execute a return to the 'two staffs' construct. The memorandum established  that  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Army  Reserve  justifies  and executes  the  USAR  budget,  leads  programming,  manages  the  full-time support  program,  and  interfaces  between  the  component  and  HQDA. The  USAR Command serves as the USAR operational staff,  establishes policies  for  USAR  functional  and  geographic  commands,  and  executes USAR operations as a subordinate of U.S. Army Forces Command. This realignment process generated a number of organizational changes. The Army Reserve Installation Management Division, previously viewed as a single staff with two locations, became entirely located within the USAR Command  G-3/5/7.  The  Strategic  Communications  Directorate  was divided, with strategic communications responsibilities placed under the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve while public affairs duties remained at USAR Command.

The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's 1st Space Brigade activated the USAR's 6th Space Company on 16 September 2021. It is the third USAR space company. These companies field Army space support teams. Each team has six soldiers and provides other units with capabilities such as space situational awareness, commercial imagery downloads, and Global Positioning System position-navigation-timing operations.

## Mobilizations

At the start of  FY 2021, 240 USAR units and 11,058 personnel were in mobilization status. Over the course of the fiscal year, 664 USAR units and 11,530  personnel  received  mobilization  orders.  During  FY  2021,  2,897 personnel supported U.S. Northern Command, 6,175 personnel supported Central Command, 1,008 personnel supported U.S. European Command, and  1,161  personnel  supported  Southern  Command.  Mobilizations  in support of United States Indo-Pacific Command included 213 personnel, and 76 personnel supported U.S. Africa Command ( Table 12 ).

During FY 2021, reserve component strength deployed to the Mexican border on Title 10 federal active duty averaged 3,700 personnel. Separate from this operation, the governors of Arizona and Texas deployed troops from their ARNG to the Mexican border in FY 2021. These troops served in  Title  32  state  active  duty  status.  In  June  2021,  the  two  governors sent  a  letter  to  all  other  state  governors  requesting  that  they,  under  the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, provide Arizona and Texas with  reinforcements  for  duty  on  the  Mexican  border.  The  governors  of Arkansas, Ohio, and South Dakota deployed ARNG troops in state active duty status in response to this request. South Dakota's governor funded her

state's deployment by accepting a $1 million donation from a businessman in Tennessee. In the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress prohibited the use of private funds to pay for any ARNG deployment to another state except for natural disaster emergencies.

The use of ARNG units for missions outside the continental United States continued in FY 2021. In addition to those mentioned in Chapter 5, the headquarters of South Dakota's 196th Maneuver  Enhancement Brigade  deployed  to  Camp  Lemonnier,  Djibouti,  as  the  core  staff  for Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa. To support the Multinational Force and Observer mission in the Sinai, personnel from Pennsylvania's 104th  Cavalry  Regiment  replaced  personnel  from  Texas's  133d  Field Artillery  Regiment.  ARNG  units  also  continued  to  participate  in  the European  Defense  Initiative.  Operations  to  support  the  Kosovo  Force continued in FY 2021, with ARNG personnel from Iowa serving alongside troops  from  Poland  and  Turkey,  as  part  of  Kosovo  Force  Regional Command-East ( Table 13 ).

## COVID-19 Pandemic Operations

During  FY  2021,  both  reserve  components  played  a  prominent  role  in the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 1 October 2020,

15,438  ARNG  personnel  were  serving  on  pandemic  related  missions. Rising infection rates led to further activations; by 1 March, 24,439 ARNG soldiers supported COVID-19 missions. The remainder of the fiscal year saw a decline in ARNG use; at the end of FY 2021, there were 10,880 ARNG personnel on duty for COVID-19 missions.

ARNG personnel transported medical supplies, assisted with mortuary affairs, and managed call centers. In some areas, they worked with food banks  and  distributed  meals  to  vulnerable  individuals.  ARNG  soldiers stepped  in  to  support  local  and  state  government  functions  hampered by personnel shortages. In September 2021, for example, Massachusetts activated  ARNG  soldiers  to  operate  school  buses  in  thirteen  school districts.  A  number  of  states  used  their  ARNG  to  operate  COVID-19 vaccination facilities.

In FY 2020, eighteen USAR UAMTFs had deployed to areas greatly affected by the pandemic. Each UAMTF included personnel with a range of  specialties,  from  doctors,  nurses,  and  respiratory  therapists  to  supply and administrative staff. In the first half of FY 2021, UAMTFs remained

deployed in Utah, California, Kentucky, New York, Wisconsin, Arizona, and New Mexico. Two UAMTFs remained active until June 2021, providing assistance to the Yuma and Navajo nations in New Mexico and Arizona. In March 2021, the USAR began planning for vaccination augmentation medical  task  forces,  but  no  task  forces  were  established  because  either most communities had adequate numbers of healthcare workers to deliver the amount of vaccines available or governors mobilized elements of their ARNG for this mission.

## Disaster Relief Operations

Throughout the fiscal year, the ARNG and USAR participated in disaster relief  operations.  On  9  October  2020,  Hurricane  Delta  reached  landfall near  Cameron,  Louisiana.  The  Louisiana  National  Guard  responded  by activating more than 1,500 service members; Texas and Mississippi also activated  additional  ARNG  personnel.  The  Hurricane  Delta  response mission  ended  on  14  November  2020.  Hurricane  Zeta  reached  landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, on 28 October, and by 29 October, 367 ARNG personnel from Alabama and Louisiana deployed to handle its aftermath.

A period of severe winter weather in February 2021 led to the activation of several thousand ARNG personnel across the southern United States.

<!-- image -->

Significant snow and ice accumulations, combined with low temperatures, led  to  power  outages  and  disrupted  transportation.  In  response  to  this winter  weather,  on  26  February  2021,  2,369  ARNG  personnel  provided assistance in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio.

Hurricane  Henri  made  landfall  near  Westerly,  Rhode  Island,  on 22 August. In response to heavy rainfall and strong winds throughout the New England area, 120 ARNG personnel were activated in Connecticut, 220  in  Rhode  Island,  454  in  Massachusetts,  and  351  in  New  York.  On 29  August  2021,  Hurricane  Ida,  an  exceptionally  strong  storm,  made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Heavy rains and high winds led to  widespread  flooding  and  extensive  property  damage.  The  severity of  damage necessitated the establishment on 31 August of a dual status command, Joint Task Force-Ida, so the Louisiana National Guard could direct  other  states'  National  Guard  units  sent  to  assist  Louisiana.  By 10  September,  6,510  ARNG  personnel  were  assisting  with  search  and rescue efforts, evacuation, delivery of food and water, and damage cleanup.

In FY 2021, the ARNG again deployed to fight wildfires. Personnel worked on the ground alongside firefighters and operated fixed-wing and rotor aircraft in California, Arizona, Oregon, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, and North Dakota. In April, firefighting operations  for  the  season  began  with  twenty-five  soldiers  activated  in

North Dakota. By 10 August, twelve states had 1,270 ARNG personnel engaged in fighting wildfires.  Cooler  weather  the  next  month  led  to  a decrease in fires, and on 29 September, only 384 ARNG personnel were engaged in wildfire missions.

Two of the most destructive wildfires faced by ARNG personnel were in  California.  The  Dixie  Fire  started  on  13  July  and  eventually  burned more  than  950,000  acres.  ARNG  personnel  from  several  western  states deployed to assist in evacuating people and cutting containment lines to slow the fire's spread. The Caldor Fire in California began on 14 August and eventually burned more than 200,000 acres. ARNG personnel helped with evacuation and, despite the destruction of more than 1,000 structures by the fire, there were no fatalities.

## Readiness

Reserve  component  efforts  to  improve  readiness  and  reduce  deployment timelines continued during FY 2021. The USAR conducted two combined

arms  kinetic  exercises.  One  held  at  Camp  Atterbury,  Indiana,  included units from the Indiana National Guard and four USAR units, comprising roughly 400 personnel. The second, at Fort Stewart, Georgia, included thirty USAR units, comprising roughly 1,800 soldiers. The quartermaster liquid logistics exercise involved twenty-two fuel and water distribution units with more than 3,700 soldiers. Two ARNG brigades, the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team from Mississippi and the 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from Oklahoma, completed a rotation at the National Training Center. Three ARNG brigades completed rotations at the Joint Readiness Training Center: the  37th  Infantry  Brigade  Combat  Team  from  Ohio,  the  39th  Infantry Brigade Combat Team from Arkansas, and the 54th SFAB from Indiana.

The ARNG continued to support the State Partnership Program. The National Guard Bureau administers the State Partnership Program, which pairs U.S. states and territories with other countries. This enables ARNG personnel and units to build long-term relationships by conducting regular military-to-military activities and participating in various exercises with partner nations. These interactions occurred during large-scale combatant command multinational exercise and in other venues.

## Cyber

Ransomware and other cyber threats increased in FY 2021, and ARNG cyber units became involved in responding to these threats. On 1 November 2020, a total of fifty-eight ARNG personnel were on duty to protect the elections in  Connecticut,  Delaware,  Iowa,  Illinois,  Louisiana,  North  Carolina,  New Mexico,  Rhode  Island,  Washington,  and  Wyoming  from  cyber  threats that month. Cyber Shield 21, a training exercise conducted in July 2021, brought together more than 700 ARNG personnel to develop and test cyber defense procedures to better protect targets such as power plants and supply chains. In August 2021, the Arizona ARNG activated soldiers in response to a cyberattack on the Kingman city government's computer system.

## Civil Unrest

The District of Columbia National Guard is unique in that the president, not the city's mayor, controls it via a chain of command that runs through the DoD. Authority to activate the D.C. National Guard is delegated by the  president  to  the  secretary  of  defense,  and  further  delegated  to  the secretary of the Army. On 4 January 2021, the acting secretary of defense, in consultation with the secretary of the Army, approved the activation of 340 personnel from the D.C. National Guard for managing traffic control points  during  a  planned  demonstration  protesting  the  results  of  the November 2020 presidential election.

On 6 January 2021, a mob of the president's supporters attacked the Capitol Building in an insurrection that sought to prevent the Congress from certifying the election of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the next president of  the  United  States.  In  the  early  afternoon  of  6  January,  in  response  to urgent requests for assistance from D.C. civil authorities, the secretary of

the Army ordered the full mobilization of the D.C. National Guard. He subsequently received approval from the acting secretary of defense for the Guard to conduct perimeter and clearance operations in support of the Capitol Police. Guard personnel arrived at the Capitol at 1740 that day, and the Capitol Police declared the Capitol Building secure at 2000.

Over  the  following  days,  almost  26,000  Guard  soldiers  and  airmen from multiple states deployed to the National Capital Region ahead of the presidential inauguration on 20 January. Armed troops took up positions at  the  entry  points  to  the  Capitol  campus  and  ran  patrols  of  the  now fenced-in  grounds  to  support  the  Capitol  Police  force.  Guard  members also provided logistical support and helped facilitate communication for the many federal authorities at the Capitol. On Inauguration Day, Guard soldiers and airmen lined the new president's motorcade route. The ARNG, in  Operation  Capitol  Response,  continued  security,  communications, medical  evacuation,  and  logistics  support  authorities  in  the  National Capital  Region  through  the  spring  of  2021.  Force  strength  declined  to 2,200 by the end of March, and the mission concluded in late May. On 13  April,  DoD  approved  award  of  the  Armed  Forces  Service  Medal  for Guard members who had participated in Operation Capitol Response and the presidential inauguration security operation.

The  April  2021  trial  of  the  Minneapolis,  Minnesota,  police  officer accused  of  murdering  George  P .  Floyd  Jr.  in  May  2020  prompted  some states  to  activate  ARNG  units  in  case  civil  unrest  followed  the  trial.  By 15 April, more than 3,300 Minnesota ARNG soldiers were on active duty. By 20 April, when the jury delivered its guilty verdict, nine states and the District  of  Columbia  had  activated  a  total  of  8,410  ARNG  soldiers  as  a precautionary measure.

In April 2021, the Office of the Inspector General released its review of the investigation into the actions of a District of Columbia ARNG medical evacuation helicopter that had hovered low over protesters in the city on 1 June 2020. On 3 June 2020, the D.C. National Guard commanding general had  ordered  an  investigation  of  this  incident  under  Army  Regulation 15-6.  The  inspector  general's  review  concluded  that  the  use  of  medical evacuation helicopters in this manner was not prohibited by federal law, federal policy, or Army regulation. The review also determined that using the helicopter in support of civil disturbance operations was reasonable given the situation on 1 June 2020, and that there was a systematic lack of  understanding  regarding  the  employment  of  helicopters  during  civil disturbance operations.

## Logistics

## Management

In November  2020,  the  Army  published  a  directive  on  achieving persistent modernization. The directive clarified the relationships of the major organizations within the Army modernization enterprise to enable unity of effort. It also directed the rapid revision and update of applicable policies  and  processes  to  reflect  AFC's  role  in  modernization.  Federal law and existing Army policy make the Office of the ASA (ALT) the lead organization for materiel acquisition. The directive requires that this office, in regard to its acquisition function, ensure that AFC receives the support it  needs  for  its  mission  to  lead  and  integrate  the  Army  modernization enterprise.  The  office  will  jointly  establish  with  AFC  the  number  of acquisition  personnel  working  with  the  command's  cross  functional teams, jointly prepare a science and technology plan, and work with AFC on resourcing decisions to support the service's modernization priorities. The two organizations will establish a joint technology maturation board to govern support for AFC and establish formal transition agreements for maturing materiel capabilities.

In July 2020, the ASA (ALT) and the Army Contracting Enterprise established an  executive  committee  to  serve  as  an  enterprise-level governance board to improve Army contracting programs, policies, and procedures. It is composed of each head of contracting activity in the Army, with the Army deputy assistant secretary for procurement serving as the chair.  The  executive  committee  created  the Contracting  2028  Strategic Plan ,  a  guide  for  preparing  the  contracting  workforce  for  the  future  as well as for fostering the development of stable, lasting relationships with key  stakeholders.  Additionally,  the  plan  will  promote  the  adoption  of emerging technologies that will improve the overall effectiveness of the contracting enterprise.

During  FY  2021,  the  deputy  assistant  secretary  for  procurement conducted a major revision of the Army's policy for other transactions, which are legally binding instruments the federal government uses with industry and academia for research and developing prototypes.  They are not standard procurement contracts and generally are not subject to the laws  and  regulations  that  apply  to  government  procurement  contracts. The  Army  last  had  published  this  policy  in  May  2019.  An  integrated process team conducted the review. The revision streamlines the Army's

other transaction policies and reduces possible friction points to improve engagement with nontraditional vendors.

In  July  2021,  the  Army  issued  a  revision  of  materiel  classification and  fielding policy by dividing Army  Regulation  700-142, Type Classification,  Materiel  Release,  Fielding,  and  Transfer ,  into  two  new publications:  Army  Regulation  770-2, Materiel  Fielding , and  Army Regulation 770-3, Type Classification and Materiel Release . The revision added responsibilities in this area for AFC and instituted policy on typeclassifying commercial medical devices, procedures for when a materiel system does not achieve a full material release designation within thirtysix months after being designated as a conditional material release, and planning for managing the materiel system conditions and associated funding  of  systems  approved  for  transition  to  sustainment  that  are designated  as  a  conditional  materiel  release.  (Conditional  materiel release is a temporary designation used no longer than thirty-six months as  a  method  to  field  materiel  systems  with  conditions  and  associated risks that prevent satisfying full materiel release.)

## Logistics and the COVID-19 Pandemic

The  Joint  Program  Executive  Office-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND)  continued to provide DoD acquisition support for Operation W arp Speed. In FY 2021, JPEO-CBRND, in  partnership  with  U.S.  Army  Contracting  Command,  handled  more than $43 billion in contract actions for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, personal protection equipment, and for expanding the domestic industrial base. Of that amount, approximately $19 billion was used for six vaccine development and manufacturing contracts.  Additionally,  JPEO-CBRND worked  to  make  sure  that  COVID-19  testing  was  available  for  service members.  It  switched  to  a  less  complex  method  of  testing.  It  ensured that supplies, such as nasal swabs for testing and syringes and needles for vaccine injection, were readily available.

The JPEO-CBRND, the Commercial Travel Office, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Joint Science and Technology Office continued research into wearable health monitoring. The joint effort monitored more than  10,000  participants  and  conducted  an  illness  prediction  study  of more than 5,800 cadets and midshipmen from the United States Military Academy  and  the  United  States  Naval  Academy.  The  study  tested  the concept of wearables-based prediction to see if they could identify potential COVID-19 infection. The JPEO-CBRND and ASA (ALT) then supported a limited-user test of more than 3,000 Military Academy cadets. The cadets used the wearables so that the study could trace contact between COVID-19 positive  individuals  and  others.  The  data  from  this  test  will  be  used  to

inform  a  joint  emergent  operational  needs  statement  for  a  successful contract tracing method.

The  JPEO-CBRND,  working  with  the  Program  Executive  Office Enterprise  Information  Systems  and  the  Office  of  the  Surgeon  General, created  a  better  system  to  track  soldiers'  vaccination  status.  The  JPEOCBRND also worked with a contractor to more than double the Advanced Development  and  Manufacturing  facility's  production  capacity.  This enhanced capacity enabled DoD to create and manufacture vaccines and other medical countermeasures rapidly in the event of another pandemic. Additionally,  as  an  extension  of  the  Army's  vaccination  efforts,  JPEOCBRND fulfilled agreements for international vaccine donations as part of the COVAX initiative.

The  Army's  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  program connects  small  businesses  and  their  technologies  with  critical  Army programs. It awards more than $2 billion a year to small and nontraditional businesses  to  help  sustain the service's readiness  and  technological superiority. In October 2020, ASA (ALT) established the Army Applied SBIR program. It encompasses 80 percent of the service's SBIR portfolio and  is  focused  on  the  timely  transition  and  sustainment  of  innovative technologies created by small businesses that are funded through frequent and  flexible  contract  awards.  In  August  2021,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Research  and  Technology)  established the  SBIR  Contracting  Center  of  Excellence.  The  center  consolidates  all Applied SBIR Phase I and Phase II contracting resources into a single office to create maximum efficiency in the execution of contracts, oversight of awards, and partnership with small businesses.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017 mandated the use of modular open-systems approaches in major defense acquisition programs and  major  automated  information  systems.  Using  this  concept,  the military designs systems with modules that can be competed separately and acquired from different vendors. This approach allows more flexibility and  competition  in  the  acquisition  of  systems,  subsystems,  software components, and services. Congress directed DoD to design and develop all major defense acquisition programs receiving Milestone A or Milestone B approval after 1 January 2019 with this concept to the maximum extent practicable.  In  FY  2021,  the  ASA  (ALT)'s  Office  of  the  Chief  Systems Engineer introduced the Common Modular Open Architecture concept. Using this approach will permit the Army to establish unified standards for  future  air  and  ground vehicles, allowing them to share components. The Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle program will be the first to use

the new open-architecture approach. The service also intends to use the concept, wherever possible, when upgrading existing vehicles.

The Office of the Chief Systems Engineer also successfully piloted the Architecture Development Kit, which gave users a single tool for developing architectures that use the same libraries, nomenclatures, lexicons, and style guides. The products created in this manner are standardized, consistent, shareable, and interoperable.

In FY 2021, the Army initiated testing of the Trophy Active Protection System,  which  was  installed  on  M1A2  Abrams  System  Enhancement Package Version 3 tanks to inform the urgent materiel release scheduled for June 2022. The system detects and intercepts antitank guided missiles and  rocket-propelled  grenades.  Preliminary  analysis  indicates  that  the system effectively detects and intercepts most of the incoming threats in basic range conditions and engagements.

The armored multi-purpose vehicle is the replacement for the M113 family of vehicles in armored BCTs. At the end of FY 2020, the contractor was six to eight months behind the original schedule to deliver vehicles for use in initial operational testing and evaluation. In January 2021, the Army completed system-level live-fire testing on prototype vehicles and revised the program's schedule. Initial operational testing and evaluation is scheduled to begin in March 2022. Full system-level testing started in May 2021 and is expected to be completed in March 2022.

In FY 2019, the secretary of the Army directed the accelerated delivery of a prototype ground-launched hypersonic weapon. This system, termed Dark Eagle, is a rapid prototyping program, and the Army is working with the Navy to develop it, with the Navy as the lead designer and the Army as the production lead. Each service will use Dark Eagle, developing individual weapon systems and launchers tailored for their needs. During FY 2021, the  Army  equipped  the  first  Dark  Eagle  firing  battery  with  prototype ground equipment, including transporter-launchers, a battery operations center, and inert missile canisters. The unit will use the equipment during FY 2022 to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures for this system.

The  XM  1299  extended-range  cannon  artillery  system  integrates new cannon and projectile technologies with the M109A7 self-propelled howitzer  chassis.  The  first  two  XM  1299  prototypes  were  delivered  in September  2021  to  the  4th  Battalion,  27th  Field  Artillery  Regiment. Completion of operational testing for the system is expected in FY 2023.

The FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act required the Army to acquire the Israeli Iron Dome air defense system as an interim capability against artillery rockets and cruise missiles, and to deploy an Iron Dome battery to an operational theater by the end of 2021. In August 2019, the United States and Israel signed an agreement for the procurement of two Iron Dome firing batteries. In FY 2021, that equipment arrived at Fort Bliss,

Texas,  mounted on U.S. Army heavy expanded-mobility tactical trucks. To  operate  Iron  Dome,  the  Army  converted  a  Terminal  High  Altitude Area Defense battery and activated a new battery using resources from the Air Defense Artillery School. Members of the Israeli Missile Defense Organization led the batteries' training on the system. In August 2021, one battery successfully engaged eight cruise missile surrogate targets at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

The Mobile Short-Range Air Defense system consists of Stinger and Longbow Hellfire missiles, a 30-mm. cannon, a machine gun, an electrooptical sight system, and a multihemispheric radar mounted on a Stryker Double V-Hull vehicle. The system is part of the Army's efforts to rebuild its short-range air defense capabilities. In FY 2021, an air defense artillery battalion  in  Germany  was  the  first  unit  to  field  the  system.  The  Army plans  initially  to  field  144  Mobile  Short-Range  Air  Defense  systems  to four battalions.

Currently,  infantry  BCTs  do  not  have  a  vehicle  with  a  mobile, protected, direct-fire capability. The Mobile Protected Firepower program will  produce an armored tracked vehicle with a 105-mm. main gun for use  in  infantry  BCTs  against  light  armored  vehicles,  fortifications,  and dismounted troops. Two vendors provided prototypes. During FY 2021,

troops  from  the  82d  Airborne  Division  conducted  a  soldier  vehicle assessment of the prototypes, and the Army completed its live-fire test and evaluation of them. The limited-user test of the vehicles began in September 2021 and will continue into FY 2022. The Army expects to make its lowrate production decision for the program in the third quarter of FY 2022 and field the system to units beginning in FY 2025.

The joint assault bridge is an M1A1 Abrams chassis-based, armoredvehicle-launched bridge system. The Army  conducted the second operational testing and evaluation of the vehicle in November 2020. The vehicle's performance showed that the contractor had remedied problems that  had  been  identified  during  the  first  test  in  2019.  The  joint  assault bridge entered full-rate production later in FY 2021, and several armored BCTs had received it by the end of the fiscal year.

The infantry squad vehicle will provide mobility on the battlefield for a nine-soldier light infantry squad and associated equipment. The contractor delivered the first low-rate initial production vehicle in October 2020. The service  conducted  initial  operational  testing  and  evaluation  during  FY 2021, including airdropping the vehicle from Air Force transport aircraft. The full-rate production decision on the vehicle is scheduled for May 2022.

The Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit program consists of the Leader and Manpack radios for infantry companies. The Leader radio is a

two-channel, handheld, software-defined radio for tactical voice and data communications. The Manpack is a two-channel, software-defined radio employed  by  general  purpose  radio  users  to  operate  two  simultaneous waveforms. In FY 2021, the Army conducted an initial operational testing and evaluation and an adversarial assessment of the Leader AN/PRC-148 and AN/PRC-163 variants and the Manpack AN/PRC-158 and AN/PRC162  variants  using  an  airborne  infantry  battalion.  In  August  2021,  the Army approved full-rate production for the Leader and Manpack radios.

Gunsmoke-J  is  a  joint-capability  technology-demonstration  satellite program run by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the Assured Positioning, Navigation, and Timing/Space Cross Functional Team. Its purpose is to examine how small satellites in low Earth-orbit can provide data directly to Army units for use in multidomain operations. During FY 2021, the program launched three satellites.

Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense is a system that integrates sensors, weapons, and a common mission command interface across an integrated fire-control network. Software testing identified deficiencies in some critical capabilities, which caused the Army to delay the initial operational testing and evaluation of the system from September 2021 to  January  2022.  The  full-rate  production  decision  is  scheduled  for December 2022.

Assured  Positioning,  Navigation,  and  Timing  systems  will  provide ground forces with access to trusted position-navigation-timing information in environments that degrade or deny access to the Global Positioning  System  and  in  the  presence  of  electromagnetic-spectrum interference  or  enemy  jamming  and  spoofing.  In  2019,  AFC  issued directed requirements for the rapid prototyping, operational assessment, and  limited  fielding  of  mounted  and  dismounted  systems.  The  Project Management  Office  Positioning,  Navigation  &amp;  Timing  is  using  several other transaction authority contracts and a phased prototyping approach to  satisfy  the  requirements.  Throughout  FY  2021,  U.S.  Army  Test  and Evaluation Command and the program manager conducted several testfix-test cycles for both mounted and dismounted systems.

The Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool is a software application  used  to  plan,  coordinate,  integrate,  and  synchronize  cyberelectromagnetic activities from battalion to theater level. During FY 2021, the Army completed an initial operational testing and evaluation of the tool. A full deployment decision on the tool is expected in FY 2022.

In  FY  2021,  the  Joint  Counter-Small  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems Office held two demonstrations at Yuma Proving Ground, inviting vendors to  demonstrate  methods  for  countering  small  drones.  These  methods included  shooting  down  drones  and  disrupting  them  with  electronic warfare systems. Participants also examined new approaches to creating

low-collateral  effects,  that  is,  they  explored  methods  to  limit  damage  to friendly forces near the intercept area.

The Integrated Visual Augmentation System is a low-profile, ruggedized, heads-up display with a body-borne computer pack, conformal wearable battery, squad radio, and integrated sensors. In December 2020, after completion of Capability Set 3 testing, DoD approved the program to  transition  from  rapid  prototyping  to  rapid  fielding.  It  authorized  the Army to procure up to 10,000 Capability Set 4 systems, the productionready device, but it required the Army to verify that it had corrected the problems that had been noted during Capability Set 3 testing before the service could conduct the Capability Set 4 initial operational testing and evaluation or field the device.

## Foreign Military Sales

The  Army's  Foreign  Military  Sales  program  is  part  of  the  overall  U.S. Defense Security Assistance program. It oversees the sale of ground forces equipment, training supplies, and services to foreign countries. Further, it is a significant element of U.S. foreign policy and helps strengthen bilateral defense relationships and improve interoperability between U.S. forces and foreign partners.

During FY 2021, Australia received approval to buy Javelin missiles and related equipment for $46 million, 155-mm. ammunition and related equipment  for  $132.2  million,  and  CH-47F  helicopters  and  related equipment for $259 million. It also received approval to purchase heavy armored combat systems and related equipment for $1.685 billion and AH-64E helicopters and related equipment for $3.5 billion. The Taipei Economic  and  Cultural  Representative  Office  received  approval  to buy eleven high-mobility artillery rocket system launchers and related equipment for $436.1 million. Finland received approval to buy extendedrange guided multiple-launch rocket systems and related equipment for $91.2  million.  Georgia  received  approval  to  buy  Javelin  missiles  and related equipment for $30 million. The government of Kuwait received approval to purchase eight AH-64E helicopters and related equipment for $4 billion as well as heavy tactical vehicles with support and related equipment for $445 million. Lebanon received permission to buy up to 300 M1152 Humvees and related equipment for $55.5 million. Norway's request to purchase Javelin missiles and related equipment for $36 million was approved. North Macedonia received approval to buy Stryker vehicles and related equipment for $210 million. Thailand was authorized to buy Javelin missiles and related equipment for $83.5 million.

## Support Services

## Installations

In its annual assessment for FY 2021, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff,  G-9,  found  that  installation  readiness  remained  at  risk.  Nearly a  quarter  of  Army  facilities  are  in  poor  or  failing  condition  requiring renovation,  and  there  is  a  need  for  new  construction.  The  assessment also anticipates projected risk will increase through FY 2026-two years longer than previously estimated-because  of  reduced  sustainment funding, personnel shortages in key service areas, and expanded facility requirements  affecting  installations.  In  addition,  Army  personnel  and families  are  increasingly  vulnerable  from  threats  like  social  media, cyberattacks, and disinformation campaigns.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy, and Environment) (ASA [IEE]) began an economizing measure in October 2020.  A  new  policy  required  all  Army  installations  to  install  building automation systems, monitored from a central location, to reduce energy, water, and maintenance costs. Fort Benning, Fort Bragg, Fort Hood, and Fort  Knox already had adopted building automation systems to control lighting,  heating,  ventilation,  and  air-conditioning,  and  they  reported significant benefits. ASA (IEE) estimated that the new policy could achieve an annual energy savings of 5 to 15 percent. Moreover, building automation systems would enable predictive and preventive maintenance that could reduce servicing costs by up to 50 percent.

The ASA (IEE) released the Army Installations  Strategy in  December 2020. The objective is to create modern, resilient, and sustainable installations capable of enhancing strategic readiness while providing quality facilities, services, and support to soldiers, families, and civilians. Each installation will be both a platform of capabilities as well as an active node within a broader constellation  of  installations,  connected  across  the  Army  enterprise.  The strategy anticipates not only attacks by adversaries in cyberspace but also challenges  from  the  natural  environment-extreme  weather,  pandemics, environmental degradation-produced by climate change. Climate change will also increase the demand for water and electricity.

The strategy has four lines of effort. The first, 'Take Care of People, ' encompasses modern facilities, services, and safe operations. The second is  to  'Enhance Readiness and Resilience' by implementing solutions for protection,  resilience,  mission  assurance,  education,  and  training.  The

third, 'Modernize and Innovate,' looks for new ways to provide services and  find  efficiencies.  The  fourth,  'Promote  Stewardship, '  cares  for  our natural  resources  through  sustainability,  remediation,  and  technology innovation, and includes climate change mitigation and adaptation. The service's intent is to modernize all 156 Army installations by 2035.

Also in December 2020, ASA (IEE) published the Army Installation Energy and Water Strategic Plan .  Its  goal is to ensure that Army installation energy and water supplies are resilient, efficient, and affordable. Resiliency will be achieved through microgrids, energy storage, onsite generation,  backup  generation,  and  hardened  and  redundant  utilities and infrastructure. New tools and management systems, and improved design and equipment, will increase these systems' efficiency. A resilience assessment showed that ten of the twenty-nine installations designated as Power Projection Platforms or Mobilization Force Generation Installations  reported  unacceptable  risk  to  sustaining  critical  missions from  energy  or  water  issues.  At  the  close  of  FY  2021,  the  Office  of Energy  Initiatives  was  working  on  eleven  operational  and  thirty-eight in-progress projects at thirty-two installations. Projects at twenty-one of the installations were designed to provide an 'island-able' capability to power critical missions in the event of a power outage. At the close of FY 2021, the Office of Energy Initiatives had eleven operational projects with a further thirty-eight projects in development at thirty-two installations. The office's eleven operational projects have a total production capability of more than 325 megawatts.

In  September  2021,  the  G-9  established  the  Army  Control  System Governance  Office,  which  will  improve  the  governance,  oversight,  and resilience  of  the  control  systems  in  critical  infrastructure,  installation public works, power grids, energy systems, weapons, manufacturing, and medical systems.

A September 2021 Army directive established policy for identifying, reporting, responding to, and providing treatment, counseling, rehabilitation,  follow-up,  and  other  services  to  children  and  youth  who exhibit problematic sexual behavior on Army installations. These services are  also  available  to  family  members  who  have  been  affected  by  these behaviors. The directive required installations to create multidisciplinary teams to identify risk factors and address the safety, medical, behavioral health, academic, and social needs of the children and youth involved in such incidents.

## Housing, Construction, and Infrastructure

The Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) is the Army's partnership with private companies to build and maintain almost all on-post family

housing. A public scandal in FY 2019-which exposed these companies as failing to provide required maintenance and repair services and showed that they frequently disregarded tenant complaints-resulted in an Office of the Inspector General review of the RCI. As a consequence, Congress included in the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act a 'Tenant Bill of Rights' that listed eighteen rights for military service members and their families who reside in privatized housing on military installations.

The G-9 implemented the Tenant Bill of Rights at thirty-seven of the forty-four installations with privatized housing by June 2021 and at the rest by the end of September. ASA (IEE) continued a multiyear review of all RCI projects in the Army portfolio to validate portions of RCI program financial  statements  and  operating  expenses.  Seven  RCI  projects  were audited during FY 2021. ASA (IEE) has seven audits per year scheduled for four more years. The RCI program received a capital infusion of $2.8 billion for the construction of 3,800 homes and the renovation of 18,000 houses on Army installations across the country over the next five years. The service set a goal to have no families living in failing on-post housing by the end of FY 2024. In August 2021, the G-9 published the Portfolio Asset Management Handbook Version 6.1 , which incorporates the requirements of the Army Housing Campaign Plan , reinforces oversight responsibilities, and  includes  updated  training,  quality  assurance,  and  environmental hazard requirements at all echelons.

Although the  COVID-19 pandemic continued, companies working for  the  Army  adjusted  their  maintenance  and  construction  practices  to allow  mostly  unimpeded  progress  of  building  projects  on  installations. During FY 2021, the Army completed twenty-eight new and renovated building projects that achieved certification as environmentally sustainable by  the  U.S.  Green  Building  Council.  They  included  emergency  services centers, fire stations, readiness centers, training support centers, battalion operation  buildings,  warehouses,  dental  clinics,  dining  facilities,  canine facilities, and unmanned aerial systems buildings.

The  Army  also  worked  to  repair  or  replace  failing  barracks  during the fiscal year. In FY 2020, the service reviewed its approximately 6,700 barracks and determined that almost all installations with barracks had at least one with the lowest ratings of Quality 3 or Quality 4. At the start of FY 2021, the Army announced an initiative to upgrade its barracks that will cost $9.6 billion through FY 2030. The goal is to have no barracks rated as Quality 3 or Quality 4 by 2030.

As COVID-19 restrictions lifted during the fiscal year, travel patterns slowly normalized. This benefited privatized Army lodging as occupancy increased from 56.3 percent in FY 2020 to 67.3 percent in FY 2021, a number which is close to the usually budgeted 72.2 percent. As cash flow became  more  consistent,  the  privatized  Army  lodging  lessee  met  the

performance thresholds required to remove the constraints imposed by the lender on development expenditures. A two-building hotel opened at Fort Jackson, South Carolina; construction resumed on a new hotel at Aberdeen Proving Ground; and renovations of existing hotels restarted Army-wide. Hotel services remained subject to restrictions and staffing shortages,  however,  and  inflation  became  a  concern.  A  Government Accountability Office study released in February 2021 reported that since beginning to privatize its domestic on-post hotels in 1996, the Army had made  many  improvements,  including  replacing  lodging  facilities  with newly  constructed  hotels.  However,  improvements  took  longer  than anticipated, development plans changed, and the service did not include key information about delays and alterations in its reports to Congress. Beginning in July 2021, Operation Allies Welcome used a hotel at Fort Lee to house Afghan refugees.

In  August 2021, the Army announced that sites in Europe that had been designated for closure and return to the host nation instead would be retained by U.S. Army Europe and Africa. Growth requirements in the command were outpacing facility construction and renovation at Barton Barracks,  Pulaski  Barracks,  Coleman  Barracks,  Weilimdorf  Warehouse, and the Amelia Earhart Center in Germany as well as Caserne Daumerie in Belgium.

## Public Affairs

The Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA) did not issue an Army communication plan for FY 2021, as it continued to adapt to the constraints the pandemic placed on communicating the Army story. Aligning with the Army Campaign Plan , OCPA messaging focused on people, readiness, and modernization.

Despite  the  constraints  of  the  first  virtual program,  OCPA  led another  successful  annual  meeting  of  the  Association  of  the  United States Army. While highlighting the event's theme, ' America's Army and its People: Transforming for the Future, ' OCPA also provided important communication guidance to public affairs professionals about the Army Installations Strategy and the Army Arctic Strategy .

OCPA regional offices in Chicago, Illinois (Midwest), New York, New York (Northeast), and Los Angeles, California (West), continued to build public support for the Army. OCPA West created 'JOE Talks,' a virtual speaker series, allowing Army leaders to encourage Army representation in entertainment, film, and television. The 'Meet Your Army' community outreach  initiative  continued,  but  the  COVID-19  pandemic  restricted most of its events to virtual appearances.

The  Army  issued  a  major  revision  to  Army  Regulation  360-1, The Army Public Affairs Program , in October 2020. Changes included updated Title  10  authorizations  of  public  affairs,  social  media  and  digital  media roles and functions, revised procedures for avoiding the release of critical information during ongoing criminal investigations, and a new directive for Army flyovers for public affairs missions. The revision placed special emphasis on dissemination of information, social media, and countering misinformation and disinformation.

In FY  2021,  an  employee  survey  of  OCPA  revealed  significant command climate issues. In September 2021, the Army suspended the chief of  public  affairs  from  her  position.  Additionally,  evidence  emerged  that several systemic problems in the public affairs program had contributed to the command crisis at OCPA, including a lack of funding, insufficient authority, and outdated practices. A Department of the Army Inspector General inquiry will continue into FY 2022.

## Legislative Liaison

During FY 2021, the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison coordinated visits by forty-four congressional delegations and seventy-nine congressional staff delegations to sites in the United States and overseas. It managed  more  than  9,000  written congressional inquiries from members  of  Congress  and  assisted  Army  senior  leaders  in  preparing

for  their  congressional  testimony.  The  insurrection  at  the  Capitol  in January 2021 triggered hearings by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration,  and  the  House  Committee  on  Oversight  and  Reform about the DoD and the HQDA responses to requests for activating the D.C. National Guard on that day. The independent review of conditions at Fort Hood released in December 2020 resulted in additional hearings by the House Armed Services Committee's Military Personnel Subcommittee and  a  congressional  delegation  escorted  by  legislative  liaisons  in  May 2021  to  assess  the  situation  at  the  installation.  The  office  continued  to seek congressional support for Army initiatives including updated sexual harassment and sexual assault policies, the Army Combat Fitness Test, and military health system reforms. During Operation Allies Welcome, the office provided liaison staff at six installations to support the Department of Homeland Security, facilitating more than a dozen congressional and congressional staff delegation visits.

## Chaplain Corps

COVID-19  restrictions  continued  to  present  major  difficulties for chaplains  in  FY  2021.  The  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Chaplains  (OCCH)

maintained  virtual  worship  services  broadcast  over  the  internet  and exercised  safety  precautions  for  in-person  gatherings.  A  digital  giving platform yielded $1.1 million in donations to support religious programs across 54 military communities. OCCH started a new peer-review process for the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps Journal to improve its quality.

In  FY  2021,  the  Chaplain  Corps  continued  the  Spiritual  Readiness Initiative begun in the previous fiscal year. Spiritual readiness has taken on more significance as part of the Army's Holistic Health and Fitness program, which promotes a body-mind-spirit approach to building peak performance in soldiers. The Army defines spiritual readiness as the development of the personal qualities needed to respond to life's stressors, adversity, and hardship. Spirituality encompasses both organized religion and nontheistic views and concepts.  In  collaboration  with  the  Army's  Behavioral  Health  program, OCCH conducted Spiritual Readiness Initiative events at eleven locations, with attendance by 1,981 command team members, 524 behavioral health providers, 534 drill sergeants, and 642 unit ministry team members.

During FY 2021, OCCH spent $34 million on Strong Bonds, a chaplainled program that trains soldiers and their families to build and maintain good  personal  relationships.  Revisions  to  Strong  Bonds  provided  more flexibility, personal instruction, and choice by granting more independence at regional and local levels and by empowering unit ministry teams. In FY 2021, the program held 1,124 events with 33,500 participants for the RA, 244 events with 8,900 participants for the ARNG, and 75 events with 1,600 participants for the Reserve.

For  the  first  time  in  more  than  a  decade,  the  number  of  applicants accepted  into  the  Chaplain  Corps  increased  for  a  second  consecutive year. During FY 2021, OCCH selected 120 chaplains for the RA, 66 for the ARNG, and 120 for the Reserve, plus another 199 chaplain candidates for the ARNG and Reserve. OCCH implemented the full integration of all RA chaplain assignments using the Total Officer Personnel Management Information  System,  an  important  step  in  aligning  the  Chaplain  Corps with the Army personnel system.

## Safety

The Army lost 104 soldiers and 2 civilian employees to accident-related fatalities in FY 2021. The U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center (USACRC) concluded that this overall increase from the previous year was attributable partially  to  the  loosening  of  COVID-19  restrictions  as  the  pandemic progressed, resulting in more off-duty mishaps. However, the Army had only nineteen on-duty fatalities, the fewest ever reported.

There were 122 Class A accidents in FY 2021. Class A accidents involve fatalities, permanent disabilities, $2 million or more of property damage,

or loss of an Army aircraft. Only seventeen of these accidents were on-duty, compared to the previous historic  low  of  twenty-four  on-duty  Class  A accidents in FY 2020. In FY 2021, for the second year in a row, Army Aviation remained below the rate of one Class A flight mishap per 100,000 flight hours of crewed aircraft. The MQ-1C Gray Eagle drone program had nine Class A mishaps for a rate of 11.42 mishaps per 100,000 flight hours.  The  RQ-7B  Shadow  drone  program  experienced  eight  Class  B and twenty-two Class C mishaps, with a Class B mishap rate of 23.86 per 100,000 flight hours.

The USACRC's '4th-Quarter Aviation Spike' engagement campaign, which started in March 2020, continued through FY 2021. Whereas there were four Class A flight mishaps in the fourth quarter in FY 2017, four in FY 2018, and five in FY 2019, there was only one in FY 2020 and none in FY 2021. Its '3rd-Quarter Tactical Vehicle Spike' engagement campaign started in January 2021. During the previous five years, the Army had an average of six Class A tactical vehicle mishaps per year in the third quarter, but the service experienced only one in FY 2021.

The  USACRC  launched  three  new  systems  to  improve  safety during  FY  2021.  In  December  2020,  the  Occupational  Safety  and Health  Administration  (OSHA)  Corner  opened.  This  online  portal enables  users  to  report  OSHA-related  events  and  violations  and  to view statistics, reports, and other resources. The OSHA Corner helped increase  communication  between  USACRC  and  Army  safety  and occupational  health  professionals  regarding  inspections,  violations, and  appeals.  In  March  2021,  SafetyNet  went  live.  This  online  Army safety and  occupational  health platform encouraged  professional dialogue and the exchange of loss-prevention information across the many and varied systems employed in Army formations.   Concurrently, USACRC  fully  released  the  Army  Safety  Management  Information System-although all modules will not be finished until FY 2024. This application  is  a  'system  of  systems'  consisting  of  five  modules  that encompass the continuous process of assessing potential exposures and health effects in various environments across the Army.

During  FY  2021,  in  conjunction  with  USACRC,  the  Office  of the  Director  of  Army  Safety  conducted  four  special-interest  surveys of  ammunition,  explosives,  and  chemical  agents.  The  office  did  not undertake  any  similar  reviews  of  infectious  agents  and  toxins  because of  the  ongoing transition of a large number of Army infectious agents. The  office  completed  the  inspections  at  Fort  Bragg  in  February  2021; Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, in April; Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, North Carolina, in June; and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, in July. The total was double that of FY 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic had curtailed special-interest surveys.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  operated  more than 4,900 facilities  on  military  installations  in  the  United  States  and thirty  other  countries  in  FY  2021.  These  included  department  and convenience stores, restaurants, malls, movie theaters, and gas stations. Approximately  60  percent  of  AAFES  earnings  went  to  support  DoD quality-of-life  programs  at  military  installations  around  the  globe. AAFES  employed  35,000  associates,  85  percent  of  whom  had  some connection  to  the  military,  including  45  percent  who  were  veterans, military spouses, or dependents. The sale of goods and services funded most of the operating budget; federal appropriations provided 3 percent for  transporting  goods.  AAFES  maintained  COVID-19  restrictions at  exchanges  throughout  FY  2021,  requiring  employees  to  wear  face masks; retaining acrylic shields at checkout counters, customer service areas,  and  restaurants;  and  regularly  disinfecting  high-traffic  areas. Moreover, expanded restaurant delivery and takeout services, begun in FY 2020 because of the pandemic, continued in FY 2021, as did delivery of supplies to quarantined customers.

DoD acted to increase the customer base for AAFES-as well as for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard exchange services. The number of core customers for AAFES had dwindled since the end of the Cold War. Additionally, the growth of online retail presented a continually increasing challenge.  It  was  prudent  to  expand  access  to  exchanges  to  maintain profitability and secure AAFES's future. On 1 May 2021, DoD authorized all  DoD and Coast Guard appropriated-fund and nonappropriated-fund civilian  employees  (excluding  contractors)  to  shop  at  exchanges  in  the United  States  and  U.S.  territories  and  possessions.  The  new  shopping access did not include permission to purchase military uniforms, tobacco products, or alcohol.

AAFES implemented initiatives  to  increase  its  competitiveness.  In November 2020, it partnered with an online platform to manage profiles of more than 20,000 suppliers across many categories, allowing AAFES vendors to showcase products and giving exchange customers access to a wider range of products. In February 2021, AAFES announced a pilot program offering chiropractic services to active duty members, retirees, disabled veterans, and their families. Chiropractic offices opened at six installations.  Moreover,  AAFES  added  7  durable  medical  equipment shops  and  8  dental  offices  to  its  existing  139  optical  and  optometry clinics, 17 durable medical equipment shops, and 9 dental offices. From February to March, AAFES's first vendor-submission campaign focused on  recruiting  businesses  offering  American-made  camping  products, sporting goods, and linens. In April, AAFES partnered with a group of

military spouses and veterans to launch the National Diversity Veteran Small Business eMarketplace.

AAFES phased out 'pogs' after nearly twenty years of use. Pogs are cardboard or plastic disks that are lighter than metallic coins, so they are less expensive to ship overseas. AAFES started using pogs in Afghanistan in November 2001 as a temporary fix to a shortage of coins. Plain pogs evolved into decorated collectables bearing the images of soldiers, aircraft, comic book characters, and sports celebrities. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan  caused  AAFES  to  close  the  last  exchanges  in  the  country, ending the use of pogs in September 2021.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The  Army's  Family  and  MWR  program  provides  family,  child,  and youth programs and recreation, sports, entertainment, travel, and leisure activities  to  soldiers,  Army  families,  and  retirees.  It  oversees  libraries, dining facilities, movie theaters, fitness centers, swimming pools, bowling alleys,  golf  courses,  childcare  centers,  and  youth centers. MWR services includes  arts  and  crafts  programs,  travel  programs,  outdoor  recreation services, concerts and entertainment, sports and fitness programs, tutoring and  educational  support,  babysitter  training,  childcare  fee  assistance, automotive maintenance and training, financial services, relocation planning, and employment assistance. DoD expanded shopping privileges at  MWR  facilities  to  all  DoD  and  Coast  Guard  appropriated-fund  and nonappropriated-fund civilian employees at the same time as it extended access to AAFES exchanges.

MWR services became even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic as soldiers and their families needed them more than ever. Army Community Service kept financial readiness and employment readiness programs  open  for  in-person  business  and  provided  virtual  services. With  the  spread  of  COVID-19,  heightened  stress,  school  closures,  loss of  income,  and  social  isolation  increased  the  risk  for  domestic  abuse, child  abuse  and  neglect,  and  problematic  sexual  behavior  in  children and youth. The Army Community Service's Family Advocacy Program's prevention services and clinics stayed open for in-person business. DoD's Military OneSource website added content specific to family relationships, parenting, teen stress, and similar issues. The G-9 began a youth outreach initiative  to  increase  youth  development  opportunities  for  ARNG  and Reserve  families.  Consequently,  the  ARNG  and  the  Reserve  established their first affiliations with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.

The Army started construction on two large child development centers in Hawaii and Alaska, and it drew up plans to build six more that should open in FY 2023. Each one will have a 348-person capacity. All existing

child development centers remained open, but operated at reduced capacity, typically at 50 to 75 percent of pre-COVID-19 capacity, to reduce spread of the virus. In addition to other measures to improve quality, availability, and affordability of childcare, direct care staff received a pay increase as part of a DoD-wide effort to retain such valuable employees.

The  G-9  revised  three  regulations  related  to  MWR  operations.  It published  Army  Regulation  210-7, Personal  Commercial  Solicitation on  Army  Installations ,  in  May  2021.  Army  Regulation  210-25, Vending Facility Program for the Blind on Federal Property ,  and Army Regulation 215-4, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting , appeared in June. The first two made some changes to responsibilities, incorporated new DoD directives, and added internal control evaluations. The final publication transferred nonappropriated-fund contracting authority and oversight from MWR to U.S. Army Installation Management Command, removed restrictions and exclusions from the ARNG and Reserve, incorporated the updated Buy American Act, expanded contract types, increased competition thresholds, and made other alterations.

MWR  organized  the  36th  Army  Ten-Miler,  virtual  edition,  on 11-18 October 2020. MWR had to abandon plans to host the traditional race in Washington, D.C., because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so for the first time teams participated by running routes at locations around the nation and submitting run progress and times to an app. The event was capped at 25,000 participants.

## Special Functions

## Surgeon General

The Office of the Surgeon General is responsible for all health and medical matters of the Army, including the medical aspects of training, organizing, and  equipping  the  Army.  The  surgeon  general  is  also  the  commanding general of U.S. Army Medical Command.

In  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Acts  of  FY  2017  and  FY 2019, Congress directed the military services to eliminate what it saw as duplicated services and establish a single, integrated military healthcare system by transferring control of medical treatment facilities to the Defense Health Agency. In April 2020, the deputy secretary of defense paused all transition activities because of the unprecedented burden the COVID-19 pandemic was placing  on  the  Defense  Health  Agency  and  the  services' medical organizations. This pause remained in effect through the end of FY 2020. In November 2020, DoD resumed transition activities. The Army completed its transfer of medical treatment facilities and dental treatment facilities to the Defense Health Agency by the end of FY 2021.

The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  of  FY  2017  also  directed the  secretary  of  defense,  in  collaboration  with  the  secretaries  of  the military departments, to define the medical and dental military personnel requirements  necessary  for  the  operational  medical  force.  It  authorized DoD  to  convert  a  military  medical  or  dental  position  to  a  civilian medical or dental position if the secretary of defense determined that the military position was not necessary for the operational medical force. The Department of the Army reviewed its operational medical requirements against the 2018 National Defense Strategy .  This  review determined that 6,935 positions within the Army's medical and dental treatment facilities could  be  converted  from  military  personnel  to  civilian  personnel.  The National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2020, however, directed DoD to limit the reduction of military medical personnel in medical and dental treatment  facilities  and  to  review  potential  gaps  in  healthcare  services. In response to this directive, the Army in FY 2021 reassessed its earlier determination and decided to convert only 2,948 positions from military to  civilian.  Each  of  these  positions  is  either  a  currently  vacant  military authorization filled with a civilian over-hire or one in a healthcare market where there is high confidence the service can hire a civilian to fill it.

In  FY  2020,  HQDA  instituted  the  COVID-19  Volunteer  Recall program, to allow retired personnel to volunteer for service in response to

the pandemic. A total of 232 retired Army medical personnel responded. Out of these, eighty-two continued to serve through extensions beyond the original orders' end date. At the end of FY 2021, twenty-two volunteers remain on active duty and are expected to serve through June 2022.

In FY 2020, the Army began reorganizing the Warrior Care and Transition Program into the Army Recovery Care Program. As part of that process, the fourteen warrior transition battalions were reorganized and redesignated as soldier  recovery  units.  The  effort  culminated  on  1  October  2020  when  the soldier recovery units achieved full operational capability. These units provide complex case management for those wounded, ill, or injured soldiers requiring this type of care. During FY 2021, the units served 773 soldiers.

## Army Audit Agency

The Army Audit Agency provides independent internal auditing services for all Army operations and programs. It maintains an operations center at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and sixteen field offices-thirteen in the continental United States and one each in Germany, Hawaii, and South Korea. The Army Audit Agency developed a strategic plan for FY 2022 through FY 2026 to continue its evolution into a more responsive organization capable of operating in any environment. The plan emphasizes the increased use of telework and dispersed teams as well as the adoption of new technology and data analytics.

The  agency  published  eighty  audit  reports  during  FY  2021  that identified  more  than  $4  billion  in  potential  savings.  Its  most  significant findings in FY 2021 came in its evaluation of the reimbursement system used  for  Army  IT  purchases.  Army  commands  frequently  failed  to  use official reimbursement systems when acquiring IT, purchased unauthorized IT, and failed to accurately report IT costs. Updating purchase policies and implementing monthly reports could save the service up to $3.62 billion.

Agency audits helped to improve Army readiness and performance. An evaluation of the Occupational Physical Assessment Test found that the series of exercises that made up the test did not contribute to decreasing injury and attrition rates. Comparing rates of physical injury before and after the test's implementation showed that training injury rates actually had increased.  The  agency  recommended that TRADOC reevaluate the test's  physical  fitness  categories  and  training  difficulty  levels  as  well  as establish a formalized process to regularly monitor test data.

## Office of Army Cemeteries

The Office of Army Cemeteries (OAC) formulates and oversees policies, doctrine, plans, and standards for Army  cemeteries. It establishes

Land reclamation work at the West Point cemetery

and  maintains  gravesite  accountability; provides  technical guidance, training,  staff  assistance,  and  inspections;  adjudicates  burial  exceptions, disinterments, and expansion requests; and handles other issues of concern at Army cemeteries.

During  FY  2021,  OAC  conducted  384  interments  and  inurnments at  eleven  Army  post  cemeteries.  It  concluded  five  inspections  of  Army cemeteries. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, OAC conducted two virtual cemetery responsible official courses credentialing forty students. In August 2021, OAC resumed meetings of the joint working group with the Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration and the American Battle  Monuments  Commission  after  a  three-year  hiatus.  The  working group agreed to add the National Park Service as a member during 2022 and formed subcommittees dedicated to training and memorialization.

Land  reclamation  work  continued  at  the  West  Point  Cemetery  to extend the longevity of the site. The project was 60 percent complete at the end of the fiscal year, and completion is expected in FY 2022. It will add nearly 3,500 gravesites to the cemetery.

In Pennsylvania, the Carlisle Barracks Disinterment Program continued its work to exhume the remains of Native American children that died at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and return them to their tribes. COVID-19 prevented the planned return of the remains of nine children to the Rosebud Sioux

Tribe of South Dakota and one Aleut native to St. Peters Island in FY 2020. OAC completed their return in FY 2021 and plans to return the remains of another six to ten children to families and tribes in FY 2022.

Arlington  National  Cemetery  had  6,037  interments  in  FY  2021, compared  to 4,800 services conducted in FY  2020. Infrastructure improvements  included  the  rebuilding  of  roads  and  storm  water  lines, and the completion of the Pershing Drive area of the cemetery. Arlington National  Cemetery  finished  the  first  phase  of  restoration  work  on  the Memorial  Amphitheater's  exterior  doors  and  made  significant  progress on the second phase, which will involve cleaning the structure's exterior, masonry repairs, and construction of an accessibility ramp.

## Civil Works

In April 2021, the Army signed a project partnership agreement with the South Florida Water Management District for the Everglades Agricultural Area phase of the Central Everglades Planning Project, part of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration program. The project will create a 10,500acre  reservoir  that  will  store  240,000  acre-feet  of  water  when  filled  to capacity and will allow approximately 370,000 additional acre-feet of new water  to  move  through  the  Central  Everglades  on  average  per  year.  In September, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded the first contract for the project.

In June 2021, the Corps  of Engineers  and  the  Environmental Protection  Agency  announced  a  joint  rulemaking  process  to  develop revisions to 'Waters of the United States, ' which defines the scope of waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. This action is in accordance with an executive order issued in January 2021 by President Biden directing agencies to review certain environmental rules developed under the previous administration. In FY 2020, the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency had published, in accordance with a 2017 presidential executive order, the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. It narrowed the scope of waters and wetlands that were considered waters of the United States.

In  FY  2021,  the  Corps  of  Engineers  completed  the  second  of  three phases for the Boston Harbor Dredging project. The project will enable the harbor to handle large container ships. In September 2021, the Corps of Engineers awarded the first construction contract for the Upper Ohio Navigation project. The project will replace three locks on the Ohio River with larger ones.

The  Corps  of  Engineers  responded  to  several  hurricanes  during FY 2021. One of the most important services was Operation Blue Roof, in which contractors installed reinforced plastic sheeting on roofs damaged

by  hurricanes.  Other  missions  included  emergency  power  installation, supporting temporary housing facilities, conducting infrastructure assessments, and providing debris removal assistance to state governments.

## Environmental Protection

In  March  2021,  the  secretary  of  defense  established  a  climate  change working  group  for  coordinating  the  DoD's  response  to  a  presidential executive order designating climate change as a threat to national security. In  turn,  HQDA  established  the  Army  Climate  Change  Working  Group under  the  ASA  (IEE).  This  working  group  brings  together  150  Army leaders and subject matter experts to prepare the Army Climate Strategy and the Army Climate Action .

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of humanmade chemicals that have been used in many applications worldwide since the 1950s, including in the firefighting foam used on military installations. In 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a lifetime health advisory for perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in drinking water. In  FY  2020,  the  Army  established  the  Army  PFAS  Working  Group  and subsequently created the joint ASA (IEE)/G-9 governance structure. The working group is the centralized, integrated policy and guidance directive body to address PFAS across the Army. In FY 2021, it created a subgroup that worked with the ASA (IEE) to establish websites for posting the Army's PFAS water-testing data. In FY 2021, the Army added nine new installations to the inventory of locations where it is conducting assessments of PFAS use or potential release. At the end of the fiscal year, the service had conducted assessments  at  337  installations.  Seventy-five  preliminary  assessments or site inspections were completed, with fifty-three of those requiring no further action. Twenty-seven remedial investigations were underway, and an additional fifty-nine were planned. Investigations identified the impact of off-installation PFAS to drinking water at three installations. The Army took action to provide alternate water to affected off-installation residences and is working toward implementing long-term solutions.

## Chemical Weapons Demilitarization

The  chemical  weapons  demilitarization  program  eliminates  chemical warfare materiel in accordance with obligations specified in the Chemical Weapons  Convention.  The  program  destroyed  nearly  90  percent  of  the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile in 2012 and then dismantled and closed the  associated  chemical  weapons  destruction  facilities  over  a  three-year period. The remaining stockpiles of this materiel are at Pueblo Chemical Depot, Colorado, and Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky.

Operators place a 155-mm. projectile containing VX nerve agent in a tray to begin the destruction process at the Blue Grass Army Depot.

<!-- image -->

Destruction  of  blister-agent-filled  105-mm.  howitzer  projectiles began at Pueblo Chemical Depot in December 2020. Blue Grass Army Depot  completed  destruction  of  blister-agent-filled  155-mm.  howitzer projectiles using the static detonation chamber in September 2021. Blue Grass  Army  Depot  destroyed  all  its  VX-nerve-agent-filled  155-mm. howitzer  projectiles  between  January  and  May  2021.  The  depot  then started  destroying  VX-nerve-agent-filled  M-55  rockets  in  July.  By  the end of FY 2021, the program had destroyed 70.9 percent of the chemical agents  at  the  two  depots.  The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for Fiscal Year 2016 set 31 December 2023 as the deadline for destruction of all U.S. chemical weapons.

## Provost Marshal General

In September 2021, an Army directive updated policies, procedures, and planning guidance for detainee operations during armed conflict and other military operations. It required Army commands to be in compliance with DoD Directive 2310.01E, DoD Detainee Program ,  within 180 days of the directive's  publication.  This  ensured  that  units  are  prepared  to  conduct effective  and  lawful  detainee  operations.  It  also  directed  the  provost marshal general to incorporate its provisions into Army Regulation 190-8, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees, and Other Detainees , within two years.

In May 2021, the Department of Defense Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission awarded accreditation status to the Military Police School's 31A Basic Officer Leader Course, 31B Military Police One Station Unit Training, and the Army Civilian Police Academy. Accreditation means a  course's  core  law  enforcement  curriculum  is  aligned  to  international standards  and  best  practices.  Additionally,  in  August,  the  American Correctional Association reaccredited for the third time the school's 31E Corrections Specialist Course.

In  FY  2021,  limits  on  school  capacity  created  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic  continued  to  affect  the  training  of  Department  of  the  Army civilian police officers. The provost marshal general extended a temporary waiver  for  initial  training  standards  of  new  civilian  police  officers  until December 2021. The waiver permitted commands to hire police officers who possess certain experience criteria before these people attended the Military Police School's Civilian Police Academy.

In FY 2021, 264 deserters were returned to military control. Seven of these were on the Army's most wanted fugitive list. At the end of the fiscal year, the Army's Deserter Apprehension program had 1,001 active warrants for alleged deserters. Seventeen of these soldiers were on the Army's most wanted fugitive list.

## Legal

A judge advocate is a commissioned officer certified by the judge advocate general to practice law in the Army. The Judge Advocate General Corps in FY 2021 had 1,817 judge advocates in the active component, 2,608 judge advocates in the reserve components, and 764 civilian attorneys. Women were nearly 29 percent of all active  duty  judge  advocates,  and  minority officers  accounted for almost 20 percent of the Judge Advocate General Corps' active duty attorney strength. FY 2021 was the fiftieth anniversary of the Judge Advocate General Corps Summer Internship Program. More than seventy law students participated in six to eight week paid internships at  Army installations in the United States during which they assisted in providing legal services in all legal fields. The interns are an essential talent pool, as most of them apply for and are selected to join the Judge Advocate General Corps.

During  FY  2021,  the  Judge  Advocate  General  Corps  continued  the defense  investigators  pilot  program  mandated  in  the  FY  2020  National Defense  Authorization  Act.  Defense  investigators  assist  trial  defense service  judge  advocates.  In  FY  2021,  the  corps  hired  four  investigators, bringing the number in the program to ten.

In FY 2021, 315 records of trial and more than 900 motions and briefs were referred to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA) for judicial

review. Of those 315 cases, ACCA received 286 for the first time (not a remand  from  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Armed  Forces  or  returned from the convening authority after remand). It processed two cases under pre-Military  Justice  Act  of  2016  procedures  involving  a  promulgating order.  The  court  processed  the  other  284  cases  under  Military  Justice Act  of  2016  procedures  involving  an  entry  of  judgement.  For  the  two pre-Military Justice Act of 2016 cases, the average processing time from sentencing to convening authority action was 371days. In both of these cases, the convening authority did not complete the initial action within the 120 days prescribed by United States v. Moreno . ACCA received one of these records within thirty days of convening authority action. In 204 of the 284 Military Justice Act cases, ACCA completed the certification of the record of trial within 120 days. ACCA received 192 of the Military Justice Act cases within thirty days of the completion of certification of the record of trial or entry of judgement. ACCA rendered an initial decision in 337 cases in FY 2021, with an average processing time of 243 days from receipt of the record of trial by the clerk of court to decision by ACCA. Of the 337 decisions, ACCA issued 330 within the eighteen-month period prescribed by United States v. Moreno .

In FY 2021, military judges of the Army Trial Judiciary presided over 705 original  courts-martial,  a  3  percent  decrease  from  FY  2020.  Of  the cases tried in FY 2021, 193 were fully contested, 74 involved mixed pleas, 292 were guilty pleas, and 146 were terminated prior to findings. In 271 of  these  cases,  findings  included  sexual  misconduct-related  offenses,  a 10 percent increase from FY 2020.

At the end of FY 2021, the Army had 745 pending courts-martial cases, 17 of which were referred for trial by courts-martial, with the remainder pending disposition decisions. Tables 14 through 19 present data on cases completed in FY 2021.

## Historical Activities

The National Museum of the United States Army is a 185,500-square-foot building  at  Fort  Belvoir,  Virginia,  containing  eleven  galleries  displaying nearly  1,400  artifacts.  The  museum  is  a  joint  effort  between  the  service and the Army Historical Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The Army Historical  Foundation  constructed  the  building  with  private  funds.  The Army  provided  the  infrastructure,  roads,  utilities,  and  exhibit  work. The Army owns and manages the museum. The service had planned to open the museum in FY 2020 but postponed the opening because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The museum opened in November 2020, but a surge in the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated its closure shortly thereafter. It maintained several online programs, however, including book talks and virtual field trips. With the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, the museum reopened on the Army's birthday, 14 June 2021.

The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  2021  directed  the secretary of defense to establish a commission related to the assignment, modification,  or  removal  of  names,  symbols,  displays,  monuments,  and paraphernalia  of  DoD  assets  that  commemorate  the  Confederate  States of  America or any person who served voluntarily with the Confederate States  of  America.  The  act  requires  the  secretary  of  defense,  not  later than  three  years  after  the  date  of  its  enactment,  to  implement  the  plan submitted by the commission for removing from all DoD assets anything that honors or commemorates the Confederate States of America or any person who served voluntarily with the Confederate States  of  America. During FY 2021, the Army supplied the commission with a small staff for administrative and logistical support. Additionally, the Center of Military History provided the commission with historical support.

The Institute of Heraldry furnishes heraldic services to the Executive Office of the President, DoD,  and  all other federal agencies. On 25  September  2021,  the  building  housing  the  institute  sustained  a catastrophic  mechanical  failure  that  terminated  the  occupancy  of  the building because of the loss of electricity, climate control, water, and fire suppression control. The failure included a water leak that flooded part of the building. By the end of FY 2021, the institute remained unable to

carry out its presidential-support mission and had only a limited capability for  quality  assurance  reviews  and  shipping  and  receiving  of  industrial tools  needed  for  the  manufacturing  of  insignia.  The  flood  submerged approximately 30 percent of the steel dies needed to make military insignia and heraldic products. By the end of FY 2021, remediation processes had stabilized  the  corrosive  effects  of  the  water  permeation,  but  much  work remained to restore the tools to their preflood condition.

## 10 Conclusion

In  FY  2021,  the  COVID-19  pandemic's  effects  on  the  Army  lessened with  the  use  of  mitigation  measures  developed  in  FY  2020  and  the arrival  of  vaccines.  Soldiers,  especially  from  the  ARNG,  continued  to aid civil authorities, most notably in supporting vaccination efforts. The virus's  mutation  into  a  more  transmissible  variant  and  the  decision  by many Americans to refuse vaccination, however, meant that COVID-19 remained  a  threat  throughout  FY  2021.  The  requirement  that  Army personnel be vaccinated came late in the fiscal year, so the full effectiveness of this tool in easing this threat would not be in place until FY 2022.

Army units continued to support combatant commands, but FY 2021 brought  a  major  transition  to  the  Army  with  the  final  deployments  to Afghanistan. The American withdrawal from that country demonstrated again the value in maintaining Army forces able to rapidly deploy at short notice. Although the war continued for Afghans, the withdrawal brought an  end  to  the  Army's  longest  overseas  war.  As  had  occurred  in  1975, the service turned, in Operation Allies Refuge and Operation Allies Welcome, to helping those who had assisted its forces during the war.

The Army's reserve components undertook numerous tasks during FY 2021. They aided civil authorities in pandemic response and disaster relief operations. Units mobilized and deployed overseas to support combatant commands. The ARNG and the USAR continued preparing for large-scale combat operations. The major difference, compared to FY 2020, was the insurrection on 6 January 2021 at the U.S. Capitol, followed by the largest deployment of ARNG units to Washington, D.C., since militia regiments deployed there in 1861 to defend the city against the rebellious states.

During  FY  2021,  as  part  of  its  modernization  efforts,  the  service invested considerable resources in implementing The Army People Strategy , published in FY 2020. It continued improving talent management, sought to promote greater inclusion, worked to decrease the number of suicides, and took action to raise the quality of life for soldiers and their families. At the same time, the Army established the People First Task Force to revise policies, processes, and programs in line with the Fort Hood Independent Review Committee's findings and recommendations.

Other  aspects  of  modernization  also  advanced  during  FY  2021. Publications  from  the  chief  of  staff  of  the  Army  and  from  AFC  refined the  service's  concepts  for  multidomain  operations  and  modernization. New doctrine and organizations marked the return of the division as the Army's decisive unit of action for large-scale combat operations. Exercises

held  in  the  combatant  commands  built  stronger  ties  with  partners  and examined  new  concepts.  The  service's  materiel  modernization  reached several  milestones,  most  notably  with  activation  of  its  first  hypersonic missile battery. The Army Installations Strategy described how the service will create modern, resilient, and sustainable installations.

The Army ended FY 2021 without an approved budget for FY 2022. The congressional continuing resolution that enabled the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2021 levels.
