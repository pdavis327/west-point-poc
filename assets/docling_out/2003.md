## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2003

## Introduction

Fiscal year (FY) 2003 was a pivotal year for the U.S. Army. Even as it laid the groundwork for a more distant future, the Army began to change in significant ways. The second year of the Global War on Terrorism that saw American troops fighting in two theaters spurred new initiatives and accelerated existing ones, as Army leaders adapted to meet short-term needs and learned to manage the practicalities and repercussions of large overseas commitments that would not soon end.

During  the  year,  the  Army  continued  to  supply  troops  for operations  in  Afghanistan  and,  after  building  up  a  sizable  force  in the Persian Gulf region, played a key role in defeating Iraq's military and ousting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The increasing violence against  American  soldiers  that  followed  the  end  of  major  combat operations,  however,  posed  challenges  for  Army  leaders  and  raised questions about the advisability of rapidly drawing down U.S. forces in Iraq as the administration of President George W . Bush had originally planned.  All  told,  the  Army  deployed  approximately  two-thirds  of its active and reserve combat formations during the fiscal year. More than twenty-four of the Army's thirty-three active component brigade combat teams and five of its reserve component enhanced separate brigades deployed.

To deal with the personnel requirements of the two conflicts, the Army issued stop-movement and stop-loss orders that kept thousands of soldiers from transferring to new duty stations or leaving the Army. Special  bonuses  retained  soldiers  needed  for  current  operations. During the summer, Army leaders announced that henceforth overseas unit deployments would last one year rather six months. Late in the year, the new U.S. Army chief of staff, General Peter J. Schoomaker, accelerated the implementation of a new unit manning initiative and began  restructuring  Army  forces  in  accordance  with  fundamentally different  force  design  concepts.  Throughout  the  year,  the  Army's morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  staff  shipped  sports  equipment, reading materials, and other supplies overseas for deployed soldiers and ran Family Assistance Centers and other services for the loved ones they left behind. Growing concerns about the impact of lengthy deployments on the mental health of soldiers led Army leaders to set up a new reintegration program and additional support services for

troops and their families. The Army also launched a ground-breaking mental  health  study  after  a  number  of  soldiers  in  Iraq  committed suicide.

At the same time, the Army achieved key objectives in a process that then Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki had set in motion in 1999 to transform the service to make the most of new technologies and respond to the changed conditions and requirements of a postCold  War  world.  The  Army  continued  to  reorganize,  establishing organizations to oversee Army installations, network operations, and contracting.  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command  certified  the  first  of  the service's new medium-weight units, the first Stryker brigade combat team, as ready to deploy. The Army also invested heavily in forwardlooking science and technology initiatives aimed at changing the way the Army's force of the future would operate. Most significantly, the service accomplished an important goal in its Future Combat Systems program, which was tasked with developing a networked system of vehicles, munitions, and sensors that would equip the Army's future combat units and help create a lighter, more rapidly deployable force. A favorable decision from the under secretary of defense permitted the  existing  science  and  technology  program  to  become  a  formal acquisition program.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Reorganizations and Realignments

FY 2003 brought significant changes in the senior leadership of the Department of the Army, as the service's top civilian official and top military  leader  both  departed.  On  25  April  2003,  Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White submitted his resignation at the request of Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. Following Secretary  White's  departure  on  9  May,  Under  Secretary  of  the Army Romie Leslie 'Les' Brownlee served as acting secretary of the Army. President George W. Bush nominated Secretary of the Air Force James G. Roche to succeed White; however, by the end of the fiscal year, the U.S. Senate had not yet confirmed Roche as the Army's new secretary.

On 11 June,  General  Shinseki's  term  as  chief  of  staff  of  the Army came to an end. During the weeks that followed, Vice Chief of Staff General John M. Keane served as acting chief. On 31 July, the Senate unanimously confirmed General Peter J. Schoomaker as General Shinseki's successor, and General Schoomaker was sworn in as the thirty-fifth chief of staff of the Army the next day. General Schoomaker had retired  from  the  Army  in  December  2000  after serving as the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. He returned to active duty at Secretary Rumsfeld's request.

In  keeping  with  the  service's  transformation  objectives,  Army leaders continued to implement a sweeping reorganization program initiated in FY 2001. In May 2001, Secretary White had created a Realignment  Task  Force  to  review  Army  organizations  and  offer recommendations for streamlining decision-making processes, improving  resource  management,  and  achieving  other  efficiencies. The task force worked in three phases. Phase I concentrated on the headquarters of the Department of the Army, Phase II on field operating agencies, and Phase III on major commands. The Army had begun carrying out many of the task force's Phase I recommendations in FY 2002, but FY 2003 also brought important changes.

In  accordance  with  General Orders 4 signed by Secretary White in August 2002, the Army activated the new Installation Management Agency (IMA) on 1 October 2002. Previously,  the  Army's  fifteen  major commands had been responsible for  providing  base  support,  and there were no common standards for garrison support, housing, or morale,  welfare,  and  recreation operations.  Consequently,  installation commanders often diverted sustainment, restoration, and maintenance  funds  to  augment insufficient  training  and  operational  funds,  which  resulted  in variable quality of life at installations. Army leaders now assigned responsibility for the service's 184 installations worldwide to the  IMA,  which  would  operate

Secretary White



through  seven  subordinate  regional  commands.  The  Army  established the new agency as a field operating agency under the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, with Maj. Gen. Anders B. Aadland as its first director. Its mission was to provide equitable, efficient, and effective management of all Army installations in order to support readiness; enable the well-being of soldiers, civilians, and family  members;  improve  infrastructure;  and  preserve  the  environment. With the new agency in place, the Army planned to transform its installation management operations gradually over several years.

On  1  October  2002,  the  Army  also  redesignated  the  U.S.  Army Signal  Command  as  the  Network  Enterprise  Technology  Command (NETCOM)/9th  Army  Signal  Command.  The  new  command  integrated tactical and strategic units from the Signal Command with major offices from the Army Chief Information Officer's staff and information management personnel from various Army commands and functional agencies. The Army established the new organization to create a single authority to operate and manage its information technology resources. NETCOM was to operate, maintain, and defend the service's communications networks and to assume responsibility for technically integrating the capabilities for command, control, communications, and computers



(C4)  throughout  the  Army.  Maj. Gen. James C. Hylton became the first commander  of  NETCOM, which was headquartered at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, but also maintained  a  strong  presence  in the National Capital Region.

Under Secretary Brownlee

Designed to work closely with both IMA and NETCOM was yet another  new  organization.  On  1 October  2002,  the  Army  formally activated the Army  Contracting Agency (ACA) as a field operating agency  under  the  Office  of  the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,  Logistics  and  Technology. The new agency took on a broad range of contracting-related responsibilities. It consolidated into  one  authority  all  contracting activities from the Military District of Washington, United States Military  Academy,  U.S.  Army  Forces

Command, U.S.  Army  Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  U.S.  Army Reserve  Command,  Seventh  Army,  Third  Army,  Eighth  Army,  U.S. Army South, and U.S. Army Pacific. It provided installation contracting for designated U.S. Army Materiel Command and U.S. Army Medical Command installations, the Army Chief Information Officer, NETCOM, and certain program executive offices. In support of the new IMA, the ACA supplied base operations contracting support for major installations  worldwide. The Army also assigned the agency responsibility for contingency contracting operations. A subordinate entity, the Information  Technology,  E-Commerce,  and  Commercial  Contracting  Center, was to handle purchasing of common-use information technology and commercial items for the entire Army. Army leaders expected the ACA to eliminate redundancies, improve the quality of Army contracts, ensure an emphasis on small businesses, consolidate purchasing to exploit economies of scale, and maximize efficiencies by reducing management overhead and realigning personnel.

Secretary  White  announced  reorganization  decisions  resulting from  the  realignment  review's  Phase  II  and  Phase  III  deliberations on 30 January 2003. Key among these, five major commands would lose their major command status and become direct reporting units

to Army staff principals. The U.S. Army Medical Command would report to the Surgeon General; the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command would report to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, G-2; the Military District of Washington would report to the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army; NETCOM would report to the Office of the Army Chief Information Officer/G-6; and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command would report to the Provost Marshal General, a new position on the headquarters staff. Although Army leaders  had  also  reached  preliminary  decisions  regarding  the realignment of other major command headquarters, they were awaiting feedback from the commands before announcing details. Only the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command were to remain unchanged. The Army expected to implement most of the initiatives in FY 2004.

On 9 April 2003, Army leaders announced plans to create a single command  to  perform  the  functions  of  both  the  active  Army's  Total Army Personnel Command and the Army Reserve Personnel Command. They intended to combine the two organizations into one field operating agency under the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, with the goal of providing integrated and interoperable personnel policies and procedures for active and reserve personnel. The Army National Guard would also integrate functions where feasible, and Army leaders expected the Civilian Personnel Operations Center Management Agency to merge into the organization at some future date. These reorganization plans resulted from a recommendation made by the Human Resources Integrated  Process  Team  that  Army  leaders  had  convened  in  2002  as part of the service's realignment review to examine ways the Army could streamline its management of uniformed and civilian personnel. Army leaders would officially establish the new agency, the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, on 2 October 2003.

In other reorganizations during FY 2003, U.S. Army South relocated from Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, to Fort Sam Houston, Texas. U.S. Army Forces Command continued to serve as the Army service component command of U.S. Joint Forces Command, but also became the Army component and Joint Force Land Component Command of  the  newly  formed  U.S.  Northern  Command.  The  Department of  Defense  activated  U.S.  Northern  Command  on  1  October  2002. Responsible  for  homeland  defense,  its  area  of  operations  included the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, parts of the Caribbean, and waters out to approximately 500 nautical miles from the shore of North America. The new combatant command achieved full operational capability on 1 October 2003.

## Management

In  October  2002,  Secretary  White  approved  a  plan  designed  to privatize  certain  Department  of  the  Army  jobs  by  enabling  private firms to compete for all 'noncore' Army positions, that is, positions not directly related to a unit's mission, such as accounting, maintenance, and  communications.  At  the  time,  more  than  154,000  civilians  and 58,000 military personnel performed these jobs. The Army commands were to formulate plans for opening all noncore positions to private competition and to provide a rationale for exempting selected functions, with the secretary to approve all of the plans by March 2003. As part of the review process, Army leaders also intended to identify jobs  that  could  be  converted  from  military  to  civilian  positions,  so that they could shift trained soldiers to duties requiring military skills. The Army called the initiative the 'Third Wave,' in reference to two previous outsourcing efforts in the 1980s and 1990s, and cited three reasons for it: to obtain noncore products and services from the private sector to permit Army leaders to focus on the service's core competencies,  or  those  functions  the  Army  performed  better  than  anyone else;  to  support  President  Bush's  management  agenda;  and  to  free up resources for the Global War on Terrorism. The initiative stalled, however, when Secretary White resigned in April, and the Army had launched no major outsourcing programs by the end of the fiscal year.

## Budget

In the budget request it submitted to Congress in February 2002, the Army requested $91 billion in total obligation authority for FY 2003, an amount that was nearly $10 billion more than Congress had appropriated to date for FY 2002. Army planners believed this sum would support the current authorized end strengths of the service's active and reserve components, while providing for a 4.1 percent pay raise for military personnel and allowing for targeted raises by grade and years of service. The budget also covered increased housing allowances  to  reduce  out-of-pocket  expenses  for  military  personnel  from 11.3 percent in FY 2002 to 7.5 percent in FY 2003, in accordance with Army plans to  eliminate  average  out-of-pocket  costs  completely  by FY 2005 for soldiers and families who resided off post. The budget supported readiness by funding training, critical training enablers, and ongoing operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Army leaders also planned to  purchase  vehicles  for  the  Army's  third  Stryker  brigade  combat team  and  to  invest  heavily  in  the  Comanche  helicopter,  the  (later canceled)  Crusader  self-propelled  howitzer,  and  unmanned  aerial

vehicles. They intended to apply 97 percent of all Army science and technology funding toward the design and development of the Army's transformed force of the future, known as the Objective Force, and enabling technologies, and believed that this level of funding would permit them to begin fielding the Objective Force before the end of the decade. President Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314) on 2 December 2002.

The FY 2004 budget request submitted by the Army to Congress in  February  2003  as  part  of  the  president's  budget  asked  for  $93.9 billion in total obligation authority, or $3 billion more than Congress had appropriated to date for FY 2003 ( Table 1 ). The 'central theme' of the budget, the Army explained, was 'meeting today's threats while preparing  for  tomorrow's  challenges.'  It  funded  a  'balanced  plan' that  supported  winning  the  war  on  terrorism,  maintaining  readiness, taking care of people, and transforming the Army. In addition to funding the Army's authorized end strength for active and reserve forces, the budget would finance an average pay raise of 4.1 percent for military personnel. Increases in housing allowances would further reduce out-of-pocket expenses for military personnel from 7.5 percent in FY 2003 to 3.5 percent in FY 2004. Key provisions of the budget supported continued training activities, financed operations in Bosnia and  Kosovo,  and  funded  vehicle  purchases  for  the  fourth  Stryker brigade combat team and further development of the Comanche helicopter.  The  budget  allocated  more  than  $1.8  billion  to  the  service's top  research, development,  and  acquisition  priority,  the  Future Combat Systems program. Committed to its transformation strategy, the Army reported that it planned to be selective in its modernization and recapitalization efforts for the current force, while still retaining efforts sufficient to satisfy essential readiness requirements. It intended to terminate twenty-four programs and restructure twenty-four others during the FY 2004 to FY 2009 timeframe and to reinvest the $22 billion  in  savings  in  higher-priority  programs  associated  with  Army transformation. In FY 2004, cancellations would yield $1.6 billion and restructuring efforts $600 million.

There was much that was not included in the FY 2004 president's budget.  Most  importantly,  the  Defense  Department's  budget  covered only  a  portion  of  the  homeland  defense  activities  performed  by  the Army as part of Operation noble eagle and included no funding for Operation endurIng Freedom in  Afghanistan or for potential operations in Iraq. Army leaders, moreover, believed that the shortfalls went beyond  this.  When  congressional  leaders  subsequently  asked  for  the services' annual assessment of unfunded requirements, General Shinseki suggested that the FY 2004 budget request left the Army underfunded

by some $6.2 billion, citing, especially, shortfalls in funding for readiness accounts such as base operations support activities, depot maintenance, and training ammunition procurement. In his 4 March letter to House Armed Services Committee leaders, General Shinseki also warned that the Army's FY 2004 budget problems would be made worse, with longterm repercussions, if Congress did not approve a supplemental spending bill  for  FY  2003  very  soon.  Shortly  after  combat  operations  in  Iraq began on 20 March, Army officials estimated that they would exhaust the service's FY 2003 operations and maintenance account by mid-May and expend all of the year's personnel funds by mid-June, even though a recent omnibus appropriations bill had provided the Army with almost $2 billion in additional funding for operations support and personnel.

On 16 April, President Bush signed a supplemental appropriations bill that guaranteed the Army an additional $24.6 billion for FY 2003 and put $15.7 billion in a new discretionary transfer account, the Iraq Freedom Fund, from which the Defense Department could allocate  additional  funding  to  the  services  and  others  for  specific purposes ( Table 2 ). On 17 September, the Defense Department also submitted  a  FY  2004  supplemental  budget  request  to  Congress that included $25 billion for the Army. When FY 2003 ended, the president had not yet signed the FY 2004 defense appropriations bill recently passed by Congress, and Congress was still considering the Defense Department's FY 2004 supplemental spending request.

## Personnel

## Army Strength

The active Army's strength in September 2003 totaled 493,563: 67,953 commissioned officers, 11,913 warrant officers, and 413,697 enlisted soldiers. This was an increase of 9,012 over its FY 2002 final strength.  Minorities  constituted  40.7  percent  of  the  active  Army, while women comprised 15.2 percent. Army personnel were stationed and deployed throughout the world, as shown in Table 3.

The  Army's  final  strength  was  well  over  its  budgeted  end strength of 480,000, exceeding even the 2 percent surplus permitted by  Congress.  This  was  due  in  part  to  stop-loss  policies  the  Army implemented to meet readiness needs during initial combat operations in Iraq. Stop-loss is a program that enables the service to retain soldiers who are deemed essential to national security on active duty beyond their scheduled date of retirement or separation. Nearly all of the soldiers retained under the stop-loss program in FY 2003 were expected to leave the Army during the first quarter of FY 2004.

The Army National Guard's strength in September 2003 totaled 351,089: 29,572 commissioned officers, 7,271 warrant officers, and 314,246 enlisted soldiers. This was an increase of just 11 over its FY  2002  final  strength.  However,  the  number  of  commissioned officers increased by 549, while the number of warrant officers and enlisted  soldiers  decreased  by  155  and  383,  respectively.  Minorities made up 26.5 percent of the Army National Guard. Women constituted 12.6 percent.

The Army Reserve's strength in September 2003 totaled 211,890: 37,615 commissioned officers, 2,682 warrant officers, and 171,593 enlisted soldiers. This represented an increase of 5,208 over its FY 2002 final strength. Minorities constituted 41 percent of the Army Reserve. Women comprised 24.3 percent.

## Enlisted Personnel

In FY 2003, the active Army met its recruiting goal, while the Army Reserve exceeded its objective by 2 percent. The Army National

Guard,  however,  achieved  only  87  percent  of  its  goal,  missing  its target by more than 7,500 recruits, as shown in Table 4.

The active Army surpassed its intelligence and aptitude objectives for new recruits. The Department of Defense has two principal qualitative goals for recruits to the nation's armed forces: at least 90 percent of all recruits who have no prior service should be high school graduates and at least 60 percent should score in Categories I to IIIA-that is,  at  or  above  the  50th  percentile-on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). In FY 2003, 92 percent of the Army's recruits were

high school graduates, 73 percent scored in Categories I to IIIA on the AFQT, and less than 0.4 percent scored in Category IV on the test, the lowest category still allowed to enlist.

In  addition  to  successfully  recruiting  new  soldiers,  the  active Army exceeded its enlisted retention targets, as shown in Table 5. Although the Army's FY 2003 budget contained significantly less funding for reenlistment bonuses than its FY 2002 budget, bonuses still helped the service to achieve specific retention goals. The Army continued its Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) and Targeted SRB programs, which were aimed at retaining soldiers in critical occupations or with special skills who might be tempted to move to the civilian workforce. The Bonus Extension and Retraining Program offered eligible soldiers the chance to extend their enlistments for retraining  in  shorthanded  military  occupational  specialties  and then to reenlist in their new specialties. The Army also addressed needs generated by current operations. In the fall of 2002, it began offering Critical Skills Retention Bonuses to certain Special Forces noncommissioned officers who were eligible for retirement but had fewer  than  twenty-five  years  of  service.  Additionally,  the  Army introduced a new temporary SRB in mid-September 2003 when it faced a potential reenlistment shortfall of some 6,000 soldiers late in the fiscal year. The $5,000 lump-sum, tax-free bonus was available to active-duty initial-term and mid-career soldiers who reenlisted while stationed in Korea or deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, or Kuwait. To receive the bonus, soldiers in Korea had to extend their overseas assignment an additional six months. Those in Southwest Asia had to complete their deployment with their current unit. All had to reenlist for a minimum of three years. Altogether, the Army spent  $102.6  million  on  selective  reenlistment  bonuses,  including Critical  Skills  Retention  Bonuses,  in  FY  2003,  compared  with $127.8 million in FY 2002.

The Army's success in recruiting and retaining soldiers in recent years also prompted a change in the service's reenlistment policy in FY 2003. At the beginning of the year, the Army reinstated a policy requiring  soldiers  to  reenlist  twelve  to  three  months  prior  to  their separation  date.  Starting  in  October  2000,  the  service  had  relaxed the  requirement  and  permitted  soldiers  to  reenlist  up  to  the  day of  separation.  During  the  intervening  two  years,  however,  some  8 percent of all soldiers, including a large number of career soldiers, had waited until the final three months to reenlist. Personnel officials believed this was too many soldiers who waited until the last minute. Earlier notification facilitated the programming of replacements for departing soldiers.

## Officer Personnel

During the fiscal year, the Army twice changed its time-in-service requirement for promotion to captain. In recent years, the Army had experienced  a  shortage  of  captains  because  it  had  not  accessioned enough lieutenants in the early 1990s and later lost a portion of them to a thriving economy. The FY 2002 Defense Authorization Act therefore had allowed the Army to lower the existing promotion requirement of forty-two months. In October 2002, the service began promoting officers to captain after just thirty-eight months of service. On 1 April 2003, however, Army officials initiated an incremental return to fortytwo months by raising the time-in-service requirement to forty months. The Army had surpassed its goal for the number of captains on active duty and preferred the longer time frame to prepare junior officers for their additional responsibilities. Army officials attributed the proliferation of captains partly to the stop-loss program, but primarily to the accelerated promotion of first lieutenants, an increase in the number of captains returning to active duty, and higher retention rates. Since October, some 700 more captains had decided to remain in the Army than had done so in past years.

In  January  2003,  General  Shinseki  approved  three  major  initiatives to revamp the service's Officer Education System. The initiatives resulted from recommendations contained in a 2001 report prepared by an Army Training and Leader Development Panel, which General Shinseki had directed the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) to convene in 2000 to review, assess, and provide recommendations regarding the development and training of Army leaders. The overhaul of officer  education  was  intended  to  better  equip  the Army's leaders for a post-Cold War operating environment and was aimed at two formative periods in an officer's career: initial entry, when

an officer  learned  to  lead  small  units,  and  selection  to  major,  when training prepared an officer for field-grade responsibilities.

First,  the  Army  planned  to  convert  its  existing  Officer  Basic Courses to a three-phase Basic Officer Leader Course (BOLC) that would offer lieutenants rigorous, standardized, small-unit leadership training. A future officer would receive precommissioning training, or BOLC I, at the United States Military Academy, at Officer Candidate School,  or  in  the  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps.  BOLC  II  would provide new lieutenants with initial-entry field leadership experience, while BOLC III would be the branch technical and tactical training phase (the former basic branch course) and be taught at branch service schools. Army leaders expected the Basic Officer Leader Course to be fully implemented in the third quarter of FY 2006.

Second,  Army  leaders  intended  to  replace  the  current  Officer Advanced or Career Courses and the Combined Arms and Services Staff School (CAS3) Staff Officers Course with a sequence involving a Combined Arms Staff Course for staff officers and a Combined Arms Battle Command Course for company, battery, and troop commanders. The new courses were to provide assignment-oriented training for staff officers and for company commanders and would be required at points in a captain's career when they would supply directly relevant training immediately before a captain assumed a duty position. Army leaders anticipated  that  the  new  courses  for  captains  would  be  fully  implemented by the second quarter of FY 2006.

Third,  the  Army  planned  to  introduce  what  it  called  Intermediate  Level  Education  (ILE),  which  would  provide  all  majors  the same  common core  of  operational  instruction,  as  well  as  tailored educational opportunities linked to the requirements of their specific career  field,  branch,  or  functional  area.  Army  policies  in  2003 permitted  just  50  percent  of  all  majors  to  attend  resident  instruction at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, while the remainder completed this education through nonresident courses that were considered inferior. Education  therefore  impacted  an  officer's  future  career  prospects.  Under the new ILE concept, 100 percent of the Army's majors would receive tailored resident instruction either at Fort Leavenworth or at various 'satellite' campuses.

The three-month common-core curriculum would be offered in residence at Fort Leavenworth for active and reserve component officers in the operations career field, selected officers from other armed services, and international officers. Information operations, operations support, installation  support,  and  special  branch  officers  would  receive  their common-core  training  from  qualified  Command  and  General  Staff

College  instructors  at  separate-but-equal  distance-education  campus sites. Reserve component officers would be able to obtain their instruction through The Army School System (TASS) classrooms or by means of an advanced distributed learning course. Officers in the operations career  field  would  attend  a  follow-on  seven-month  Advanced  Operations and Warfighting Course at Fort Leavenworth, which would center on planning and executing full-spectrum operations at the tactical and operational levels.  Other officers  would participate in functional area qualification courses. Some might also attend civilian schools as part of their education.

In August 2002, the Army had begun a pilot course of the ILE core curriculum at Fort Leavenworth for 256 officers in the operations career field, with a follow-on Advanced Operations and Warfighting Course.  In  the  spring  of  2003,  the  service  launched  a  pilot  of  the distance-education campus site concept at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and Fort Lee, Virginia. Army leaders planned to offer pilot courses until the ILE was fully implemented in FY 2005.

## Civilian Personnel

In FY 2003, the Army's civilian personnel strength was approximately 222,500. Army civilians worked in fifty-four countries. Nearly 2,000 deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation endurIng Freedom ,  Operation IraqI Freedom ,  and  the  Global  War  on  Terrorism.

In February 2003, the Army Training and Leader Development Panel issued a report on Army civilians. Previous reports had addressed officers, noncommissioned officers, and warrant officers. For its civilian personnel assessment, the panel had gathered information from more than 40,000 Army civilians, soldiers, and senior leaders using written and online surveys, focus groups, and personal interviews. The scope of effort produced the most thorough study of civilian training and leader development the Army had ever conducted. Overall, the panel concluded that there was 'no well-developed and executed, integrated, systemic  approach  for  civilian  leader  development  for  the  Army.' Current policies fell short of Army plans and did not meet the expectations of civilian employees. The panel also predicted that the future operating environment for Army civilians would require them to be more adaptable and self-aware.

In its report, the panel presented forty specific recommendations that  supported  twelve  general  recommendations  grouped  into  four categories: accountability, lifelong learning, interpersonal skills, and Army culture. In particular, the panel emphasized five basic recommendations. It urged the Army to (1) make civilian training, education,

and leader development a priority; (2) integrate civilian and military individual training, education, and development, where appropriate; (3) improve the relationship between officers, noncommissioned officers, warrant officers, and civilians; (4) create a training and development paradigm that incorporated lifelong learning; and (5) make the development  of  interpersonal  skills  a  priority.  An  Implementation Process  Action  Team  subsequently  narrowed  the  recommendations down to twenty-seven and identified three lead agents-the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, G-3, and TRADOC-to manage them.

## Wartime Personnel Actions

During  the  first  half  of  FY  2003,  Army  leaders  prepared  for possible military operations in Iraq by issuing a series of personnel directives designed to sustain unit readiness. On 22 January 2003, the Army announced a stop-movement order that suspended permanent change of station moves and temporary duty assignments, including training assignments, for most enlisted soldiers, warrant officers, and commissioned  officers  serving  in  selected  active  component  units. Those scheduled for a move or for temporary duty within sixty days of the order's effective date of 31 December 2002 were permitted to continue to their new assignments. Units affected included all of those either on alert for deployment or already deployed overseas that the Department of Defense expected to use in potential operations in the Persian Gulf region. Although Army leaders publicly announced the order, the specific units involved remained classified. The stop-movement order eventually affected more than 100,000 troops.

In  late  January,  the  Army  also  issued  a  stop-movement  order affecting troops assigned to U.S. Army Europe. The order applied to some 7,000 soldiers scheduled to transfer to new duty stations or to attend school between 1 March and 30 September 2003, as well as to about 300 officers scheduled to transfer between 1 March and 31 May 2003. The Army wanted to ensure that its units in Europe were as close to full strength as possible in case they were needed to support operations in Southwest Asia or elsewhere.

Although troops stationed in South Korea were not deployable, preparations elsewhere for a possible war with Iraq had repercussions there. Stop-movement orders affecting other Army units limited the number of soldiers available to rotate into units in South Korea. In February,  Army  officials  therefore  involuntarily  extended  by  ninety days the tours of nearly 3,000 soldiers, or more than a tenth of the approximately 27,000 Army troops stationed on the peninsula, who were scheduled to depart between 1 and 31 May. In early May, the Army announced ninety-day involuntary extensions on the tours of an additional 1,800 officers and enlisted soldiers who were scheduled to leave South Korea between 1 June and 30 August 2003.

Early  in  2003,  the  Army  also  instituted  a  new  stop-loss  policy. Starting in December 2001, the Army's leadership had issued a series of open-ended stop-loss orders affecting active and reserve soldiers in fifty-seven military occupational specialties deemed critical to the war on terrorism. The Army had modified this program in September 2002 to limit how long soldiers could be involuntarily retained, permitting them to  separate  or  retire  after  completing  twelve  months  of  additional service dating from the end of their original obligation or, for those who had completed their original obligations, from the date they were placed under stop loss. Two months later, the Army also lifted the restrictions on warrant officers in two specialties and on enlisted soldiers in six specialties. But on 14 February 2003, the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs, Reginald J. Brown, approved a much broader stop-loss directive applicable to all active component units deployed to or alerted for deployment to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. The Army's deputy chief of

staff for personnel, G-1, Lt. Gen. John M. LeMoyne, defended the policy by explaining that it 'supports the stability and strengthens unit cohesiveness  and  teamwork'  of  deploying  active  component  forces and would 'bolster the trust and confidence of our soldiers as they prepare to deploy.' The policy had no termination date and was to remain in place until the combatant commander determined that operational conditions no longer required it. The Army specified that in cases where soldiers were already affected by a twelve-month stop-loss policy, the earlier measure would control when they might separate or retire from the Army. For security reasons, Army leaders did not name the  units  involved  or  identify  the  number  of  soldiers  affected  when they issued the order.

On  14  May  2003,  following  what  was  believed  at  the  time  to be  the  end  of  major  combat  operations  in  Iraq,  the  Army  began  a phased elimination of the stop-movement restrictions on soldiers in the Persian Gulf region. On 27 May, the service also lifted the stoploss order governing active component units in the Operation IraqI Freedom area  of  responsibility,  as  well  as  those  which  had  been alerted for deployment. At the same time, the Army began removing military  occupational  specialties  from  the  twelve-month  skill-based stop-loss program. By late July 2003, only two specialties remained in the program. Because federal law required that separating and retiring soldiers receive predeparture counseling at least ninety days prior to leaving and Army policy required soldiers to receive counseling and attend transition workshops and briefings under the Army Career and Alumni Program, the service did not immediately release the soldiers concerned.  Instead,  Army  personnel  officials  established  a  phased system that provided for the separation or retirement of all affected soldiers during the period from October through December 2003.

Operations  in  Iraq  nevertheless  continued  to  influence  Army personnel  policies.  On  23  July  2003,  Acting  Chief  of  Staff  of  the Army General Keane announced a unit rotation plan for Iraq and indicated  that  all  future  tours  of  duty  for  both  active  and  reserve units serving in Iraq would last one year, rather than the usual six months for overseas deployments. Army leaders assumed that they would  need  to  maintain  current  force  levels  in  Iraq  until  at  least March 2004 and had concluded that the service could not continue to meet its worldwide obligations unless it required longer tours. At the time, the Army had in excess of 368,000 troops deployed to 120 countries.  More  than  232,000  were  active  component  soldiers.  Of these, 133,000 were on the ground in Iraq and another 34,000 were in Kuwait. Twenty-four of the Army's thirty-three active component brigades, or 73 percent, were deployed overseas.

General Keane briefs reporters at the Pentagon on the Army's unit rotation plan.



Soon  after  General  Keane's  announcement,  military  leaders  at U.S. Central Command asked the Department of Defense to institute a rest and recuperation (R&amp;R) program for individuals serving oneyear tours that would allow them to return home for a period during their deployment. On 23 September, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness approved a leave program for all personnel serving in the Central Command area of responsibility in support of Operation IraqI  Freedom .  Two  days  later,  the  command  launched an Interim R&amp;R Program for all active and reserve service members and deployed civilians that gave them two weeks of chargeable leave between  their  third  and  eleventh  month  in  theater  and  let  them  fly free from Kuwait to Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, or Los Angeles, or to Frankfurt, Germany. Subsequent travel was to be at their own expense. On 29 September, the Office of the Secretary of Defense designated the Army as the executive agent for the R&amp;R program.

In addition to personnel management challenges, the Army's operations  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  generated  concerns  about  the  mental health  of  soldiers.  During  the  summer  of  2002,  a  series  of  murders and suicides at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, had left seven soldiers and Army spouses dead. In three cases, soldiers had killed their wives after returning from service in Afghanistan. Army investigators subsequently

determined that these homicides had resulted partly from the fact that the three had come home directly from a combat zone with little time for decompressing and had encountered preexisting marital problems. Army officials  also  pointed  to  the  stigma  attached  to  seeking  voluntary  mental  health  assistance  for  marital,  financial,  or  psychological problems. Soldiers feared their careers would be hurt. In response to these developments, the deputy chief of staff for operations, G-3, Lt. Gen. Richard A. Cody, formed a Tiger Team to examine the impact of stress caused by deployments, with the aim of mitigating adverse effects associated  with  extended  deployments.  The  team  advised  the  Army to  devote  greater  attention  to  successfully  reintegrating  soldiers  and deployed civilians into their home environments. In March 2003, the Army shifted responsibility for this effort to the deputy chief of staff for personnel, G-1, who conducted a conference with relevant staff agencies and Army command representatives at Fort Bragg in April 2003. The following month, the G-1 released a plan for a Deployment Cycle Support Program designed to decrease the potentially negative impact of lengthy deployments on soldiers and their families.

The  Army  began  implementing  the  plan  immediately.  Mandatory for all active component and Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers, the reintegration program included assessments of soldiers by their supervisors and by medical personnel, as well as workshops and counseling for  soldiers  and  family  members  on  issues  ranging  from suicide prevention and stress reduction to marital communication and medical benefits. Soldiers completed parts of the program in theater and the remainder after their return to their home stations or demobilization stations. In August 2003, the Army also introduced a twentyfour-hour,  seven-days-a-week,  toll-free  phone  number  called  Army One Source. Soldiers, deployed civilians, and their families could use the number to talk to trained counselors or to obtain information and educational materials.

The Army also initiated a ground-breaking mental health study after five soldiers deployed to Iraq committed suicide in early July 2003. This number of suicides was perceptibly higher than the two reported each of the preceding three months, which had been consistent with the Army's historical rates. Accordingly, in late July the Office of the Surgeon General, in cooperation with the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, established the Operation IraqI Freedom (OIF) Mental Health Advisory Team (MHAT) to evaluate OIF-related mental health issues and services and to provide recommendations to the OIF medical and line commands. The team's charter tasked it with assessing  and  making  recommendations  regarding  possible  organizational  and  resource  deficiencies  related  to  four  developments:  the

increased  incidence  of  suicide;  an  upsurge  in  the  number  of  behavioral health patients flowing from Iraq to the United States through the  Army's  Landstuhl  Regional  Medical  Center  in  Germany  after May 2003; stress-related issues in the Iraqi theater; and deploymentrelated behavioral health issues among 3d Infantry Division soldiers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, which was one of the Army's major deployment platforms. In particular, the team was to consider command and control issues, communications, resource support, and Army policies.

The MHAT began its work almost immediately. From late August to early October 2003, a team of twelve military and civilian psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and combat stress experts met with behavioral health and medical care providers, unit ministry staffs, and unit leaders in Iraq and Kuwait. They also held small group discussions with troops and surveyed 756 deployed soldiers. This was the first time the Army conducted a mental health assessment of this kind in a combat zone. The MHAT was expected to report its findings in FY 2004.

## Manning Initiatives

During FY 2003, long-standing weaknesses in the Army's personnel management system, combined with challenges posed by the operations

in Iraq and Afghanistan, led the service to make significant changes in how it manned units. For nearly a century, the Army had mainly used the individual replacement system, which moved soldiers in and out of units as individuals even when a unit was deployed overseas. The few exceptions in recent decades had included unit rotations in the Sinai, Somalia, Haiti, and the Balkans during stability and support operations; in Kuwait as part of the effort to deter Iraq; and in Afghanistan during Operation endurIng Freedom . Critics of the Army's individual replacement system argued that it impeded training, weakened unit cohesion, and undermined readiness because about a third of a unit's personnel changed each year. Even before the United States launched Operation IraqI  Freedom ,  therefore,  senior  Army  leaders  were  discussing  the possible benefits of transitioning to a unit manning system. Under such a system, soldiers would be brought together in units for a fixed duration and would arrive, train, and deploy together. Proponents contended that unit manning would not only reduce personnel turbulence within units  and  thereby  improve  readiness  and  combat  effectiveness,  but  it would also provide stability and predictability for commanders, soldiers, and their families. Secretary of the Army Thomas White, in particular, pushed  the  Army  to  change  its  approach,  citing  the  need  to  modify personnel management practices to remain in step with other transformation initiatives. Army transformation was intended to improve the service's ability to deploy rapidly, in part by utilizing new technologies and  equipment.  And  stable,  well-trained  teams  would  be  especially important for employing advanced technologies effectively. Additionally, under the existing system only a few special operations units were able to respond quickly to crises. All other units remained at a low level of readiness, and building up and training the remainder of the force was  expensive  and  time-consuming.  This  situation  conflicted  directly with the goals of transformation.

In  August  2002,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for Personnel, G-1, had organized an informal study committee to look at the problem of personnel turnover and turbulence in Army units. Based on its recommendations, the Army chartered a Unit Manning Task Force in October 2002 to assess the potential ramifications of a unit manning system and to consider how such a system might work. The  G-1  group  worked  in  close  cooperation  with  a  Rotation  Task Force recently set up within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, G-3, which was developing a new rotation policy and identifying related force structure changes needed to permit the Army to sustain the war on terrorism. The following spring, in May 2003, the Army announced that it had selected the 172d Infantry Brigade (Separate), Forts Wainwright and Richardson, Alaska, to be the first unit to change to a unit manning system. This transition began during the summer as part of the unit's already scheduled conversion from a light infantry brigade to a medium-weight Stryker brigade.

In August 2003, however, the Army decided to make changes on a wider scale more quickly. The Army's senior leaders recognized that the service would be deploying large numbers of troops overseas for the foreseeable future and, under the individual replacement system, thousands  would  face  back-to-back  deployments  as  a  result.  They also  believed  that  high  personnel  turbulence  and  low  morale  would impair readiness. Incoming Chief of Staff General Schoomaker was committed  to  keeping  units  together.  Accordingly,  soon  after  his arrival, Army leaders ordered that the unit manning system be applied immediately  to  units  deploying  to  Iraq  and  Afghanistan  and  introduced  to  all  of  the  Army's  thirty-three  brigade  combat  teams  over time. Depending on the type of unit, its mission, and other factors, the life cycle of each unit would range between two and four years.

Already in late FY 2003, the Army began using elements of the unit manning system to prepare some of the units scheduled to deploy in early calendar year 2004, including the 1st Cavalry Division, which was headed to Iraq for twelve months, and the 2d and 3d Brigades of the 25th Infantry Division, which were slated for six-month tours in Afghanistan. The new approach obviated the need to rely on stoploss  and  stop-movement policies to man the units for the length of their deployments in order to sustain readiness. The Army also began employing a form of unit manning to reconstitute brigades and divisions  returning  from  Southwest  Asia  and  continued  to  utilize  the system in building the third Stryker brigade combat team in Alaska.

General Schoomaker's commitment to unit manning also led him to make it one of his key focus areas-now included under a broader topical rubric he called 'force stabilization'-when he assumed his new duties. In September, as the end of FY 2003 approached, he stood up Task Force Stabilization to carry on and expand the work of the Unit Manning Task Force. The new organization would eventually formulate a plan for the Army designed to both keep unit members together over a set period of time and retain soldiers at their home bases longer. Army leaders believed these changes would increase unit readiness while also supporting the well-being of soldiers and their families.

## Special Topics

In  January  2003,  U.S.  Army  Personnel  Command  replaced  all soldier email addresses in its database with Army Knowledge Online (AKO) addresses as AKO became the official email for all soldiers.

Army personnel officials made the change to ensure that every officer and soldier was accessible to them. Previously, the Army's personnel database  contained  a  variety  of  personal  and  unit  addresses.  Some of these remained current, but others were not updated after soldiers moved away from an installation. Soldiers would now have one email address for their entire lives.

In August, the Army migrated the active Army from its existing personnel management computer system, Standard Installation/Division Personnel System-3 (SIDPERS-3), to a new Electronic Military Personnel Office (eMILPO) system. The Army intended the eMILPO system to provide near real-time, Army-wide visibility on personnel information  via  a  Web-based  application.  The  system,  which  was simpler to use than SIDPERS-3 and accessible twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, assisted administrators in ensuring the accuracy  and  currency  of  all  personnel  records  and  enabled  soldiers  to monitor most elements of their personnel file, including pay changes and assignment data. In addition, commanders and other authorized users could draw on eMILPO to obtain data of importance to their unit or mission. The Army system was meant to be an interim step toward  the  fielding  of  a  larger,  multiservice,  integrated  personnel and pay management system called the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System.

The American Correctional Association accredited the new U.S. Disciplinary  Barracks  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas,  in  May  2003. To be accredited, the facility had to meet or exceed several hundred standards  established  by  the  association  relating  to  tasks  such  as in-processing,  moving,  and  feeding  prisoners.  Having  opened  in September 2002, the new barracks in May housed 436 prisoners with an average sentence of about nineteen years. Forty-two prisoners were serving life sentences, nine were serving life sentences with no chance for parole, and six were on death row.

During  FY  2003,  the  Army  expanded  its  involvement  with professional motorsports to help raise awareness among racing fans of  opportunities  available  with  the  Army.  In  2000,  the  service  had launched  a  successful  partnership  with  Don  Schumacher  Racing, sponsoring National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) Top Fuel champion driver  Tony  Schumacher. In July 2003, three-time NHRA Pro Stock Bike world champion Angelle Savoie and her teammate Antron Brown signed on with the U.S. Army Racing NHRA team. The Army also  inaugurated  a  relationship  with  the  National  Association  for Stock Car Racing (NASCAR), announcing in November 2002 that it was partnering with MB2 Motorsports on the Winston Cup racing circuit to become the principal sponsor of the team's Pontiac, driven

by  NASCAR  veteran  Jerry  Nadeau.  Painted  black  and  gold  and bearing the new number '01,' in reference to the service's 'Army of One' slogan, the car made its Army debut at the 2003 Daytona 500. In January 2003, the Army became an official sponsor of NASCAR as well and committed to spend at least $16 million across several levels of the stock car circuit. The commitment was the largest sports sponsorship for any branch of the U.S. armed forces. In addition to advertising during race broadcasts and sponsoring an award for NASCAR's Weekly Racing Series, the Army set up mobile recruiting stations at racetracks that included interactive areas where fans could test their marksmanship, drive simulated tanks, and fly simulated helicopters.

## Force Development, Training, and Operations

## Transformation

In  1999,  General  Shinseki  had  articulated  a  vision  for  transforming the Army into a fundamentally different kind of land force: a lighter, more mobile, information-based force. His ideas for change built on the work of predecessors, who had investigated how a postCold War Army operating in the information age might look and operate,  and  carried  implications  for  virtually  every  aspect  of  the Army, including force design, doctrine, leader development, training, logistics, and materiel.

In particular, Shinseki envisioned a future force, what the Army termed  the  Objective  Force,  which  would  consist  of  smaller  and more easily deployable standardized units that could respond faster and more effectively to a larger number of missions than the Army's existing heavy and light units. Eventually, the service would be able to deploy a combat-ready brigade anywhere in the world in 96 hours, a division in 120 hours, and five divisions in 30 days. In place of tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and many other current weapons systems, the Objective Force would employ the Future Combat Systems, a 'system of  systems'  composed  of  manned  and  unmanned  ground  vehicles, unmanned air vehicles, sensors, and munitions all linked by a digital information network. The new system would substitute superior information for weight and mass: units would see and hit the enemy first, rather  than  relying  on  heavy  armor  to  withstand  a  hit.  In  the  near term, the Army would create an Interim Force that would use commercially  available  digital  command  and  communications  technologies and medium-weight armored vehicles. The Interim Force would test concepts for the Objective Force while also providing the Army with medium-weight brigades that could deploy more quickly than existing heavy brigades but that would be more lethal and have greater tactical mobility  than  current  light  brigades.  While  the  service  tackled  the challenge of designing the Objective Force, developing Future Combat Systems, and fielding the Interim Force, it would invest sufficiently in

its existing force, the Legacy Force, to enable it to maintain readiness for current missions.

## Stryker Brigade Combat Teams

Progress continued in FY 2003 on the development of the initial Interim  Force  brigades,  known  since  July  2002  as  Stryker  brigade combat teams,  after  their  newly  christened  medium-weight  wheeled vehicles.  During  FY  2002,  the  Army  had  begun  equipping  the  first unit, the 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, at Fort Lewis, Washington, with Strykers and had launched an effort to certify it. In early 2003, officially approved doctrine for the brigade emerged with the completion of new field manuals. More than fifty different manuals were in circulation by the start of the year, either in final draft or completed form,  and  TRADOC  published  manuals  on  company  operations in  January 2003, on brigade operations in March, and on battalion operations in April. All had to be validated in the field. In early April, a brigade exercise at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, simulated mid-to-high-intensity combat. The exercise offered the first opportunity for the entire unit to conduct operations with all of its Strykers, though some of the vehicles were still lacking critical items. From March through May, the brigade conducted a deployment exercise designed to evaluate its ability to execute strategic and tactical deployments by air, land, and sea. A key part of the exercise involved transporting the unit's personnel and vehicles from Fort Irwin to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. In late May, a certification exercise at Fort Polk tested the brigade's soldiers in a mid-to-low intensity combat scenario that included both small-scale contingency operations and a stability and support operation. After the unit successfully completed the three exercises, U.S. Army Forces Command certified that it was ready to deploy, and, in late July, Acting Chief of Staff General Keane announced that the first Stryker brigade combat team would be among the units that would soon replace units returning from Iraq. The brigade was scheduled to deploy in FY 2004.

Despite this record of success, as the brigade prepared to deploy the Army was forced to devise a solution for a vehicle problem that had materialized: the Stryker was vulnerable to rocket-propelled grenade antitank systems, which by the summer of 2003 Iraqi insurgents were using frequently against U.S. troops. To help the vehicles withstand attacks, the Army decided to add slat armor-an encircling grid of hardened steel bars-to the hulls of the Strykers, in order to make incoming rockets detonate before they hit anything vital. The extra protection, which was added after the vehicles arrived in theater, added

weight and girth that affected the vehicle's maneuverability in urban areas, but the Army had no immediate alternatives.

During  the  fiscal  year,  the  service  was  also  converting  the  1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, at Fort Lewis to a Stryker brigade combat team. It began the conversion of the 172d Infantry Brigade (Separate) at Forts Wainwright and Richardson in the summer.

## The Objective Force and Future Combat Systems

In December 2002, the Army released The Objective Force in 2015 White  Paper ,  which  captured  the  Army's  vision  of  what  the  Objective Force would look like and how it would operate in 2015. Several months earlier, the Army's senior leadership had met for an update and assessment of efforts toward fielding initial Objective Force capabilities within the decade and an opportunity to approve proposed concepts and offer guidance. Dissatisfied when he learned that the planning for the  Objective  Force  was  focused  primarily  on  the  next  ten  to  twelve months, General Shinseki had asked the Army's Objective Force Task Force to look farther ahead. To help refine its definition of the Objective Force and the path for achieving this goal, he suggested the task force  pick  a  date  in  the  future,  figuratively  'stand  on  the  mountain,' look around and back, then plot a course to reach that point. The white

paper describing the character of the Objective Force in 2015 was one result of this suggestion and was to serve as a target for Army planners. It  addressed  eighteen  functional  areas,  including  training  and  leader development,  human  resources,  battle  command,  information  operations, sustainment, equipping, and installations. Following the paper's release, the Army developed more detailed plans for each area which contained  milestones,  'inchstones,'  and  timelines.  Lt.  Gen.  John  M. Riggs, director of the task force, expected the white paper to be a 'living document' that the Army would update when the national and strategic focus of the United States shifted or available resources changed.

Developing  and  fielding  the  Objective  Force  was  nevertheless the  Army's  modernization  investment  priority.  In  February  2003, the  service  completed  a  Future  Years  Defense  Plan  for  FYs  2004 through  2009  in  which  it  proposed  to  invest  nearly  98  percent  of its total science and technology (S&amp;T) funding in programs needed to develop Objective Force technologies. In addition, 70 percent of its  planned research, development, and acquisition funding was to support the development and fielding of the Objective Force. Central to this investment strategy were S&amp;T efforts to explore, identify, and develop  the  technologies  required  to  bring  to  fruition  the  Future Combat  Systems  (FCS),  which  would  equip  the  Objective  Force and help determine its capabilities and doctrine. FCS represented 29 percent of all of the Army's S&amp;T investments.

The FCS program achieved several interim goals during the fiscal year. Both the Army Requirements Oversight Council and the Joint Requirements  Oversight  Council  approved  the  FCS  Operational Requirements Document, which explained in detail the system the Army proposed to develop based on the results of work completed during  the  concept  and  technology  development  phase  of  the program. The FCS Operational Requirements Document described a  set  of  eight  manned  systems  and  ten  unmanned  vehicle,  sensor, and  munition  systems,  as  well  as  the  requirements  for  the  battle command network that would link them. The FCS program referred to  its  proposed  configuration  as  the  18+1+1  design,  to  emphasize the importance of both the network and the soldier to the successful functioning of FCS. Due to funding concerns and questions about technological  maturity,  General  Shinseki  in  the  spring  of  2003 directed the Army to defer fielding four of the systems so that the service  might  still  meet  its  target  of  attaining  initial  operational capability for the first FCS-equipped unit during 2010. The service also  modified  the  program  schedule.  Initial  operational  capability was redefined as fielding just one FCS-equipped maneuver battalion, alongside two legacy battalions, in the first brigade-sized FCS unit.

Full  operational  capability  would  not  be  achieved  until  late  2012, with the fielding of two additional FCS-equipped battalions.

During the spring of 2003, the FCS program also underwent a Milestone  B  decision.  At  Milestone  B,  major  acquisition  programs are evaluated to determine whether an S&amp;T program has progressed sufficiently to permit advanced development of the weapons system and, if the decision is positive, the program becomes an acquisition program. Given the complexity and cost of the FCS effort, Defense Secretary  Rumsfeld  in  March  requested  that  an  independent  panel assess the Army's program prior to the Milestone B decision, which was scheduled for May. Retired Air Force General Larry D. Welch of the Institute for Defense Analyses chaired a panel composed of retired Defense  Department  executives  and  senior  retired  officers  from  all of the services, supported by researchers from the institute and highranking advisers from the Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Its task was to review the projected capabilities of the Objective Force and its FCS components, the existing assessments of critical technologies, and the FCS acquisition management plan to evaluate the program's readiness for Milestone B approval.

In April, the panel issued a generally favorable report, even as it acknowledged that  producing  the  FCS  family  of  systems  would  be complex and challenging. The Army was on a 'logical track' to develop into a more agile and lethal force, the panel concluded, and it validated the service's FCS concept. It noted that development of FCS would require extensive support from Army and defense agencies outside of the actual program, that several key technologies were not mature, and that  the  program was not meeting weight goals necessary to enable swift  deployment. Nevertheless, it maintained that the program was on a sound institutional basis and possessed plans to mitigate risk in critical technologies. The panel asserted that providing network service within  FCS-equipped formations, between FCS formations and the rest of the force, and with joint and combined forces stood out as the most critical challenge to the FCS concept, and that software development presented the greatest cost and schedule risk to the program. The panel nonetheless judged the program as feasible.

During a 14 May 2003 meeting of the Defense Acquisition Board, the Army received a favorable Milestone B decision from Under Secretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics  Edward 'Pete' C. Aldridge Jr., permitting the program to proceed to system development  and  demonstration.  The  Milestone  B  decision  also marked the  transition  of  FCS  from  a  joint  science  and  technology program between the Army and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to a purely Army acquisition program.

To assist in the transition to system development, Acting Secretary of the Army Brownlee on 1 July 2003 commissioned General Welch to form a second panel, which he tasked with examining the organizations  and  processes  that  would  affect  the  service's  ability to achieve at least minimal Objective Force capabilities by the close of the decade and advising Army leaders on the most effective and efficient means to attain their objectives. To this end, he asked the panel to review the service's business practices, its acquisition and requirements generation processes, and the roles, missions, and functions of pertinent Army organizations. The resulting recommendations focused mainly on the management of the FCS program. Key among these, the panel proposed that the commanding general of TRADOC be named the single designated authority for force design and doctrinal development in support of FCS, the Objective Force, and joint force integration and that he be assisted by a new 'Futures Center' at TRADOC headed by a three-star officer. This structure would work together with the FCS and Objective Force elements of the Army's acquisition community. The panel similarly recommended that the Army establish a deputy assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology for FCS acquisition, a threestar position reporting directly to the Army acquisition executive, to oversee the FCS program and ensure integration and synchronization with complementary Army programs.

In July, the Defense Acquisition Board approved the transition of the Warrior Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program to the system development and demonstration phase as well. Separate from the FCS program, but one of several vital complementary programs, WIN-T was to be the integrating communications network connecting various levels of command within the Objective Force.

In August, incoming Army Chief of Staff General Schoomaker redesignated the Objective Force as the 'Future Force.' The new term signaled a change in emphasis, from fielding an ideal Objective Force unit some ten years in the future and attempting to modify the Army's entire force structure, to fielding useful capabilities to the current force as soon as they became available, with less focus on the character of the end state of the force.

## Modularity

In making plans for his tenure as chief of staff during the summer of  2003,  General  Schoomaker  was  attuned  to  both  the  changed national security requirements in a post-September 11 world and the challenges the Army now confronted. For much of its recent history, the

Army had been a force forward deployed in Germany and Korea and designed to fight a large-scale conventional war. Now it had troops on the ground not only in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also in the Balkans and the Sinai, and was participating in counterterrorism operations around the world. Adapting the Army to these conditions was General Schoomaker's priority. In doing so, he drew in part on radically new force  design  concepts  Army  planners  had  been  developing  for  the service's Objective Force. Fundamental to these was the idea of modularity, that is, the creation of standardized, expandable Army elements capable of being tailored to accomplish virtually any assignment. The new units would be as capable as the existing brigades, divisions, corps, and armies the Army's planners envisioned they would replace. But the units would also be adaptable enough to assume whatever form was necessary to meet a broad range of missions.

At General Schoomaker's direction, in September 2003 the Army began  converting  itself  from  an  organization  centered  on  divisions numbering from 10,000 to 18,000 soldiers to a modular force based on brigades totaling at most 3,900. The chief of staff believed the conversion would enable the Army to better support current operations and help it to respond more quickly to the needs of combatant commanders when  future  contingencies  arose.  In  recent  years,  the  brigade,  rather than the division, had become the main tactical echelon in the Army's planning for overseas deployments. Senior commanders in Iraq, moreover,  had  been  responding  to  various  tactical  problems  by  tailoring units into temporary and permanent groupings. This meant that even when a division deployed to Iraq, it might soon relinquish operational control of some of its brigade combat teams while assuming control of other nondivisional elements. Smaller units, meanwhile, were sometimes rendered incapable of performing their full missions due to insufficient manpower or expertise. Schoomaker also saw the conversion as a chance to  increase  the  number  of  brigade  combat  teams.  The  current  force, comprising  thirty-three  division-based  brigade  combat  teams  in  the active Army and thirty-six in the National Guard, was not large enough to permit adequate intervals between deployments. Schoomaker wanted new unit designs that would allow the fielding of between seventy-seven and eight-two brigade combat teams with a temporary increase in the active Army's strength of only 30,000. Finally, he knew that the Army could  expect  solid  support  for  the  change  from  Secretary  Rumsfeld, who was an outspoken advocate of transforming the Army into a more readily deployable, digitized organization.

General Schoomaker took a two-pronged approach to designing the  new  modular  brigades.  First,  he  asked  Maj.  Gen.  William  G. Webster  Jr.,  the  incoming  commander  of  the  3d  Infantry  Division

(Mechanized), to prepare the division  for  its  second  deployment  to Iraq by developing a plan to convert its three brigades into five heavy units using only the soldiers and materiel it already possessed. Second, he directed TRADOC to organize both the 3d Infantry Division and the  101st  Airborne  Division  (Air  Assault)  into  prototype  modular organizations, but to avoid augmenting the two divisions in any way. Instead, it was to utilize their existing soldiers and materiel. TRADOC subsequently  organized  Task  Force  Modularity  under  Maj.  Gen. Robert W. Mixon at Fort Monroe, Virginia, to tackle this assignment.

The chief of staff expected the Army to move quickly. He set a January  2004  deadline  for  delivery  of  the  new  heavy  and  infantry brigade combat team organizations, with designs for support brigades and higher echelons to be completed later in 2004. The Army was also to reorganize both divisions before the end of 2004 and their scheduled  deployment  to  Iraq  in  2005.  Schoomaker  recognized  that  the new units would not be perfect and believed the Army could make changes as necessary over time. However, he established three goals the initial brigade combat teams had to meet. They had to be as capable as current units. They had to be easier to deploy than current units. And they had to be configured in a way that permitted the service to duplicate them without having to seek an increase in manpower.

## Training

The  Army  issued  two  new  training  manuals  in  FY  2003.  After twenty-one  months  of  development  and  input  from  officers  and noncommissioned  officers  at  all  levels,  the  Army  published  Field Manual  (FM)  7-0, Training  the  Force ,  in  October  2002.  The  new manual  replaced  FM  25-100,  which  had  the  same  name.  As  the service's capstone, overarching training doctrine, FM 7-0 outlined the Army's training management cycle and offered guidance on how to plan, execute, and assess training and leader development. It covered training in three separate, but related, domains-operational, institutional,  and self-development-and was applicable to all units, at all levels, in all components of the Army. The manual integrated lessons learned from recent military operations and differed from its predecessor in combining training and leader development in one program; establishing joint, multinational, and interagency training as a priority; and synchronizing training doctrine with the full spectrum of Army operations, including offensive, defensive, and stability operations.

Where FM 7-0 focused on training management, the complementary FM 7-1, Battle Focused Training , centered on the specifics of training. Published  in  September  2003,  FM  7-1  replaced  FM  25-101  bearing

the same name. As the service's doctrinal foundation for how to train, it defined the Army training system, outlined who was responsible for training and training support, and described how to conduct training. The manual's stated goal was 'to create leaders who know how to think and apply enduring training principles to their units and organizations.' Army leaders believed that the two manuals, taken together, provided a 'top-to-bottom understanding of training' that was critical for linking the three training domains and for the successful execution of training.

## Deployed Operational Forces

At  the  beginning  of  FY  2002,  the  United  States  had  launched Operation endurIng Freedom in Afghanistan in response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center  towers.  Although  American  forces  and  their  Afghan  allies quickly toppled the Taliban government that had provided a safe haven for the al-Qaeda terrorist group behind the attacks, at the start of FY 2003  U.S.  troops  were  still  locating  and  destroying  elusive  residual Taliban  and  al-Qaeda  forces,  coordinating  humanitarian  initiatives, strengthening  the  new  Afghan  government,  and  performing  other necessary  tasks.  Responsibility  for  reconstruction,  political-military issues, and assistance to the government lay with Combined Joint Task Force-180 (CJTF-180) led by the commander of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps, Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill, and comprised of personnel from his headquarters, augmented by staff from the other services and the coalition partners of the United States. Combined Task Force-82 (CTF-82), made up mostly of elements of the 82d Airborne Division and  commanded  by  the  division's  commander,  Maj.  Gen.  John  R. Vines, served as the tactical headquarters for combat operations.

In September 2002, General Vines had decided to change how CTF-82  deployed  its  units.  Where  previously  the  task  force  had maintained most of its forces at the Bagram and Kandahar airfields, it  now began constructing forward operating bases in a number of locations  in  the  southern  and  southeastern  provinces  of  Afghanistan  and  closer  to  the  porous  border  with  Pakistan.  This  change carried the risk of Afghan resentment, as coalition forces were much nearer to the population, but it also enabled the coalition to operate more effectively in areas where the enemy had sought refuge. From these bases, American soldiers carried out security patrols, sent civil affairs  and  psychological  operations  teams  into  cities  and  towns, and responded to recurring harassment from enemy small arms and indirect  fire.  They  supplemented  these  activities  with  a  succession of  larger  operations  designed  to  locate  hostile  forces  and  uncover

The goals of the United States and its coalition partners required noncombat-oriented operations as well. Mostly notably, U.S. troops were engaged in reconstruction operations and an effort to build an Afghan army, both of which also supported the larger aim of legitimizing the new central government and increasing its influence in the provinces. Significant in the sphere of reconstruction was the establishment  of  provincial  reconstruction  teams  (PRTs).  In  early  2002, the  Army  had  set  up  small  Coalition  Humanitarian  Liaison  Cells in  different  parts  of  Afghanistan.  Encompassing  just  a  handful  of civil affairs soldiers, their mission was to assess humanitarian needs,

implement small-scale reconstruction projects, and establish relations with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and nongovernmental organizations in the area. In early FY 2003, CJTF-180 sought to expand and improve this civil affairs effort by developing PRTs, which were to be staffed by both civilian and military personnel, as  well  as  by  representatives  of  the  Afghan  government,  and  have enhanced  force  protection.  Their  major  goals  would  include  facilitating reconstruction, improving security, and extending the authority of the Afghan central government. The first PRT opened in Gardez in January 2003. Collocated with U.S. Special Forces 'A' team members, the PRT also had soldiers from the 82d Airborne Division supplying security. A civil affairs team provided daily contact with local Afghans and tribal leaders. When the PRT became fully operational, the only U.S. agency with a civilian representative on site was the Department of State, but representatives from the Agency for International Development  and  the  Department  of  Agriculture  later  joined  the  team. Similar  PRTs  began  operations  in  Bamian  and  Kunduz  during  the spring, and in July, a PRT opened in Mazar-e Sharif with the United Kingdom serving as the lead country. New Zealand took over the lead in Bamian in September.

During the fall of 2002, responsibility for overseeing the training of  the  fledgling  Afghan  National  Army  belonged  to  the  Office  of Military  Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A), a small and underresourced cell in the U.S. Embassy, while a battalion from the Army's 3d Special Forces Group conducted the actual training mission. When Maj. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry became the new chief of OMC-A in October, it was facing substantial challenges. A coalition plan, which Afghan interim president Hamid Karzai endorsed in December 2002, called for expanding the Afghan army from its current size of less than 3,000 soldiers to nearly 70,000 men. Yet recruiting in Afghanistan was difficult and attrition rates for soldiers were high. Moreover, the coalition would need to build the army's infrastructure, organization, and leadership, as well as train troops. To handle this effort, General Eikenberry  soon  enlarged  his  staff,  turned  to  coalition  allies  for  training assistance,  and  in  May  2003  formed  Combined  Joint  Task  Force PhoenIx ,  composed of the headquarters of the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and its subordinate 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry, to help with training.

The  establishment  of  PRTs  and  the  expanded  Afghan  army training program were signs of a change in the way the coalition was approaching  its  campaign  in  Afghanistan.  Prior  to  the  summer  of 2003, CJTF-180 had viewed its campaign as still centered on decisive combat operations to rid the country of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. In keeping with General McNeill's original plans, however, by May the task force had transitioned to the next phase of its campaign, namely, humanitarian assistance and support to the new government. While visiting Afghanistan on 1 May 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld declared that major combat operations had ended and that U.S. forces had moved 'to a period of stability and stabilization and reconstruction activities.' Shortly afterward, General McNeill and most of his staff from the XVIII Airborne Corps left Afghanistan and, on 27 May, command of CJTF-180 passed to General Vines. Soldiers from CTF-82 had begun returning to the United States in April, and the 10th Mountain Division headquarters and other combat and support elements from the division started arriving in May. The 10th Mountain Division headquarters  became  the  staff  for  CJTF-180,  substantially  reducing  the size and capabilities of the senior military command in Afghanistan.

Throughout the fiscal year, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan remained relatively small, hovering near 10,000. This was due in part to the buildup of forces in the Persian Gulf region for Operation IraqI  Freedom .  During  the  first  half  of  FY  2003,  the  Army made ready for possible operations in Iraq, even as Bush administration officials attempted to use diplomatic means to neutralize the threat they saw in Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction they believed he was hiding. To increase pressure on Saddam and prepare for an invasion, the 3d Infantry Division began deploying to Kuwait in late 2002, followed in February and March 2003 by the 101st Airborne Division and the 82d Airborne Division's  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team  and  division  headquarters. The  4th  Infantry  Division  was  alerted  for  deployment  in  January as  well  and  loaded  its  equipment  on  ships  bound  for  Turkey.  But the Turkish government would not permit American troops to cross into Iraq from its territory, and the division remained stateside until receiving orders in March to deploy to Kuwait. As of 31 March 2003, more than 269,000 active duty and reserve soldiers were deployed in support of Operation IraqI Freedom.

After President Bush determined that diplomatic efforts had failed to achieve the administration's goals, he issued an ultimatum on 17 March telling Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq within forty-eight hours or face military repercussions. The dictator refused and combat operations began. The visible start of the war occurred on 20 March, although

Central Intelligence Agency operatives had been active in Iraq for some time and had helped to lay the groundwork for special operations forces that also had already entered the country . Coalition ground forces crossed from  Kuwait  into  southern  Iraq  on  the  night  of  20  March,  following missile and air strikes on key political and military targets. The ground campaign was led by Lt. Gen. David D. McKiernan, commanding general of the U.S. Third Army, which was serving as U.S. Central Command's Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC). The campaign involved  a  two-pronged  push  north  from  Kuwait  to  Baghdad.  The  I Marine  Expeditionary  Force,  supported  by  the  1st  (United  Kingdom) Armoured Division and a small contingent of Polish forces, was responsible for the eastern route, while the Army's V Corps led the main effort west of the Euphrates River under the leadership of Lt. Gen. William S. Wallace. Spearheading the western push was Maj. Gen. Buford C. Blount III's 3d Infantry Division, which moved quickly toward Baghdad, reaching Saddam International Airport on 4 April. The 101st Airborne Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. David H. Petraeus, and elements of the 82d Airborne Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr., followed on the heels of the 3d Infantry Division, clearing resistance in southern Iraqi cities and securing the corps' lines of communication to facilitate its rapid advance to the capital. By 9 April, organized resistance

to  coalition  forces  in  Baghdad  had  ended,  and  the  statue  of  Saddam Hussein in the city's Firdos Square was toppled, an action many observers interpreted as signifying the end of the dictator's rule.

In northern Iraq, some 1,000 soldiers from the 173d Airborne Brigade parachuted into the country on 26 March. They secured an airfield and were soon joined by additional troops. Subordinated to the Combined Joint  Special  Operations  Task  Force-North  (CJSOTF-North),  which included members of the Army's 10th Special Forces Group, they worked with the Special Forces soldiers and Iraqi Kurdish troops to expand the northern front of coalition operations. In western Iraq, Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West (CJSOTF-West), including soldiers from the Army's 5th Special Forces Group as well as British and Australian commandos, provided intelligence on Iraqi forces, secured military sites, and destroyed enemy elements they encountered. Throughout the campaign,  soldiers  also  supported  the  I  Marine  Expeditionary  Force, providing military policing,  engineer,  psychological  operations,  and  air medical evacuation capabilities, among others.

In accordance with the coalition's original war plans, U.S. forces continued  to  flow  into  Iraq  even  after  the  collapse  of  the  regime.

By the beginning of May, Army units were distributed throughout the  country.  The  101st  Airborne  Division  had  established  itself  in northwestern Iraq, while to its southeast the 173d Airborne Brigade assumed responsibility for the city of Kirkuk and its surroundings. The  4th  Infantry  Division  set  up  operations  in  the  area  between Kirkuk  and  Baghdad.  The  3d  Infantry  Division  and  3d  Armored Cavalry Regiment began operating in Al Anbar Province in western Iraq.  The  1st  Armored  Division,  eventually  augmented  by  the  2d Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 2d Brigade Combat Team of the 82d Airborne Division, moved into Baghdad. Hunting for high-value targets and conducting reconnaissance and psychological operations across these areas of responsibility were special operations soldiers from  the  new  Combined  Joint  Special  Operations  Task  ForceArabian Peninsula, created from the merger of CJSOTF-North and CJSOTF-West.

On 15 June 2003, the coalition redesigned its command and control architecture.  Combined Joint Task Force-7 replaced CFLCC as the coalition military headquarters in Iraq, allowing CFLCC to return to its role of supporting land operations throughout Central Command's area of operations, including in Afghanistan. The headquarters of V Corps, now led by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, became the core of the new task force, necessitating the transformation of the Army headquarters into a joint and combined organization responsible for the

theater-strategic and operational levels of war as well as for ground operations at the tactical level.

Although major combat operations ended relatively quickly in Iraq, the Army immediately confronted new challenges there. As the fighting subsided, U.S. military forces began assisting the civilian organizations created  by  the  Bush  administration  to  administer  Iraq,  first  working with  the  Organization  for  Reconstruction  and  Humanitarian  Assistance and, after early May, with its successor, the Coalition Provisional Authority. The primary responsibility of coalition forces was to provide security, but coalition leaders interpreted this mandate broadly, believing it  encompassed  tasks  such  as  helping  to  rebuild  Iraqi  infrastructure and establish local governing organizations. More traditional security actions undertaken by American soldiers included conducting cordon and search operations, killing or capturing adversaries, setting up checkpoints to control population movements, and training new Iraqi security forces. Over time, however, it became clear that the defeat of Saddam's military had not ended the threat to U.S. troops in Iraq, as can be seen in Table 7. Late in the fiscal year, American forces faced a growing number of attacks from opponents who used what the incoming commander of U.S. Central Command, General John P . Abizaid, described in July 2003 as 'guerrilla tactics.'

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Change

On 16 May 2003, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum, announced a major effort to transform the nation's disparate National Guard elements into a more cohesive, joint force. Reducing the number of headquarters throughout the United States from 162 to 54 was integral to this plan. At the time, the District of Columbia and each state and territory had three National Guard headquarters: a state office, an Air Force office, and an Army office. These would now be consolidated into one joint headquarters in each area. The changes, General Blum argued, would better prepare the National Guard to address current realities and future threats. They would make the National Guard more efficient and responsive and more accessible to its active-duty colleagues, who did not always understand how to interact with the National Guard. 'We will have a joint command that will look, smell and sound like what the active duty [military] is used to working with,' the state adjutant general of Kansas later explained. In addition, the changes would improve the ability of Guard troops to operate in a joint arena. 'We fight jointly,' said Blum. 'We need to train and operate on a daily basis in a joint environment so that we can make  that  transition  very  quickly.'  Transforming  existing  National Guard headquarters into joint headquarters would also increase the number of joint billets available to reserve component officers, which could improve their prospects for promotion.

At  a  conference  of  the  Adjutants  General  Association  of  the United States, National Guard leaders from fifty-four states and territories unanimously endorsed General Blum's plans. By the end of the fiscal year, the headquarters consolidation process was under way, with the state adjutants general setting up single joint force headquarters in each state that would begin operations in October 2003.

As part of the transformation effort, the National Guard Bureau itself also reorganized. Formerly comprised of a joint staff and separate Army and Air Force directorates, the bureau became a joint headquarters. The director of the Army National Guard, Lt. Gen. Roger

C. Schultz, and his counterpart in the Air National Guard, Lt. Gen. Daniel James III, became deputy chiefs of the National Guard Bureau.

The  U.S.  Army  Reserve  likewise  renamed  and  refocused  its regional support commands during the fiscal year. The primary type of  headquarters  unit  providing  command  and  control  to  reserve units throughout the continental United States, the regional support commands had over the years increasingly devoted time and resources to functions such as computer network operations, facilities management, real estate transfers, and the like. In FY 2003, as part of the Army headquarters realignment effort, the Army Reserve transferred these information  and  installation  management  functions  to  NETCOM and the Installation Management Agency, both of which the Army had activated on 1 October 2002. On 16 July 2003, the Army Reserve redesignated  the  regional  support  commands  as  regional  readiness commands and returned their focus to training, readiness, mobilization, and leader development.

The Army Reserve also worked to merge its operations with those of the active Army in two areas. First, it pursued efforts to combine the Army Reserve Personnel Command with the Total Army Personnel

Command  to  create  the  U.S.  Army  Human  Resources  Command, which the service activated on 2 October 2003. Second, on 25 June 2003, the chief of the Army Reserve and the Army's chief information officer signed a memorandum of agreement that dissolved the separate Office of the Army Reserve Chief Information Officer staff and merged it with the  Office  of  the  Army  Chief  Information  Officer/G-6  organization. The merger integrated Army and Army Reserve information management policies, procedures, and operations under the G-6.

## Personnel Management

In  September  2003,  the  Army  Reserve's  strength  exceeded  its congressionally authorized end strength of 205,000 by nearly 7,000. During the fiscal year, the Army Reserve surpassed its 40,900 goal for new accessions by almost 1,000.

The  Army  National  Guard  exceeded  its  congressionally  authorized  end  strength  of  350,000  by  more  than  1,000  in  September 2003. It initially established an accessions goal for the fiscal year of 64,112, but reduced this to 62,000 because of its continuing success managing  losses.  It  exceeded  its  retention  objectives  for  both  firstterm and career soldiers and had an overall attrition rate of just 16.7 percent during the year. Of a first-term eligible population of 21,003, the Army National Guard reenlisted 14,399, surpassing its target of 13,652. Of a career-eligible reenlistment population of 43,812, it reenlisted 38,433, exceeding its 37,243 goal. Despite lowering its accessions objective, however, the Army National Guard achieved only 87 percent of its goal. Operation IraqI Freedom and the Army's high operating tempo hindered recruitment. Potential recruits and their parents were concerned about the possibility of long deployments and war service. At  the  same  time,  Army  stop-loss  policies  reduced  the  number  of soldiers leaving the active Army and joining Army National Guard units. The Army National Guard programmed non-prior service and prior service accessions at a 53 percent to 47 percent mix and ended the year with 55 percent non-prior service recruits and 45 percent prior service recruits.

In November 2002, at the urging of reserve component leaders, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Reginald  Brown signed  a  stop-loss  policy  designed  to  improve  unit readiness in the reserve components. Army leaders recognized that the Army National Guard and Army Reserve were principally tasked with providing  mobilized  units  in  support  of  ongoing  Army  operations, rather  than  with  providing  individual  replacement  fillers  for  active units.  Furthermore,  when  reserve  units  needed  to  fill  empty  billets

and soldiers  were  not  available  from  the  Individual  Ready  Reserve, the service's mobilization pool of reservists not assigned to units, the units were forced to use individuals from nonmobilized units. These circumstances had gradually degraded reserve component unit readiness. Under the new policy, which also covered units that were already mobilized, the Army placed all reserve units in stop-loss status from the date they were alerted for mobilization until ninety days after demobilization. Exempted were soldiers approved for disability retirement, those being separated involuntarily, and those who faced mandatory retirement due to age or length of service.

In FY 2002, the Army had issued stop-loss orders affecting soldiers in  certain  military  occupational  specialties  in  both  the  active  and reserve components and set a limit on the additional time they would be required to serve, specifying that they could separate or retire twelve months from the end of their original obligation or from the date they were placed under stop loss. In issuing its new unit stop-loss policy in  November  2002,  the  Army  stated  that  this  skill-based  stop-loss program would remain in effect. Affected soldiers would be permitted to retire or separate voluntarily only upon completion of their twelvemonth period of stop loss or ninety days after the demobilization of their unit, whichever was later. In late May 2003, after major combat operations  in  Iraq  had  ended,  the  Army  began  removing  military occupational  specialties  from  the  skill-based  stop-loss  program  and just two were still included by late July. Accordingly, Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers who had been retained under this program and who were not subject to the unit stop-loss order were able to separate or retire. The unit stop-loss order remained in effect.

## Training and Readiness

The Army National Guard continued to manage its overall readiness by prioritizing its limited resources, with Force Support Package units normally receiving the highest priority because of the types of units they were and their need to deploy quickly. Many were mobilized to support Operations noble eagle, endurIng Freedom, and IraqI Freedom. Resourcing  these  units  adequately,  however,  negatively affected the Guard's ability to fund its enhanced separate brigades and divisional units, which degraded their readiness.

The Guard's divisions successfully met mission requirements and supported the war on terrorism during FY 2003. But the increased number  of  mobilizations  and  deployments,  a  shortage  of  full-time support, and funding shortfalls led to a decline in the personnel and training readiness of the Guard's divisions. Due to this decline, post-

mobilization  training  levels  and  the  overall  readiness  of  these  units remained below acceptable levels. Unit resources and training levels within the Army National Guard's eight divisions dropped 10.6 percent during the year because of decreases in skill qualification levels, equipment serviceability, and training readiness.

## Mobilization

At the start of October 2002, the Army National Guard and Army Reserve had nearly 35,000 soldiers mobilized. A year later, more than 127,000 troops from the reserve components were mobilized.

During the fiscal year, the Army National Guard provided ready units in support of an array of overseas and domestic missions and was busier than it had been at any other point since the Korean War, when it mobilized eight divisions.  Traditionally,  the  Army  National Guard had employed approximately 10 percent of its force overseas to support the requirements of combatant commanders. In FY 2003, 21 percent of the force provided support, mainly in combat operations.

The Army National Guard deployed over 38,000 soldiers, including seven infantry battalions from enhanced separate brigades, in support of Operation IraqI Freedom . In addition to participating in combat operations, guardsmen performed logistical, military intelligence, military policing, explosive ordnance disposal, medical, civil affairs, and engineering tasks. More than 8,000 troops also supported Operation endurIng Freedom , force protection missions in Europe, and detainee operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In Afghanistan, Guard troops helped  to  train  the  Afghan  National  Army  and  conducted  Special Forces  operations.  In  the  Balkans,  2,814  soldiers  from  twenty-two states were engaged in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, while 1,781 soldiers  from  twenty  states  supported  peacekeeping  operations  in Kosovo. The Army National Guard supplied two military police units to protect U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and an infantry battalion for force protection support to air defense artillery units in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In addition, Guard units conducted the Multinational Force and Observers mission in the Sinai Peninsula.

At home, the Army National Guard expended 419,463 man-days in assistance to civilian authorities. Guard soldiers distributed water, removed  debris,  and  supplied  security  and  traffic  control  services following Supertyphoon Pongsona in Guam. They also assisted state

and  local  officials  following  Hurricane  Lili,  Hurricane  Isabel,  and other destructive weather events in the continental United States. In the wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, hundreds of Guard troops from five states helped to recover and safeguard shuttle debris that  was  strewn  across  parts  of  Texas  and  Louisiana.  The  Army National Guard also continued to help with homeland defense operations, assisting local law enforcement at special events throughout the country and guarding airports, bridges, tunnels, and nuclear sites. Some 17,000 Guard troops provided force protection support to U.S. Army installations, as well as to 148 U.S. Air Force, Air Reserve, and Air National Guard installations. The Army National Guard's thirty-two weapons of mass destruction (WMD) civil support teams responded to seventy-four requests for support from civil authorities for actual or potential WMD incidents.

## Federal Reserve Restructuring Initiative

The Army Reserve launched a major restructuring effort in FY 2003. The Army's heavy reliance on reserve units in the Global War on Terrorism placed great demands on reservists and revealed weaknesses in a reserve mobilization system and force structure designed during the Cold War for large-scale combat operations. In mid-2003, the chief of  the  Army  Reserve,  Lt.  Gen.  James  R.  Helmly,  described  recent mobilizations  as  'lethargic,  slow,  cumbersome  and  weighted  with redundancies and multiple stops along the way.' Mobilizing reservists had encountered other problems and inefficiencies as well, including last-minute notices regarding upcoming deployments. Because many high-demand combat support and combat service support capabilities-among them, medical support, military police, and civil affairswere found primarily in reserve units, the Army had also mobilized some reservists multiple times in a short span of time.

To  address  these  problems,  General  Helmly  introduced  the Federal  Reserve  Restructuring  Initiative  to  transform  the  Army Reserve.  The  initiative  had  six  parts  or  'imperatives.'  First,  the Army Reserve planned to reengineer the mobilization process. An important  change  would  alter  the  process  used  to  mobilize  units. Under  the  existing  system  a  unit  was  alerted,  mobilized,  trained, and  then  deployed.  In  the  future,  the  Army  Reserve  intended  to match the active component deployment process, which followed a train-alert-deploy pattern. Units would complete all administrative, medical, logistical, and training requirements prior to receiving an alert to mobilize and therefore would be able to deploy more quickly. Second,  the  Army  Reserve  intended  to  develop  a  command  and

control  structure  that  produced  ready  soldiers  and  units.  It  began work on this imperative already in 2003 when it replaced its regional support  commands with regional  readiness  commands  focused  on training,  readiness,  mobilization,  and  leader  development.  Third, it planned to restructure units, eliminating types of units that were rarely or never mobilized and reorganizing them into units necessary to  meet  expected  mission  requirements  for  the  continuing  Global War on Terrorism. Fourth, the Army Reserve planned to improve its human resources. Among other initiatives, new personnel centers at each of the regional readiness commands would enable reservists to deal with personnel issues directly, rather than working through their individual units and chains of command. Fifth, it intended to implement a predictable and sustainable rotation based on depth in capability. Army Reserve leaders hoped to build a capability-to-need ratio that would ensure that a reservist would only have to deploy once every five years. Sixth, the Army Reserve planned to improve individual support to combatant commanders by increasing the number of trained and ready soldiers in critical military occupational specialties available for deployment as individual augmentees.

## Materiel and Aviation

During  FY  2003,  the  Army  National  Guard  made  significant progress in modernizing its fifteen enhanced separate brigades, particularly in fielding the M1A1 Abrams tank, M2A2ODS Bradley fighting vehicle, and M109A6 Paladin howitzer. But Guard divisions still had significant  shortages  of  tactical  wheeled  vehicles,  Single  Channel Ground  and  Airborne  Radio  System  (SINCGARS)  radios,  rotary wing  aircraft,  night-vision  devices,  and  engineer  equipment,  among other items.

The Army National Guard's aviation modernization and transformation  efforts  were  focused  on  completing  extensive  changes to  unit  organizational  designs.  The  Army  National  Guard  also continued to turn in obsolete UH-1 and OH-58 helicopters and to field  modern  UH-60 Black Hawks and AH-64 Apaches. It added eight UH-60s and seventeen AH-64s, including two of the advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow models, to its net inventory of modernized aircraft. The total number of these aircraft remained below the level the Army wanted to attain, however. In addition, most of the supporting and corrective actions scheduled and funded for FY 2003, such as the acquisition of more special tools and spare parts, were effectively  negated  by  the  increased  requirements  of  contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

During FY 2003, the Army National Guard mobilized units in several  states  to  support  homeland  defense  and  the  Global  War  on Terrorism,  and  some  of  these  units  needed  to  improve  their  readiness  ratings.  To  alleviate  shortages,  the  National  Guard  repaired equipment,  shared  equipment  between  states,  and  used  National Guard  and  Reserve  Equipment  Appropriation  procurements.  The annual National Guard and Reserve Equipment Appropriation from Congress provided funding for the direct procurement of equipment and  therefore  afforded  the  Guard  the  flexibility  to  address  critical shortfalls and modernize high-priority units. By contrast, the majority of Army equipment procurement for the National Guard filled shortages for force structure changes. The Army National Guard valued the new procurement offset at approximately $70 million.

## Family Assistance and Employer Support

In February 2003, the Army National Guard was operating 208 Family  Assistance  Centers  throughout  the  country,  but  concluded that  400  centers  were  necessary  to  meet  the  needs  of  all  families with deployed soldiers. Accordingly, it transferred $13 million of its Operations and Maintenance funding from other internal programs to finance this critical need. By the end of the fiscal year, the Army National Guard had added 190 new Family Assistance Centers, for a total of 398. Family assistance was intended to ease concerns and help solve problems, with an institutional goal of establishing contact with all family members affected by a deployment or mobilization.

The Army National Guard budget for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve increased from $4.2 million to $9.7 million in FY 2003. These funds supported a variety of programs at the local level, including employer outreach events such as Briefings with the Boss, Statement of Support signings, and annual awards banquets recognizing supportive employers.



## Management and Planning

On 1 October 2002, the Army Materiel Command created a new provisional  major  subordinate  command,  the  Research,  Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), to guide and align the Army's science and technology programs. When formally established as a permanent entity in FY 2004, the new command encompassed the Army Research Laboratory, the Army Research Office, and the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity, as well as the research, development, and engineering centers of all the Army Materiel Command's major subordinate commands. Army leaders sought to achieve three primary goals in creating RDECOM: to supply soldiers with emerging technologies more quickly; to enable the service to rapidly take advantage of technological opportunities wherever they arose; and to better integrate research, development, and engineering across all areas of the Army and expand working relationships with other Army elements and outside interests, such as industry and academia.

On  7  July  2003,  the  Army  Materiel  Command  completed  the deployment of the first phase of its Logistics Modernization Program (LMP), which was designed to modernize the Army's national-level logistics business practices and supporting information technology. By modernizing and integrating some thirty existing logistics databases that  relied  on  old  technologies,  LMP  was  to  provide  an  automated system with real-time capabilities for managing wholesale and retail inventories.  When  fully  implemented,  it  would  offer  a  single  point of entry for the recording, reporting, and analysis of inventory and related financial data.

The new program was a key element of the Army's transformation campaign, and service officials expected it to improve readiness. They believed the program would reduce the time soldiers in the field had to wait between ordering supplies and delivery and would help to  ensure  that  items  were  in  stock  when  ordered.  Moreover,  orders would be visible from start to finish, resulting in fewer lost orders. The Army also expected LMP to improve logistics planning and to enable the service to spend less on buying and storing items, as items could

be more easily ordered direct from the factory. In addition, it would decrease the number of personnel required for logistics management and operations.

The service  deployed  LMP  to  twelve  pilot  locations  in  the  first phase.  These  included  the  U.S.  Army  Communications-Electronics Command, the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, the Army Materiel  Command's  headquarters  and  staff,  the  Tobyhanna  Army Depot,  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service,  and  the  field office of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command in Philadelphia.

## Operation iraqi freeDoM

The logistics aspects of the war in Iraq began during the summer of 2002 with the movement of weapons systems, ammunition, and other materiel, mostly from pre-positioned stocks abroad. In December, the Army also launched an information systems initiative to swiftly field a new logistics capability to support current operations and, as a result, in  February  introduced  the  Logistics  Common  Operating  Picture (LCOP), a system to provide commanders with near real-time logistics asset management and decision support tools. The LCOP integrated three  existing  concepts:  in-transit  visibility,  which  provided  movement tracking of supplies from the continental United States to the theater and on to support activities; the Integrated Logistics Analysis Program, which served as a data warehouse, combining supply, finance, maintenance,  and  distribution  information  from  legacy  systems  at hundreds  of  locations;  and  the  Joint  Deployment  Logistics  Model, which provided automated analysis to permit modeling, data mining, and graphical representation of information.

In addition to relying heavily on digitization in logistics support during  Operation IraqI  Freedom ,  the  Army  for  the  first  time  used significant quantities of pre-positioned stocks of combat equipment and supplies to fight a war. Department of Defense reliance on prepositioned reserves had grown after the end of the Cold War when the United States could no longer plan on having a large forward troop presence. The Army and the U.S. Marine Corps had stored pre-positioned stocks on ships and on land in Southwest Asia and other regions of the world to enable a rapid response to conflicts, since only troops and a small amount of materiel would need to be transported when they deployed units to a conflict area. These reserves now provided a substantial portion of the combat equipment employed by the Army during major combat operations in Iraq. The service used almost all of its pre-positioned ship stocks and its ashore stocks in Kuwait and

Qatar, and it also drew some stocks from Europe. Altogether, these stocks  included  more  than  10,000  pieces  of  rolling  stock,  670,000 repair parts, 3,000 containers, and thousands of additional pieces of other equipment.

Pre-positioned stocks were a key factor in the Army's success in Iraq. The stocks generally proved to be in good condition and performed well. Problems did surface, however, though they were not insuperable. Some equipment was outdated and therefore required units to adapt or to bring along their own. The stocks included 1960s-vintage trucks, for instance, which were harder to repair than modern trucks and had manual transmissions,  posing  challenges  for  maintenance  personnel and drivers accustomed to automatic transmissions. Additionally, the Army had shortages  of  trucks,  spare  parts,  and  other  items.  These contributed to supply-and-distribution problems, which were further magnified when soldiers were unaware of what pre-positioned sustainment stocks were available in theater.

Army logisticians ultimately provided operational forces in Iraq what they needed, despite lines of communication stretching more than 400 kilometers from Kuwait to Baghdad, and major combat operations were a success. But early analyses nevertheless pointed to significant logistics

support problems in theater, both during and after major combat operations. The U.S. General Accounting Office, for example, was completing a preliminary study of defense logistics as FY 2003 ended and cited the following issues: 'a backlog of hundreds of pallets and containers of materiel at various distribution points'; 'a discrepancy of $1.2 billion between materiel shipped to Army activities in  the  theater  of  operations  and  the  amount  of  materiel  that  those  activities  acknowledged they received'; 'the cannibalization of vehicles and potential reduction of equipment readiness due to unavailability of parts that either were not in [the Defense Department's] inventory or could not be located'; 'the duplication of many requisitions and circumvention of the supply system';  and  'the  accumulation  at  the  theater  distribution  center  in Kuwait of hundreds of pallets, containers, and boxes of excess supplies and  equipment  that  were  shipped  from  units  redeploying  from  Iraq without  required  content  descriptions  and  shipping  documentation.' The study suggested that a combination of conditions were to blame for the  problems,  including  the  Defense  Department's  '[in]adequate  visibility over all equipment and supplies transported to, within, and from the theater of operations in support of [Operation IraqI Freedom ]'; 'insufficient and ineffective theater distribution capability'; 'failure to apply 'lessons learned' from prior operations'; and 'other conditions, such as insufficient quantities of certain items, inadequate configuration of prepositioned inventory to meet Army unit requirements, and ineffective management of shipping containers.' Defense Department logistics officials generally concurred with these findings.

The  Army  relied  heavily  on  civilian  contractors  for  logistics support during FY 2003. Due to the rapid expansion of operations in the Persian Gulf region, the Army used its Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) on an unprecedented scale. LOGCAP is a  multiyear,  indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity  contract,  held  at the time by Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, which the Army uses to provide logistics support to its deployed combat forces. Under LOGCAP, the contractor has the right to sell goods and services to the Army during a  fixed  period  of  time  at  prices  within  a  negotiated  range,  with  the service issuing specific task orders as needs arise. FY 2003 began and ended  with  LOGCAP  being  employed  for  the  first  time  on  a  truly global basis. The Army utilized it at multiple locations in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, the continental United States, and around the Pacific Rim. Stated in dollar terms, its use in support of Operations endurIng Freedom and IraqI Freedom alone topped $5 billion. At the end of the fiscal year, dollar projections for all LOGCAP customers in the aggregate  exceeded  $10  billion.  The  dramatic  rise  in  expenditures resulted from expanding requirements, rather than from rising costs

or rates. For example, as U.S. Central Command's Combined Forces Land Component Command rotated support units back to the United States, they were replaced with contract capabilities.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

During  the  fall  of  2002,  the  Army's  Program  Executive  Office Soldier (PEO Soldier) launched a new program, the Rapid Fielding Initiative (RFI), which fielded gear and equipment to deploying soldiers more  quickly  than  the  Army's  traditional  acquisition  and  fielding process. Reports from Afghanistan earlier in 2002 had indicated that existing Army fielding plans were not meeting soldier needs, which led soldiers to purchase supplemental equipment and clothing with their own funds. At the direction of Vice Chief of Staff General Keane, PEO Soldier investigated and determined what items soldiers thought were most needed. Disregarding normal Army procedures, the office in October and November procured a supply of fifteen items-primarily off-the-shelf  equipment from commercial suppliers and government sources-sufficient to equip some 3,000 soldiers of the 1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division. PEO Soldier distributed these items to the unit immediately, in mid-November, prior to its December deployment to

Afghanistan. Items fielded included the Advanced Combat Helmet, boots with sturdier soles than the Army's current-issue version, and improved wind and dust goggles and lightweight long underwear that the service had previously only issued to special operations units. The success of the initial action, which cost the Army $11 million, led the service to continue to refine its list of RFI items and to equip seven additional deploying brigades during FY 2003.

During the summer of 2003, General Schoomaker also expanded the mission of the Army's Rapid Equipping Force (REF) and made the  provisional  organization  permanent.  Where  the  RFI  attempted to better equip soldiers before they deployed, the service had established the REF in FY 2002 to meet unforeseen, immediate operational requirements  of  deployed  units,  such  as  the  ability  to  search  caves and wells. The organization dealt only with materiel solutions that it could send to the field, evaluate, and assess within ninety days, and it  achieved  this  goal  by  relying  primarily  on  technologies  that  were already commercially available. The new chief of staff now tasked the REF with also identifying Objective Force capabilities that the Army could put in the field immediately, years before they were scheduled for production. As the director of the REF, Col. Bruce D. Jette, explained, 'He instructed us to take a look at the Army's future force, examining concepts, technologies, surrogates and threshold capabilities to determine if they can be inserted onto the battlefield right now, rather than later.' At the end of FY 2003, the organization was developing a new charter that incorporated these responsibilities.

Among the Army's conventional acquisition programs, two of the most important saw major developments during the fiscal year. Late in 2002, the Army began restructuring its RAH-66 Comanche helicopter program for  the  sixth  time  since  FY  1988.  The  Comanche  was  the service's next-generation armed reconnaissance helicopter and the first helicopter designed and developed expressly for this mission. Under development since 1983, it was to replace the Army's existing fleet of AH-1 Cobra light attack and OH-58 Kiowa Warrior reconnaissance helicopters.  Continuing  performance,  cost,  and  schedule  problems, however, led the Army to revise the program once again in the fall of 2002. In October, Edward 'Pete' Aldridge, the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, signed an acquisition  decision  memorandum  endorsing  the  Army's  revised  program. The  memorandum  granted  the  service  permission  to  continue  the engineering and manufacturing development stage of the program and authorized the purchase of 650 helicopters at a rate of up to 60 per year. This number was just over half the Army's previous goal of 1,213 total aircraft and was also 169 fewer than the Army now believed it

needed to satisfy newly defined Objective Force requirements. Instead, the  650  helicopter  figure  reflected  the  influence  of  a  recent  Defense Planning Guidance study which recommended that the Army employ the  Comanche  primarily  as  a  reconnaissance  asset  and  abandon current  plans  to  also  use  it  as  a  replacement  for  the  service's  main attack  helicopter,  the  AH-64  Apache.  With  this  in  mind,  Aldridge also directed the Army to 'analyze extending the life of the Apache helicopter for the heavy attack mission.' To compensate for a smaller fleet of Comanches, Aldridge instructed the service to submit a plan for funding the development of a companion unmanned aerial vehicle system for the aircraft.  In  December,  he  signed  a  program  decision memorandum allocating funding from the Comanche program to the unmanned aerial vehicle effort and an Apache upgrade project.

Looking further into the future, the Army's FCS program significantly  expanded  its  contracting  base  during  the  last  quarter  of  the fiscal year. The lead systems integrator team for the program, a partnership of Boeing and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), announced the selection of twenty-one industry partners to lead FCS program development areas during its system development  and  demonstration  phase.  The  program  development  areas ranged from classes of unmanned air and ground vehicles to system support  packages.  Each  partner  was  to  function  as  its  own  'lead

technology integrator,' working with Boeing-SAIC and the Army to assess proposal packages for subsystems within its area, but ultimately making its own selections.

Seeking to utilize biotechnology in innovative ways, the Army in August 2003 also announced the establishment of a new universityaffiliated  research  center  at  the  University  of  California  at  Santa Barbara. The Army Research Office awarded a grant worth up to $50  million  over  five  years  to  a  partnership  among  researchers  at the  university,  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology,  and  the California  Institute  of  Technology  to  establish  the  Institute  for Collaborative Biotechnologies. The institute would conduct unclassified  research  aimed  at  understanding  biological  mechanisms  and applying that knowledge to the design and fabrication of new and enhanced materials, devices, and systems.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Given the frequency and duration of troop deployments in FY 2003 and preceding years, supporting the immediate needs of soldiers and  their  families  was  the  paramount  concern  of  Army  morale, welfare,  and  recreation  (MWR)  personnel.  During  the  fiscal  year, twenty-eight emergency-essential civilian specialists managed MWR programs at twenty-four locations in the Balkans, while seven civilian specialists  deployed  to  Operation endurIng  Freedom and  Operation IraqI  Freedom :  one  in  Uzbekistan,  two  in  Afghanistan,  three in Kuwait, and one in Qatar. In addition, the Army Community and Family Support Center purchased and delivered $13.5 million worth of MWR equipment, supplies, and services for soldiers and civilians deployed in support of operations in Southwest Asia. The equipment helped commanders to outfit fitness and recreation facilities at fortytwo sites in Iraq and eight sites in Afghanistan. Large MWR kits, for units of 1,000-1,500 soldiers, included free weights, basketball goals, board games, and other interactive components. Small unit kits, for units of 100 personnel or less, included footballs, basketballs, exercise bands, board games, and cards. Each month, 800 paperback book kits were delivered to Operation endurIng Freedom and Operation IraqI Freedom units,  along with audiobooks, magazines, music CDs, and the Army Times .

At home, Army Community Service personnel helped to set up Family  Assistance  Centers  and  conducted  predeployment  briefings and  training  for  Rear  Detachment  commanders,  Family  Readiness Group leaders, and Family Assistance Team members. They coordinated community support from key support agencies such as chaplains,  Army  Emergency  Relief,  and  TRICARE;  managed  volunteer networks; and provided installation-wide homecoming, reunion, and counseling services.

In FY 2003, $1.4 billion in total appropriated and nonappropriated  funding  supported  MWR  operating  and  capital  requirements. This  represented  a  decrease  of  $46  million  from  FY  2002.  A  $20 million reduction in appropriated funds was due mainly to a sizable

cut in Army military construction funds, offset by an increase in Army operations and maintenance funding. The reduction in nonappropriated funds was chiefly the product of decreased Army and Air Force Exchange Service payments to the Army and a decline in gross revenue from  the  Army  Recreation  Machine  Program.  The  largest  share  of MWR funding-53 percent-went toward personnel costs.

## Installations and Infrastructure

To  maintain  its  warfighting  readiness,  the  Army  traditionally  had accepted substantial risk in infrastructure. A decade of chronic underfunding, however, had produced a situation in which more than 50 percent of Army facilities and infrastructure were in such poor condition that in FY 2002 commanders rated them as 'adversely affecting mission requirements.' In recent years, Army leaders had begun to address this problem through improved funding and new business practices, and FY 2003 saw a continuation of this trend. The Army's FY 2003 budget request funded sustainment, restoration, and modernization at more than 90 percent of requirements.  The  service's  request  for  FY  2004  increased  funding  for facilities sustainment to 93 percent of requirements.

In FY 2003, the Army also changed how it managed its installations. During the year, funds for installation maintenance and improvement went  directly  to  the  service's  new  Installation  Management  Agency (IMA), rather than to the major commands that previously ran the installations.  Moreover, these funds could no longer be migrated to other accounts to make up training or operational funding shortfalls without Department of the Army approval. As a result, only about $5 million was moved to cover operational shortages during the fiscal year, compared with several hundred million dollars the year before. To reduce inequities among installations, the IMA also developed and issued common standards for services (Army Baseline Services) and infrastructure (Installation Design Standards). The design standards were to provide a framework for a design guide for each installation, which  would  be  a  key  component  of  installation  master  planning. Finally,  under  the  new  structure,  garrison  commanders  and  their staffs, rather than the senior mission commander on site, had responsibility for managing installation support services, freeing up mission commanders to focus instead on the operations of their units.

To improve housing for soldiers and their families, the Army partnered with the private sector. In 1996, the Military Housing Privatization Initiative Act authorized the military services to obtain privatesector capital and expertise to operate, manage, maintain, improve, and build military housing in the United States. In response, the Army had

introduced a Residential Communities Initiative (RCI), which enabled the service to enter into contracts with private real estate developers to build integrated communities that included both redeveloped older housing and new houses constructed to private-sector standards, as well as community centers, pools, retail concerns, and town squares. The  program  had  begun  with  pilot  projects  at  Fort  Carson,  Fort Hood, Fort Lewis, and Fort Meade, and on 1 August 2003, the Army transferred  responsibility  for  on-post  housing  at  Fort  Bragg,  North Carolina, to a private-sector firm. At the end of FY 2003, the RCI process was also under way at twenty-one other locations, with partners selected and transfer dates scheduled for ten of them. Together, the  fifteen  projects  the  Army  had  awarded  to  private  firms  to  date accounted for more than 51,000 new or renovated housing units.

The Army also made progress in its utilities privatization program, which  involved  transferring  ownership,  maintenance,  and  repair of  utility  infrastructure  to  qualified  municipal,  regional,  or  private providers. During the fiscal year, the service privatized twenty additional systems, including seven electric, five natural gas, four water, and four wastewater systems. By October 2003, the Army had transferred

ownership of 215 of 589 systems in Europe and 83 of 351 systems in the United States. Negotiations were ongoing regarding nearly 100 other systems. These figures, however, fell well short of the service's original goal of completing all privatization efforts by that time. It had therefore also established a tiger team, the Army Utilities Privatization Team, to streamline the process and help maintain the program's forward momentum.

Of 250,000 acres of land remaining for divestiture as a result of past Base Realignment and Closure initiatives, the Army transferred 130,000  acres  to  public  or  private  use  during  the  fiscal  year.  This amount was more than the total number of acres the Army had turned over since 1988.

## Safety

The Army lost 261 soldiers to accidents in FY 2003, sixty more than during FY 2002. The greatest killer continued to be accidents involving personally owned vehicles, which accounted for 110 deaths, or 42 percent of the total. Thirty-six deaths resulted from Army motor vehicle  accidents  and  sixteen  from  Army  combat  vehicle  accidents, tripling  the  numbers  recorded  in  each  category  during  the  previous fiscal  year.  Thirty-four  deaths  resulted  from  aviation  operations,  or twice  as  many  as  the  year  before.  Other  accidental  deaths  included fifty-seven from personal injury accidents such as falls and recreation incidents.

The Army reported 2,107 Class A, B, and C accidents in FY 2003. Aviation accidents accounted for 130 of these, or one less than the previous year. These included 29 Class A accidents (involving damages of $1 million or more, destroyed or missing aircraft, or injury or illness resulting  in  death  or  permanent  total  disability).  Ground  accidents accounted  for  1,977  of  the  total,  including  257  Class  A  accidents. While  the  number  of  ground  accidents  increased  by  just  forty-four over FY 2002, this figure included seventy-three additional Class A accidents, forty-nine additional Class B accidents, and seventy-eight fewer Class C accidents.

Of  the  227  soldiers  who  died  in  ground  accidents,  100,  or  44 percent,  were  on  duty  at  the  time,  compared  with  forty-five  of  184 soldiers, or 24 percent, in FY 2002. The director of the Army Safety Center, Brig. Gen. Joseph A. Smith, attributed the rise in on-duty accidental deaths partly to the number of troops moving in and out of various theaters, which increased the likelihood of accidents. At the end of the fiscal year, the center was undertaking studies to ascertain the reasons for the rise.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  operated under  a  different  fiscal  year  system  than  the  Army.  During  its  FY 2002, which ended on 1 February 2003, AAFES' total revenue was $7.3  million,  with  net  earnings  of  $415.5  million.  Dividends  to  the Army's morale, welfare, and recreation programs totaled $132 million, down $14 million from the preceding year. The exchange service's total revenue rose to $7.9 million during its FY 2003, which ended on 31 January 2004. Net earnings for the period totaled $485 million, while dividends  to  the  Army's  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation  programs improved to $137 million.

AAFES expanded its presence in Qatar, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and eventually Iraq from twelve stores to more than seventy-five during FY 2003. Overall, the organization's sales increased as a result of operations in Southeast Asia. In FY 2002, approximately $52,569, or 0.7 percent, of its net revenues derived from sales to U.S. troops stationed in the Operation endurIng Freedom and Operation IraqI Freedom regions. The following year, some $415,610, or 5.3 percent, of its net revenues came from this source.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

The  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Civil  Works  Program  provided for  nationwide  water  resources  development  and  management.  The program carried out investigations and surveys, engineering and design, construction,  and  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  flood  control, navigation, environmental restoration, and hydroelectric power projects, as well as recreation sites. The Corps of Engineers regulated the discharge of dredged and fill material into waters of the United States and supported improvements in flood control, storm damage prevention, and navigation. It also cleaned up contaminated defense sites and supplied disaster relief services.

The Corps executed its civil works mission through eight regional divisions  and  thirty-eight  of  its  forty-one  districts,  employing  more than 25,000 people. Ninety-five percent of these employees worked at the  district  level  and  most  were  civilians.  The  Civil  Works  Program contracted out all of its construction and roughly 50 percent of its design  work  to  civilian  companies,  indirectly  employing  as  many as  150,000  additional  people.  Funded  not  by  Defense  Department dollars, but by congressional appropriations for civil works projects, the program received $4.738 billion in direct appropriations for FY 2003.

In  February  2003,  the  program  established  an  Office  of  Homeland Security to carry out numerous responsibilities associated with civil  emergency  management  and  critical  infrastructure  protection programs. Key among these was the office's responsibility for coordinating Corps of Engineers support with elements of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the Army in conducting the overall homeland security mission.

In September 2003, the Corps assigned 228 employees to its disaster response effort for Hurricane Isabel, the largest hurricane of the fiscal year. Packing maximum sustained winds of a hundred miles per hour, the  hurricane  caused  widespread  power  outages  in  the  District  of Columbia, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. The Corps' Norfolk District provided the primary contribution to the emergency operation

within its Civil Works boundaries in Virginia. The Baltimore District had similar responsibilities in Maryland and Washington, D.C.

## Environmental Protection

During the spring of 2003, Army leaders approved two documents intended to guide the service's future environmental cleanup efforts. In April, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment Mario P. Fiori signed the Army Environmental Cleanup Strategy, which provided the Army with a roadmap to realize its environmental cleanup vision. The service's vision statement affirmed that it would be  'a  national  leader  in  cleaning  up  contaminated  land  to  protect human health and the environment as an integral part of its mission.' In May, Maj. Gen. Larry J. Lust, Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), signed the Army Environmental Cleanup Strategic Plan, which described targets and success indicators to make certain that objectives contained in the strategy were being achieved.

This  was  the  first  time  one  strategy  document  identified  common objectives  to  ensure  consistency  and  accountability  across  the  service's various  cleanup  programs.  These  objectives  included  ensuring  prompt action  to  address  imminent  and  substantial  threats  to  human  health, public safety, and the environment; complying with applicable statutes, regulations, and other external requirements; ensuring that Army regulations and policies were developed within the framework of the strategy; planning, programming, budgeting, and executing cleanups in accordance with  Defense  Department  and  Army  directives  using  validated,  auditable,  site-level  data;  developing  cleanup  partnerships  with  appropriate authorities;  promoting  public  stakeholder  participation  in  the  cleanup process and making site-level cleanup information available to the public; supporting the development and use of cost-effective cleanup approaches and technologies; and performing semiannual reviews of cleanup progress and periodic reviews of sites where contamination remained in place.

The strategic plan was organized around seven cleanup program areas: Army Active Installation Restoration, Army Excess Installations Restoration, Army Base Realignment and Closure Cleanup, Formerly Utilized Defense Sites, Army Compliance-Related Cleanup, Army Special Installations Cleanup, and Army Remediation Overseas. It assigned management responsibility for all cleanup program areas under ACSIM to the Office of  the  Director  of  Environmental  Programs,  Environmental  Cleanup Division, and was to be implemented by program managers within five organizations, including the U.S. Army Environmental Center, the Base Realignment and Closure Office within ACSIM, the Corps of Engineers, the Installation Management Agency, and the Army National Guard.

## Legal Affairs

In FY 2003, the number of courts-martial decreased to the lowest level since FY 1999, after five years where both the number of courtsmartial and their complexity had trended upward. Table 8 shows the sentences  adjudicated  during  FY  2003.  The  Army  Judge  Advocate General's Corps attributed the decline largely to the ongoing operations  associated  with  Operation endurIng Freedom and  Operation IraqI  Freedom .  The  number  of  nonjudicial  punishments  imposed under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was 43,037, for a rate of 87.1 per thousand.

Overseas operations influenced legal work in the Army in other ways  as  well.  The  U.S.  Army  Trial  Defense  Service  supplied  assistance to deployed forces around the world, including those in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq,  and  Kuwait.  To  provide  a  management and  supervisory  attorney  structure  for  defense  services  in  Iraq,  the Judge Advocate General approved the establishment of a provisional U.S. Army Trial Defense Service Region XI in July 2003. At the end of the fiscal year, twelve defense attorneys and ten enlisted paralegals were deployed to various areas of Iraq.

Military  judges  presided  over  the  trials  of  all  special  and  general courts-martial  worldwide.  Eighteen  active  duty  and  fourteen  Army Reserve judges tried courts-martial in remote locations, including Kuwait and Iraq, as well as in military courtrooms throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Korea. The Army called three Army Reserve judges to active duty to assist with anticipated caseload increases caused partly by the call to active duty of Army Reserve and Army National Guard personnel. Trials of soldiers in Iraq and Kuwait began shortly after major combat operations ended there and increased in number over the summer and fall. The Army also called two judicial clerks to active duty to assist in preparing materials for possible use in trials by military commissions and in courts-martial of enemy prisoners of war.

## Chemical Demilitarization

In 1985, the U.S. Congress had directed the Defense Department to destroy the nation's stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions and tasked the Army with carrying out this mission. Seven years later, Congress had instructed the service to plan for destroying U.S. nonstockpile chemical munitions as well. During FY 2003, the Army reorganized its management apparatus for these efforts. Secretary of the  Army  Thomas  White  transferred  overall  responsibility  for  the chemical  demilitarization  program  from  the  assistant  secretary  of the Army for installations and environment to the assistant secretary of  the  Army  for  acquisition,  logistics,  and  technology,  effective  18 February 2003. The Army also created a Chemical Materials Agency, which combined under a single activity the chemical weapons storage functions formerly handled by the U.S. Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Command and the demilitarization functions of the service's Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization. The director of the new agency was dual-hatted, reporting to the assistant secretary of the  Army  for  acquisition,  logistics,  and  technology,  for  acquisition functions  relating  to  the  construction  of  demilitarization  facilities and  reporting  to  the  commanding  general  of  the  Army  Materiel Command for functions relating to the storage and destruction  of chemical munitions.

During the fiscal year, the Army also reached key milestones at two  facilities.  The  accelerated  neutralization  of  the  bulk  chemical agent stockpile in Aberdeen, Maryland, began in April 2003, and in August 2003 an incineration facility began destroying chemical munitions stored at the Anniston Army Depot in Alabama.

In  October  2002,  Congress  assigned  the  Assembled  Chemical Weapons  Assessment  (ACWA)  program  responsibility  for  destroying

chemical  munitions  stored  at  the  Army's  Pueblo  Chemical  Depot  in Colorado and at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. Congress had established the ACWA program in 1996 to identify and demonstrate technologies other than incineration for destroying assembled chemical weapons.  The  program  operated  separately  from  the  Army's  demilitarization effort and reported directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In July 2002, the Defense Department had approved a new destruction technology, neutralization followed by biotreatment, for the chemical weapons stored in Colorado, and in early February 2003, it approved the use of neutralization followed by supercritical water oxidation for the destruction of the chemical weapons stored in Kentucky. Although the ACWA program was responsible for these operations, the Army's new Chemical Materials Agency received authority to ensure the  secure  storage  of  the  nation's  entire  chemical  weapons  stockpile, including weapons stored at the Colorado and Kentucky depots.

## Army Audit Agency

During FY 2003, the Army Audit Agency published 369 reports with 860 recommendations that represented $798 million in potential monetary savings for the Army. Key activities during the year were the agency's audits in the areas of third-party claims and distance-learning courseware  development  and  facilities.  Audits,  for  instance,  showed that  Army  medical  centers  needed  to  improve  procedures  both  for identifying and billing for outpatient care and ancillary services and for collecting, following up, and resolving unpaid third-party claims. Audits also showed that TRADOC needed to improve processes for prioritizing and developing distance-learning courseware and, together with the National Guard Bureau, for determining the requirements for distance-learning training facilities.

In addition to providing auditing services, the Army Audit Agency had  supplied  consulting  services  to  the  Army  since  the  late  1990s. However, recent changes in the General Accounting Office's Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards now limited audit organizations from providing auditing and nonaudit services to the same client. The agency therefore issued its last consulting services report in 2003.

## Smallpox Vaccinations

Concerned that adversaries would use the smallpox virus as a biological weapon against the United States or its deployed military personnel, President Bush announced the creation of a national smallpox vaccination program on 13 December 2002. The president assigned responsibility for

implementing the program's military component to the Department of Defense, which appointed the Army to oversee these activities. The Army's Military  Vaccine  Agency  developed  clinical  guidelines  for  the  Defense Department, and the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency's Distribution Operations Center coordinated the distribution of the smallpox vaccine within the department.

Defense officials carried out the vaccination program in three stages. During December 2002, medical officials initiated a pilot program in which they vaccinated and monitored health care personnel at four Defense  Department  sites,  including  Walter  Reed  Army  Medical Center,  Washington,  D.C.,  and  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground,  Maryland. In January 2003, they began a full-scale implementation of the program in two stages based on priority. Health care providers were vaccinated  during  the  first  stage.  During  the  second  stage,  medical officials expanded their efforts to include critical mission and support personnel,  namely,  those  who  were  deployed  or  assigned  overseas, those who would be expected to deploy in a contingency, and those who supported contingency forces when they deployed. Due to deployments

to the Persian Gulf region, the two implementation stages overlapped and health care providers vaccinated thousands of military personnel in a short period. By early summer, they were vaccinating only about 1,000 military personnel per week, targeting hospital staffs and troops scheduled to support operations in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. As of early October 2003, the Army had inoculated 225,869 individuals.

## September 11 Memorial

After the FY 2002 National Defense Authorization Act provided authority for the secretary of defense to establish a memorial for the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, the Corps of Engineers had signed an agreement with the Defense Department's Washington  Headquarters  Services  according  to  which  the  Corps  would provide the necessary planning, site selection, design, and related technical services. In June 2002, the Corps had therefore launched an international design competition for the memorial, which was to be built on the Pentagon Reservation near the site where American Airlines Flight  77  crashed  into  the  building  causing  184  deaths.  In  October, after reviewing more than 1,100 entries, an eleven-member jury that included artists, architects, former defense secretaries, and a victim's

family member chose six finalists. On 3 March 2003, Terry Riley, chief curator  of  architecture  and  design  at  the  Museum  of  Modern  Art in New York and chair of the jury, announced that architects Keith Kaseman and Julie Beckman had won the competition. Their design called for 184 benches, each engraved with the name of a victim and mounted over an illuminated reflecting pool. The benches would be arranged in  age  lines,  starting  with  the  youngest  victim,  and  maple trees planted nearby would eventually produce the feel of a park.

## 9 Conclusion

During FY 2003, the Army continued to plan for its long-term future, but also took steps toward becoming a very different force in the  present.  The  service  carried  on  with  its  transformation  process, spelling  out  what  the  Army  of  2015  would  look  like,  preparing  to deploy  its  first  Stryker  brigade  combat  team,  and  investing  heavily in  science  and  technology  and  research  and  development  programs intended to equip its future force. However, the immediate demands of  two  conflicts  in  Southwest  Asia  and  a  growing  recognition  that large numbers of active and reserve forces would be deployed overseas for the foreseeable future increasingly impacted Army priorities and decision making. Army leaders introduced new personnel policies and programs  for  soldiers  and  offered  additional  assistance  to  families challenged by the long-term deployment of loved ones. As the year drew to a close, even more significant changes were in the early stages, as the Army began to implement a new manning system and launched a plan to redesign its forces.

In  late  July,  General  Schoomaker  described  the  nation's  Global War on Terrorism as 'a war that reaches to the furthest corners of the world-a war for the very survival of our way of life.' This war, he  told  the  Senate  Armed  Services  Committee  at  his  confirmation hearing, would be a long one. Under these conditions, the Army would see both change and continuity, and it would need to adapt. 'We must adjust our priorities,' he argued. 'We may even need to change our culture.  In  a  world  where  the  strategic  environment  is  transformed, we  should  be  prepared  to  even  reexamine  our  fundamental  way  of thinking.' During the fiscal year, the Army began to make strides in this direction.
