## Introduction

Fiscal year (FY) 1993 was a year of challenges and transition for the U.S. Army. In the wake of the end of the Cold War, the service struggled to maintain its readiness while redefining itself for future operations. "America's Army," as Army Chief of Staff (CSA) General Gordon R. Sullivan referred to it, was in the midst of reducing its end strength from approximately 611,000 to 572,000 during the course of the fiscal year, as well as experiencing the strains of a changing institution. In the post-Cold War era, the Army was still feeling the impact of having been through a 25 percent cut in the size of the active force; a one-third reduction in the number of major combat units through the inactivation of one corps and four divisions; and the closure of eighty-two installations and the realignment of another twelve under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) directives. After nearly five decades, the Army was also reducing its presence in Germany, cutting back on the forces that we re once part of its frontline defenses. A soldier returning to Germany in FY 1993 after a five-year absence would immediately notice the changes. Since 1989 one of the Army's two Europebased corps had fought a war in Southwest Asia and then returned to Germany for inactivation. Other divisions and units that had spent years in Germany were also inactivated or returned to the United States, while hundreds of installations that had served as Americans' home away from home were vacated and returned to the host nation.

One of the Army's greatest challenges during the fiscal year concerned the continued transition from a forward-deployed force to a power-projection force, keeping most forces in the continental United States and relying on increased strategic air and sea lift assets to rapidly move units to trouble spots. The Army reexamined where its forces were stationed and moved them to posts with access to the best transportation and training facilities. The reduced need for military installations also brought another round of base closures for the service to manage.

As Army end strength continued to decline in FY 1993, operational deployments remained on the rise. Army soldiers were engaged in a variety of missions that included nation building, counterdrug activities, and

3

disaster and humanitarian relief. The Army termed these missions operations other than war (OOTW), since Army soldiers were not actively engaged in hostile actions. There were at least 20,000 soldiers deployed overseas on more than 1,000 operational missions during the fiscal year. These deployments represented a 100 percent increase from the previous fiscal year. On 17 January 1993, for example, the 10th Mountain Division (Fort Drum, New York) and supporting units were on a peace-making mission in Somalia, while a reinforced battalion task force from the 1st Cavalry Division (Fort Hood, Texas) deployed to Kuwait in two days to meet a possible threat from Iraq.

In March 1993 John W. Shannon, the Acting Secretary of the Army, and General Sullivan issued the Army's annual posture statement, which outlined the Army's goals to maintain a "strategic force capable of decisive victory." The posture statement proclaimed the service's commitment to training and readiness for its active, reserve, and civilian components in support of being prepared to deploy anywhere in the world to accomplish national interests with complete success. To achieve these goals, the Army increased its efficiency. For instance, the creation of the provisional position of Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) streamlined control of Army facilities to raise the quality of life on installations and thereby improve productivity, aid retention, and increase combat readiness. Along these lines, the Army developed the Installation Status Report during the fiscal year as a means for the Chief of Staff to monitor the fitness of the Army's existing infrastructure. Army leaders also benefited from the ongoing development of automation programs, including the Army Tactical Command and Control System (ATCCS), a comprehensive approach to automating Army command and control systems with improved communications. The modern-day Louisiana Maneuvers (LAM), which enabled Army leaders to seek new approaches to solving Army-wide problems such as battlefield digitization, continued. During the fiscal year the Army also revised its war-fighting doctrine, FM 100-5, Operations , to keep pace with post-Cold War changes such as force projection and participation in OOTW.

The challenges of declining budgets, a smaller force, and time spent away from training due to OOTW deployments pressed the Army to maximize the quality of training at every level of the training base. During the fiscal year the Army continued to reorganize the training support structure and to introduce new training to active and reserve component units. For example, the Total Army Training Strategy was an important measure intended to provide enhanced collective and institutional training support to the Total Army.

In an effort to eradicate unnecessary obstacles to service and increase readiness, the Army expanded opportunities for women in FY 1993. A

4

change in Department of Defense policy expanded the role of women in the military. In response to guidance from the Secretary of Defense to the services to open more specialties and assignment opportunities to women, the Army opened more than 9,000 new positions to women in combat aviation assignments during the fiscal year and examined opening additional positions in the future.

As reduced budgets and downsizing presented Army leaders with difficult choices during the fiscal year, the service maintained important modernization programs such as the RAH-66 armed reconnaissance helicopter, the Advanced Field Artillery System, and the Javelin missile system. Funding for procuring new equipment, however, was down 27 percent from FY 1991 levels, and some systems, such as the Javelin, were funded only for low-rate initial production.

The Army's medical research programs and the Corps of Engineers civil works programs continued to benefit the nation in FY 1993. Army medical research programs made advances in developing antibiotics and blood plasma proteins that may one day assist civilians injured in accidents or violent crime. Army medical researchers also investigated diseases that threatened public health and discovered a new means to fight malaria. Corps of Engineers civil works programs were instrumental in protecting lives and property during the 1993 floods, and new projects begun in FY 1993 can be expected to provide more benefits in the future.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

Since 1990 the Army has studied reducing the size and expense of its departmental headquarters. The Army completed its most recent study, the Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), Transformation Study, in January 1993. The study sought to help determine the optimal structure required for HQDA to improve the administrative management of the Department of the Army. Although the study did not include budget figures, it programmed manpower levels with a 32 percent reduction through FY 1997. The elimination of military and civilian personnel spaces, which affected numerous agencies, met congressional goals for reductions.

HQDA reviewed and evaluated all headquarters elements and all subordinate staff support agencies (SSA) and field operating agencies (FOA) for the downsizing. Planners hoped to design a smaller, more efficient headquarters that could handle anticipated economic constraints amidst increasing military challenges. HQDA also considered the use of technological advances to improve management and save resources. In accordance with these goals, HQDA established a Headquarters Director of Information Management in the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army to improve management efficiency in the Army Staff and Secretariat.

The formation of an office within the Army Staff (ARSTAF) to consolidate installation management responsibilities marked the most significant organizational change within HQDA. The Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff consolidated installation management activities because installation commanders had to answer to too many proponent offices in operating Army installations. In consolidating these activities, organizations and functions were transferred on 1 July 1993 from their original agencies to the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), a provisional organization on the Army Staff.

The Office of the ACSIM consolidated the Directorate of Management offices relating to installation management doctrine, base realignment and closure, Army Communities of Excellence, and commercial activities; Corps of Engineers (COE) offices relating to environmen-

7

tal policies and programs; U.S. Engineering and Housing Support Center functions relating to housing and facilities policy; and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel's (DCSPER) U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center. Centralizing installation responsibilities under a single ARSTAF proponent allowed the Army to streamline functions, integrate doctrine, and conserve resources during the force drawdown.

The ACSIM's responsibilities include the development, direction, and management of facilities and programs intended to stimulate continued growth and to transform Army installations into power-projection bases from which trained and ready forces can deploy to perform their military missions. The ACSIM's goal is to raise the quality of life on installations in order to boost productivity, improve retention, and increase combat readiness. Toward this end, the ACSIM's responsibilities include ensuring that all Army installations provide excellent facilities and services for soldiers, dependents, and civilian employees. Under the ACSIM's guidance Army installations are expected to develop new strategies to collaborate with local communities and private firms to mutually benefit both the public and private sectors. The ACSIM also expects to ensure that installations comply with environmental laws; prevent pollution and clean up contaminated sites; and preserve and protect natural resources. Finally, one of ACSIM's most important functions is to monitor the progress of congressionally mandated installation initiatives such as those related to base realignment and closure and the construction of chemical demilitarization facilities. The Office of the ACSIM is scheduled to become a permanent official ARSTAF agency on 1 October 1993.

In FY 1993 the Army continued downsizing and withdrawing from many installations outside the continental United States (CONUS) no longer needed due to the end of the Cold War. The number and size of Army installations in CONUS also continued to change during the fiscal year, with implementation of congressionally mandated Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) legislation. During the fiscal year the Army continued to implement BRAC Commission recommendations to close Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana; Fort Ord, California; Fort Devens, Massachusetts; Sacramento Army Depot, California; and the Harry Diamond Laboratories in Virginia. Other scheduled realignments include moving the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Polk, Louisiana, to Fort Hood, Texas; relocating the Joint Readiness Training Center from Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, to Fort Polk; and moving the Recruiting Command from Fort Sheridan, Illinois, to Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Cumulative BRAC recommendations resulted in the sale, transfer, or closure of fifty-three stand-alone family housing areas by the end of FY 1993, and operations ceased at sixteen other installations in CONUS. BRAC actions in CONUS are expected to create an estimated liability of

8

$3 billion, which will be funded by Department of Defense (DOD) appropriations taken from the Army's Total Obligation Authority (TOA) funds. The Army also returned 427 European sites and 24 Korean sites to host nations. Unlike the liabilities with CONUS realignments, these actions outside CONUS will be funded from the Operation &amp; Maintenance, Army (OMA), funds of overseas commands.

In addition to the ongoing BRAC, the Army conducted its own Total Army Basing Study in FY 1993 to evaluate space requirements and identify further surplus installations for possible closure. As a result of the study's findings, the Army announced plans to discontinue operations at one installation and realign four others. This brought the total, three-round number of CONUS BRAC closures to eighty-three and realignments to sixteen. These actions could potentially affect more than 110,000 soldiers and civilians and their families. The Army also announced plans to return another 594 overseas sites to their host nations, which would potentially affect more than 150,000 soldiers and civilians.

## Management and Information Systems

The Office of the Director of Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (ODISC4) sets policy and coordinates automation growth and compatibility for the Army. During the fiscal year ODISC4 led Army Staff and major command planning to effect transfers directed by Defense Management Report Decision (DMRD) 918. DMRD 918 provided for the establishment of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) and called for the realignment of missions and resources from the Army to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). ODISC4 also initiated planning for the transfer of information security resources from the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) to DISA. Preparations for the transfer resulted in the issuance of Department of the Army General Orders no. 19, 28 September 1993, which inactivated the 7th Signal Command and transferred the personnel and equipment of four Army Information Processing Centers (AIPC) at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; St. Louis, Missouri; Rock Island, Illinois; and Huntsville, Alabama, to DISA, scheduled to be effective 1 October 1993.

The Army leadership established an Information Mission Area Assessment Review Team (IMAART) in the third quarter of FY 1993. The team conducted assessment and assistance visits to Army major commands (MACOM) to determine the overall level of compliance with public laws and with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and HQDA Information Mission Area (IMA) policies and guidance. IMAART is scheduled to visit all MACOMs on a triennial basis, although individual organizations can request special assistance visits. IMAART is a multicommand and multiagency organization composed of representatives or subject matter experts (SME) from ODISC4, the Information Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency (ISSAA), and the Information Systems Command (ISC) and volunteer SMEs from

nonvisited MACOMs. IMAART conducted visits to U.S. Army, Europe (USAREUR), and U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) to assess their compliance in the implementation and dissemination of applicable Information Resource Management (IRM), as well as IMA and planned IMA policies and procedures. Oversight visits examined the MACOMs' programs for Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA); certification of IMA assets to meet Army and DOD automation architecture and standards; and career development in all six IMA disciplines (automation, telecommunications, publications and printing, visual information, libraries, and records management).

The Army Software Test and Evaluation Panel (STEP) mandated a required set of software metrics for all Army software developers on 4 June 1993. The STEP, which has overseen the software development process through testing and evaluation since its establishment in 1989, sets standards for Army software metrics. The STEP standards are approved by the Army leadership after coordination with the Army Acquisition Executive (AAE), the DISC4, and the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for Operations Research (DUSA-OR). Guidance for using the June 1993 mandated software metrics is contained in draft DA Pamphlet 73-1, which DUSA-OR implemented as an interim operating draft.

The Army Tactical Command and Control System (ATCCS) program was a major automation effort during the fiscal year. The ATCCS is the Army's comprehensive approach to automating its tactical command and control systems and improving its communications systems under an umbrella automation architecture. It is intended to give commanders from corps to battalion level a common picture of the battlefield and to facilitate synchronization of combat forces. Guided by the Army Command and Control Master Plan, the Army established this program to link the five major battlefield functional command and control systems for commanders and to improve interoperability among Army, joint, and allied systems. The five ATCCS subsystems are the Maneuver Control System, the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control System, the All Source Analysis System, the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System, and the Combat Service Support Control System. Plans call for linking these systems through the Army Data Distribution System (ADDS), the Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) system, and the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). ATCCS is still evolving with the integration of battlefield automated systems and with other subsystems in various stages of development, testing, and fielding. Early testing of the ATCCS architecture began in the fall of 1992 with substantial progress made in software development during 1993.

The Maneuver Control System (MCS) provides Army tactical commanders and staffs at the corps level and below with secure automated command and control capability for planning, coordinating, and controlling tactical operations. It automates the preparation, processing, and distribution of plans, orders, and reports through a network of computer devices linked by existing communications means. In FY 1993 the Army revised its expectations for developing a completed MCS Version 11 software and for fielding newer common hardware platforms. In February 1993 the Army decided to discontinue funding the current contract and to proceed with a different development strategy. This decision resulted from significant delivery delays due to contractor software development difficulties and the Army's lack of confidence in the contractor's ability to deliver Version 11 without further schedule slips and cost increases. A restructured MCS program strategy that began in March 1993 consists of three basic components: a Common ATCCS Support Software (CASS) package; a set of prototype applications software modules; and reclaimed or reusable software from MCS Version 11. These components are expected to serve as the new MCS software infrastructure building blocks. Future versions of MCS software are planned to extend automated command and control capabilities down to the battalion, company, and platoon levels and finally to infantry squads or individual crew-served weapon systems through subordinate MCS systems.

The Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAADC2) system provides an automated means of furnishing timely data to FAAD weapons in order to protect friendly aircraft and facilitate management of the air battle. The system consists of nondevelopmental computers, displays, and printers that are common throughout ATCCS and nondevelopmental ground sensors with their requisite operating software. In May 1993 the Army gave approval for FAADC2 to proceed into low-rate initial production to procure enough hardware and software to equip three light divisions and a training base. The Army also authorized production of test articles for the initial operational test and

evaluation of follow-on FAADC2 software for heavy divisions.

The All Source Analysis System (ASAS), a subsystem of the Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW) of ATCCS, supports division and corps commanders with the automated capability to receive and correlate data from strategic and tactical sensors and intelligence sources; to produce and disseminate all-source intelligence; to provide a common view of the enemy threat; and to nominate potential attack targets. Following the completion of the first block of ASAS operational testing and evaluation during the fiscal year, three ASAS systems were fielded to the 82d Airborne Division. The Army Systems Acquisition Review Council (ASARC) recommended further ASAS testing and evaluation in July 1993 to the Defense Acquisition Board. The Defense Acquisition Executive is expected to make a decision in early FY 1994 on whether the next ASAS version is to enter Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).

The development of software for the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) continued in FY 1993. AFATDS is an automated battlefield management and fire support system. It is intended to perform the five battlefield management functions of planning, execution, movement control, mission support, and fire direction operations. In October 1992 Magnavox, the Version 1 software contractor, received a contract for developing Version 2 AFATDS software. The Army completed a critical design review supporting Version 1 development in November 1992 and completed Version 1 formal qualification testing in September 1993.

The Combat Service Support Control System (CSSCS) is the control element for the CSS segment of ATCCS. The CSSCS is intended to collect and analyze logistical, medical, and personnel information and disseminate it to CSS force level and theater commanders. The Army successfully demonstrated the CSSCS at an Early User Test and Experimentation during September and October 1992. However, the Army decided at the ATCCS Operational Test Readiness Reviews held in April and June 1993 to delay the CSSCS Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) and instead conduct a Limited User Test (LUT). An Enhanced Program Stability Panel met in August 1993 to review the effects of the IOT&amp;E schedule delay on the revised program. The panel concluded that the postponement of the IOT&amp;E and the introduction of the LUT were justified. As FY 1993 ended, the CSSCS was scheduled to begin an LUT in mid-October 1993 during a command post exercise.

The Army Data Distribution System (ADDS), part of the ATCCS, is composed of two communications subsystems: the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) and the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). During FY 1993 EPLRS was in low-rate initial production to procure 1,800 user units and 20 net control stations. The Army awarded the final contract option for 515 user units in May 1993, and EPLRS successfully completed technical testing in July. The 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia, executed an interim EPLRS fielding that provided the Army with insight on the operational use of the system. Using this information, the JTIDS underwent additional engineering development and subsequently passed a follow-on reliability growth test by the end of the fiscal year.

Another component of ATCCS, the SINCGARS, is a family of vehicular and manportable radios for command and control of tactical units. Designed as a voice command and control radio, it also has limited data communications capability. During FY 1993 International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) delivered approximately 1,300 SINCGARS radios per month to the Army, and General Dynamics completed SINCGARS operational testing and received Army approval for full rate production. The Army also prepared for a competition between ITT and General Dynamics for splitting future contract awards of up to 30,000 radios per annum. In addition, the Army Electronics Proving Ground successfully completed technical testing of Electronic Counter Countermeasures (ECCM) and made co-site interference improvements to the SINCGARS radio design.

Other major automation programs under ODISC4 included the Sustaining Base Information Services (SBIS) and the

Reserve Component Automation Systems (RCAS). The SBIS program is intended to provide software and hardware to support installation and MACOM management. As envisioned, the SBIS program will eventually provide both MACOM Internal Support Modules (MISM) and Installation Support Modules (ISM) and will be fielded to approximately seventy installations according to the priority of their support to force projection and sustainment. In June 1993 the Army awarded the SBIS contract to the Federal Systems Company, a subsidiary of the IBM Corporation.

RCAS is a comprehensive computer system designed to support the decision-making needs of commanders, staffs, and functional managers responsible for leading and managing Army National Guard and Reserve units. RCAS is composed of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computers, office automation software, secure wide area network (WAN) telecommunications, specialized application software, and a fully integrated database for each of approximately 8,000 Army Guard and Reserve units throughout the United States. During the fiscal year the Army conducted an operational assessment of the current phase of RCAS development (RCAS-X). The assessment took place from 26 July to 31 August 1993 to ensure that problems identified in the RCAS limited user test had been corrected; to demonstrate and evaluate new versions of Computer Based Training; and to demonstrate that the wide area network provided adequate capacity for acceptable performance to meet current RCAS requirements. The Army installed approximately 2,400 RCAS-X terminals in more than 360 reserve component units during the fiscal year.

As the proponent for Army automation security efforts, ODISC4 saved the Army $171.6 million through cost avoidance during the fiscal year. Working with the Communications Security (COMSEC) Multiservice Working Group, chaired by the Army, ODISC4 provided intangible benefits to the Army's automated security program at no or minimal cost to the Army. These benefits included improving security for ultra high frequency radio (UHFR) communications, which significantly increased the readiness status of the National Guard and Army Reserve, and improving the interface between analog and digital data on single-channel radio nets. The Army also benefited from excess COMSEC equipment from other services that provided maximum security capability in Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) and Echelon Above Corps (EAC) Triservice Tactical (TRI-TAC) systems and provided the capability to secure all FORSCOM computer systems and information nets.

During the fiscal year the Army decreased funding for personnel information systems. The service also reduced spending for these programs by nearly a third for FY 1994 to FY 1999, jeopardizing modernization efforts that would significantly benefit the Army's overall personnel management system.

Nevertheless, two automated systems made significant progress during the fiscal year: the Personnel Electronic Records Management System (PERMS), which received Army and DOD approval from the Major Automated Information Systems Review Council (MAISRC) for full-scale development and fielding; and the Personnel Readiness Information System (PRISM), which was developed by Forces Command's Adjutant General's Office. PERMS digitally converts and stores paper personnel records. Personnel records scheduled for conversion are kept at the United States Total Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM); the Enlisted Records Center (EREC), a field operating agency under PERSCOM; the Army Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN); and the National Guard Bureau (NGB). ARPERCEN tested and accepted PERMS during the fiscal year and also began conversion work at the EREC and the NGB. PERSCOM is scheduled to begin testing PERMS in FY 1994. PRISM allows major commands to rapidly manipulate information on personnel authorization and skills and to cut time spent on personnel management. PRISM takes existing information and uses a relational database to create fast and accurate strength summaries by grade, specialty code, or military occupational specialty (MOS).

During the fiscal year all Army components agreed to adopt a Total Army Functional Unity and Total Army Personnel Operations Integration (TAPOI) strategy for information management to fully integrate personnel operations of the various components. The major systems and efforts under TAPOI include the Total Army Personnel Data Base (TAPDB); the Inter-Component Data Transfer (ICDT) project; enhancement and modernization of the Mobilization Personnel Processing System (MOBPERS); and the publication of the Manning the Force Automation Architecture (MTFAA) Guide to the Army Personnel Information Systems, also known as the Softbook. The TAPDB is a collection

of data- bases used by the civilian, active, and reserve components that contains and arrays the common data from each component. Standardization of total Army personnel operations will continue to improve with the development of ICDT, which is expected to allow for the quick and nearly seamless transfer of personnel information between components.

Army personnel operations continued to move toward joint integration in FY 1993. Under the direction of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), which directs joint initiatives for all the services, the Army adopted the new Uniformed Services Identification Card. The new card provides more useful information at less cost than the old card. Progress was also made in the Military Entrance Processing Command's (MEPCOM) Integrated Resource System (MIRS) program, the Army's portion of an intended Joint Recruiting Information Support System (JRISS). MIRS was approved for development and fielding and will replace aging UNISYS 80 equipment that has become difficult to maintain. MIRS is expected to greatly increase the efficiency of the Military Entrance Processing Stations as they provide entrance data. Also, the United States Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) began developmental studies for Recruiting 2000 (R2K), an automation system to support its recruiting activities. R2K is expected to give recruiters access to valuable information for improving their presentation and to streamline the administration of recruiting activities.

Technological advances allowed the CSA's Monthly Readiness Review (MRR) to include unit readiness projections in FY 1993. For the first time, the Army's senior leadership used two automated management systems-the Army Readiness Management System (ARMS), which integrated existing ARSTAF logistics and personnel databases, and the executive version of the Status Projection System (SPS), which provided multiscreen projections of unit status and readiness forecasts-to help make resource decisions. The Army expects these technologies to allow for better management of readiness resources as the systems mature and become more efficient.

The Army Mobilization Operations Planning and Execution System (AMOPES) is HQDA's source for issuing policies, planning guidance, and assumptions for all mobilizations and for Army operations conducted without an involuntary call-up of reserve component forces. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (ODCSOPS), which is responsible for revising the AMOPES to reflect current strategies and concerns, continued incorporating lessons learned from the Persian Gulf War and Army exercises conducted during the fiscal year. AMOPES revisions are expected to be completed during FY 1994, with another revision scheduled for FY 1996.

## Economies and Efficiencies

During the fiscal year the U.S. Army Audit Agency (AAA) continued to pursue an aggressive program that included audit service and achievement of Total Quality Management (TQM) objectives. For example, the Auditor General established a Quality Council to better support AAA TQM efforts. The Quality Council established Quality Initiative Papers to disseminate information on the agency's quality initiatives to all agency personnel. Under TQM, the AAA reformed its business practices to better serve its clients. The AAA conducted a survey to determine if it was meeting clients' needs and expectations and used the survey to find new and improved ways to serve client organizations.

During FY 1993 the AAA Policy and Programs Division, which plans and manages the agency's audit program, developed an implementation plan to take over audit follow-up and compliance functions from The Inspector General. The division issued regulations to improve policies and procedures for conducting audits and reporting audit results and worked with DOD to improve other audit policies and procedures. The division also spearheaded AAA efforts in adopting computer-assisted audit techniques as part of Project DANIEL-an initiative to share information among DOD auditors.

## Chapter 2 - 1993 DAHSUM

The AAA programmed 169 audits for FY 1993, including ongoing projects from the previous fiscal year. By the end of FY 1993 the AAA issued 334 reports, including formal audit reports, consulting reports, memorandum reports, and advisory reports. The audits resulted in potential monetary benefits to the Army of $3.9 billion. Audits on the "Development of Army Requirements," "Air-to-Ground Missile Systems," "Depot-Level Repairs Performed in the Field," and "Organizational Structure of U.S. Army Reserve Training Divisions," each representing from $130 million to $1.8 billion in potential monetary benefits, accounted for more than three-fourths of the $3.9 billion total in potential monetary benefits.

In the Development of Army Requirements audit, the AAA found that the Army's process for developing future requirements needed improvement to ensure force structure, materiel, and mobilization requirements were balanced and integrated. For example, planned acquisitions of improved tank rounds in the Army's fiscal year 1994-99 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), coupled with on-hand quantities of older models, put the Army significantly over the acquisition objective. Selling the excess tank rounds could generate $1.8 billion in proceeds that could be returned to the Army's ammunition procurement account. The auditors recommended that all requirements determination studies contain explicit assumptions that are both credible and compatible; that the Army pro- vide justification and approval for deviation from these scenarios; and that an evaluation be made of the Total Army Analysis process to determine whether it can be streamlined and made more responsive. Finally, the AAA recommended a reevaluation of procurement quantities for the improved tank rounds. The auditors believed such a reevaluation would prompt a decrease in procurement funds due to a reduction in quantities and advised development of a plan to sell excess rounds. DA agreed with the recommendations or proposed alternative corrective actions and concurred with the potential monetary benefit of $1.8 billion. DA recognized, however, that if future fiscal and political events restricted the number of older tank rounds the Army could sell, the full potential monetary benefits might not be realized.

The AAA found in the Air-to-Ground Missile Systems audit that the Army's inventory of Hellfire missiles, including scheduled deliveries and approved purchases, exceeded the authorized Hellfire acquisition objective. In addition, guided missile and large rocket status reports did not accurately reflect the missile inventory balances. As a result, the Integrated Materiel Management Center was buying Hellfire launcher rails that were no longer needed. The auditors recommended that the Army declare certain models of missiles as excess and identify them to the Defense Security Agency for foreign military sales and cancel remaining deliveries of these missiles; establish a standard reconciliation form and ensure item managers use the form during their quarterly reconciliations; and cancel outstanding deliveries for launcher rails. The Army agreed with most of AAA's recommendations or proposed alternative corrective actions that resulted in reducing the estimate of monetary benefits from $858 million to $853.2 million.

The AAA found in the Depot-Level Repairs Performed in the Field audit that the Army failed to take advantage of savings from depot-level repairs performed in the field and to adjust the programmed resource requirements for troop maintenance. Commodity commands did not reduce inventory and depot maintenance requirements to account for the decreased demand and fewer unserviceable returns that occur when field activities do depot-level repairs. Field activities usually obtained authorization to perform depot-level repairs, but the Army did not adequately track these repairs or their costs. Army maintenance policies and procedures were inadequate as they related to depot-level repairs performed in the field.

The auditors recommended revising procedures for adjusting resource requirements in troop maintenance budgets to reflect cost reductions from significant initiatives and approved specialized field repair activities. Another recommendation called for the Aviation and Tank-Automotive Commands to reduce wholesale inventory and depot maintenance work- load requirements for fiscal years 1993-98 to reflect the decreased demands based on implementation of field repair

activities. The DA agreed with the recommendations, and the commands took corrective actions that resulted in monetary benefits of $272.7 million.

In the Organizational Structure of U.S. Army Reserve Training Divisions audit, the AAA determined that Army Reserve training divisions included positions that were not needed for mobilization and that other less expensive alternatives were available for peacetime support requirements. Opportunities existed to reduce peacetime strength by 3,930 personnel (primarily headquarters personnel, band members, and cooks) over the six years of the fiscal year 1994-99 POM, and by abolishing these positions the Army anticipated saving $150.3 million. The auditors recommended that the Army eliminate the authorizations for cooks from Army Reserve training divisions and use alternative methods to feed division soldiers in peacetime. The auditors also recommended deleting the headquarters of four training divisions from the Army Reserve force structure and then assigning their subordinate units to Army Reserve commands (or find other alternatives for peacetime support) and deleting the twelve training division bands from the Army Reserve force structure. The Army agreed with all the recommendations or proposed alternative corrective actions except for the AAA's recommendation concerning training division bands, which decreased the potential monetary benefits from $150.3 million to $133.2 million.

The AAA also issued advisory reports for the benefit of managers throughout the Army in FY 1993. These reports were widely distributed to illustrate common problems identified during audits and to suggest actions to correct similar problems that might exist at other Army activities. One advisory report on the management of finance and accounting operations, for example, described common problem areas found in eighteen audits of finance and accounting offices or activities. Common problems included unliquidated obligations, cash management, and vendor payments. The AAA report summarized these problems and provided checklists to help managers identify similar problems in their own organizations.

## Budget

Congress granted the Army slightly less than $63.9 billion in new budget authority for FY 1993. While this figure was more than the $63.5 billion in the President's budget request, OMA funding took a cut of more than $745 million, and military construction nearly another $585 million. The RDTE (Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation) budget added $618 million, and dedicated equipment for the Army Reserve and

National Guard gained nearly $617 million. Fiscal year 1993 obligations and outlays are provided in Table 1.

The development of the FY 1994 budget was a major HQDA task in FY 1993. The Army submitted the FY 1994 President's Budget request on 8 April 1993. In the budget proposal the Army had a 23.8 percent share of the Department

of Defense's Total Obligation Authority (TOA)-a decrease from 24 percent in FY 1993 and from 26.1 percent in FY 1992. The Army requested $60.7 billion in TOA for FY 1994, representing a6 percent decline in real terms from the previous fiscal year, not including supplemental funding. From FY 1989 through FY 1993, the Army realized approximately a 30 percent dollar reduction by cutting virtually all areas of the budget, but most notably force structure, modernization, and base support. Table 2 shows funding trends in Army appropriations from FY 1992 and FY 1993 (in current dollars).

*Figures may not add up exactly due to rounding.

In developing the FY 1994 budget, the Army planned for continued downsizing in fiscal resources as well as in both military and civilian personnel. The budget request for military personnel provided funding to continue the Voluntary

## Chapter 2 - 1993 DAHSUM

Separation Incentive and the Special Separation Benefit programs that had been introduced in FY 1992. It also expanded the Army's voluntary separation tools by adding an early retirement program for military personnel. The budget request reduced Army active component strength to 540,000 by the end of the fiscal year, a 35,000 soldier decline from the revised FY 1993 active duty end strength. The budget request also provided funds for twelve Regular Army divisions by the end of FY 1994, a reduction of two divisions from the FY 1993 force structure. The request budgeted the reserve components for reduction and realignment to meet future force requirements. The Army National Guard's FY 1994 end strength was set at 410,000 and the Army Reserve's was set at 260,000. The budget request also reduced the 1993 civilian end strength by 18,013, for a total of 308,270 by the end of 1994.

The Operation and Maintenance budget request for FY 1994 maintained the Army's readiness objectives by funding enhanced training activities such as the Combat Training Centers. The request supported air and

20

ground operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of 800 miles per year for major combat systems and 14.5 flying hours per air crew per month for the active force. The budget request also fully funded efforts to meet all known statutory and regulatory environmental requirements.

The FY 1994 budget request reflected HQDA's commitment to continue force modernization as well as research and development. The request funded upgrades for the Abrams tank and Bradley fighting vehicle; funded the Army's initiative to digitize the battlefield; funded the Hellfire II missile, a third generation airborne antitank weapon; funded continued production of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) launcher; provided funding for an initial low production rate for the Javelin Missile System; and funded a third year of the multiyear UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter procurement. Ammunition funding was set at $743.4 million and Conventional Ammunition Demilitarization at $53 million. The Army's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget request continued development of the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS) and the Future Ammunition Resupply Vehicle (FARV). The Army also requested funding for other modernization programs such as the Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Longbow Hellfire, Javelin, and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) antitank missile systems. The FY 1994 presidential budget request is shown in Table 3.

## Personnel

The post-Cold War reductions in Army strength continued into fiscal year 1993. Personnel reductions during the previous fiscal year seriously affected the Army as it refashioned for new missions amidst fast-paced changes in the global geopolitical environment. The 1992 strength cuts created turbulence throughout the Army as personnel managers struggled to fill critical officer and enlisted specialties and maintain unit readiness. Active Army strength, approximately 610,000 at the start of FY 1993, declined to 572,423 by the end of the year, the Army's lowest active end strength since FY 1948. The end strength total consisted of 87,845 officers, 480,379 enlisted personnel, and 4,199 cadets.

As the active Army's aggregate strength dropped by nearly 38,000 soldiers in FY 1993, there were 107,627 enlisted separations and 14,967 officer departures during the fiscal year. The turnover of trained soldiers presented personnel managers and unit leaders with difficulties in keeping the Army at high readiness levels. As the Army cut personnel through normal attrition, separation incentives, and reductions in force (RIF), the service had to manage these decreases so as to retain soldiers with critical skills and experience.

In FY 1993 the active and reserve components of the Army included 1,258,242 military personnel and 294,217 civilians. Table 4 shows the Army's total strength at the end of the fiscal year.

## Enlisted Personnel

The Army set an objective of enlisting 76,900 soldiers for FY 1993.

The U.S. Army Recruiting Command met the Army's goal for the fiscal year by accessing 77,563 active component soldiers (100.9 percent of the recruiting objective). There were 70,380 non-prior-service recruit accessions and 7,183 prior military service accessions. Among the non-prior-service recruits, 94.5 percent were high school diploma graduates, a decline from 100 percent in FY 1992, and 4.7 percent had earned GEDs (general equivalency diplomas). The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test ranked 70.1 percent of the 1993 recruits as high-quality accessions, with scores in Test Score Categories (TSC) I through IIIA; 2.2 percent scored in TSC IV, the lowest category. Of the Army's accessions for the fiscal year, 36,767 (52.2 percent) non-prior-service recruits enlisted for fouryear terms, 29,798 (42.3 percent) enlisted for three-year terms, and 3,815 (5.4 percent) enlisted for two-year terms. Table 5 shows trends in test score categories for non-prior-service accessions for FY 1992 and FY 1993.

One Army official described recruiting during the fiscal year as particularly challenging because potential recruits seemed less inclined to pursue a job in the service. A USAREC 1993 Youth Attitude Tracking Study (YATS) revealed the continuation of a steady decline of enlistment by prospective recruits. The prime market for Army recruiters continued to be 17- to 21-year-old males, but the propensity for this group to join the Army fell more than 37 percent from FY 1990 to FY 1993. The post-Cold War political climate raised many questions about the relevance of the Army in the 1990s, while widely publicized reductions in the Army's strength caused many potential recruits to have doubts about a career in the service.

24

The Army spent $518.9 million on active component recruiting in FY 1993 compared to $543.1 million in FY 1992. The Army's $30.9 million advertising budget for FY 1993 represented a $6 million cut from the previous fiscal year.

During the fiscal year USAREC reduced the number of recruiting stations from 1,487 to 1,446 and the total number of recruiters from 4,626 to 4,338. The recruiting battalions based in Albuquerque and Milwaukee ended their recruiting missions on 30 September 1993, with plans to close completely in early FY 1994. In addition, USAREC completed its relocation to Fort Knox, Kentucky, in FY 1993, a move begun in FY 1992 in response to the BRAC closure of Fort Sheridan, Illinois.

In FY 1993 the Army met its annual retention projections, reenlisting 75,000 soldiers. MACOMs operated their own retention programs and set individual objectives for initial and mid-career reenlistments. The total Army retention rate among soldiers eligible for initial reenlistment was 46.1 percent, and 76.5 percent for mid-career reenlistments. Table 6 shows retention objectives for selected MACOMs in FY 1993.

In any given year the Army experiences much turnover through normal attrition-retirements, expired enlistments, and discharges for discipline and inadequate weight control. In FY 1993, 107,627 enlisted soldiers separated from active duty through normal attrition, compared to 168,536 in FY 1992.

As the Army's total authorized strength continued to decline during the fiscal year, the size of force structure cuts did not keep up with manpower cuts. Force structure determines the number of units and authorized positions available for soldiers to fill. When force structure reductions trailed the decline in manpower strength, a negative operating strength deviation (OSD) resulted between force structure allowance and actual operating strength. Strength deviation is an important statistical measurement for personnel managers because it gauges the difference between actual strength (number of soldiers on hand) and authorized strength (number of soldiers the Army is allotted). The OSD for the year averaged approximately -13,500 and varied from a maximum of -24,900 in August 1993 to -5,000 at the end of September.

The large negative operating strength deviation reflected shortages in select military occupational specialties (MOS), especially infantry, signal, aviation maintenance, and field artillery. Throughout the fiscal year the Army contended with shortages in MOs 11M (Fighting Vehicle Mechanized Infantryman), as the strength level for this position fell to 92 percent of total authorizations and 85 percent in authorized Skill Level 1 (SL1) soldiers (those in the lowest enlisted ranks). Serious signal MOs short falls included MOs 31D (Mobile Subscriber Equipment Transmission System Operator), at 89 percent of total authorizations and 83 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; and MOs 31L (Wire System Installer-Maintainer), at 85 percent of total authorizations and 72 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers. Critical aviation MOs shortages included MOs 67R (AH-64 Attack Helicopter Repairer), at 88 percent of total authorizations and 79 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; MOs 67U (CH-47 Helicopter Repairer), at 87 percent of total authorizations and 69 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; MOs 68B (Aircraft Powerplant Repairer), at 86 percent of total authorizations and 75 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; MOs 68F (Aircraft Electrician), at 81 percent of total authorizations and 70 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; MOs 68G (Aircraft Structure Repairer), at 83 percent of total authorizations and 73 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers; and MOs 68H (Aircraft Pneudraulics Repairer), at 81 percent of total authorizations and 70 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers. The most pressing MOs field artillery shortage was in MOs 27M (Multiple Launch Rocket System Repairer), which was at 71 percent of authorized strength and 75 percent in authorized SL1 soldiers. PERSCOM and USAREC expect to remedy or minimize these acute shortages during the next fiscal year.

To comply with the congressional intent to downsize the Army through voluntary separations, the service offered several programs during the fiscal year to encourage departures. The Voluntary Early Transition (VET) program was offered to soldiers with at least three years of service in selected skill areas. Under this limited program, 440 soldiers separated during the year. The Army offered Voluntary Separation Incentives (VSI) and Special Separation Benefits (SSB) to enlisted personnel with more than six years but less than twenty years of service. Soldiers in the following categories were eligible: a promotable specialist or lower

grade with more than six years of service as of 5 December 1991 who was ineligible to reenlist due to Retention Control Points (RCP) provisions; promotable sergeants and sergeants with twelve or more years of service who were ineligible to reenlist due to RCP provisions; sergeants and higher grades with at least nine years of service in a balanced or overstrength MOs; and any soldier with at least six years of service denied retention by HQDA. During the fiscal year 3,469 soldiers separated under the VSI and SSB programs.

The FY 1993 National Defense Authorization Act permitted early retirement for soldiers with as few as fifteen years of service. In April 1993 the Office of the Secretary of Defense approved the Army's concept plan to implement early retirements. The Army designed an early retirement pilot program and used it to develop propensity rates. The program demonstrated its usefulness as a tool to help balance the force during a drawdown, as approximately 1,300 noncommissioned officers (NCO) in selected overstrength MOSs and grades were offered the chance to apply for early retirement, and 241 of these soldiers eventually elected to retire. The Army canceled a programmed reduction in force for the fiscal year when sufficient voluntary separations met the required reductions.

## Officer Personnel

The Army used voluntary and involuntary programs to reduce officer end strength in FY 1993, for the second consecutive year. Total officer losses for the fiscal year were 14,967. Officer and warrant officer corps end strength was reduced by 8,055 to 87,845 in FY 1993. Table 7 shows FY 1993 end strength and grade distribution.

The active Army accessioned 6,870 officers during the fiscal year, of which 5,474 were commissioned officers and 1,396 warrant officers. Officers received their commissions through the United States Military Academy (USMA), the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), the Officer Candidate School (OCS), or direct appointment. The USMA commissioned 1,019 officers in FY 1993, or 19 percent of the year's total commissions. The majority (999) of the USMA's new officers were commissioned into the sixteen basic branches, and twenty were commissioned into the Medical Service Corps. A total of 1,331 officers were commissioned by direct appointment in FY 1993, with most of these (1,222) commissioned directly into medical branches and the Chaplain and Judge Advocate General's Corps. OCS commissioned 363 Regular Army officers in the basic branches. Warrant officers were appointed through the Warrant Officer Procurement Program. Following completion of the Warrant Officer Leader Development Course, the Army appointed 1,396 warrant officers to a variety of technical and aviation career fields.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps remained the U.S. Army's largest producer of commissioned officers. ROTC yielded 50 percent of officers commissioned into the Regular Army during the fiscal year. Senior ROTC was available at 349 colleges and universities across the United States, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia. ROTC enrollment during the fiscal year was 30,965, of which 9,931 were enrolled in the Advanced Program (junior and senior academic years), and more than 8,000 students were on ROTC scholarships. During FY 1993 ROTC graduated and commissioned a total of 4,661 officers, which included 2,761 active component, 1,690 reserve component, and 210 who were granted deferments to pursue advanced education. Of those commissioned into the Regular Army, 2,375 were commissioned into the basic branches and 386 into special branches.

Despite the infusion of new officers, the Army experienced a shortage of approximately 1,900 branch-qualified captains in FY 1993. Projections indicated this figure could increase to 3,500 by FY 1995 if remedial steps were not taken. The drawdown and the departure of branch-qualified captains under the Voluntary Separations Incentive Program (VSIP) created the shortage. The increased demand for branch-qualified captains in the Acquisition Corps, congressionally mandated support to reserve components, and the requirements for captains to staff positions in ROTC and the USMA contributed to the shortfall. PERSCOM recommended alleviating the shortage through the use of active guard and reserve captains to fill branch-qualified jobs. PERSCOM also recommended civilianizing branch-qualified positions, reducing the number of ROTC schools, and civilianizing the USMA faculty.

Although the Army disapproved PERSCOM's suggestions, the CSA approved several measures in late September 1993 to reduce the shortage of captains. These included decreasing the time in service for promotion to captain from four and a half to four years, with implementation completed with the exhaustion of the FY 1994 captains promotion list. The CSA maintained the length for company command tours at eighteen months, with only select company commands-such as division and brigade headquarters and headquarters companies and long-range surveillance -considered "second" commands. The total time of command for the first and second companies, however, would be only two years. The CSA also approved the direct assignment of some captains to two-year positions in Recruiting Command and Cadet Command immediately upon their graduation from the Officer Advanced Course (non-branch-qualified). These officers would be guaranteed MTOE (modified table of organization and equipment) assignments in branch-qualifying positions, specified on their PCS (permanent change of station) orders, after completing the two-year assignment.

The Army employed voluntary and involuntary programs to reduce officer corps end strength, but the service's policy made involuntary separations the last resort. Officers considered for involuntary separation under the RIF program could choose to participate in one of the VSI and SSB programs. The RIF process and the VSI and SSB programs were used collectively to meet the end strength requirements for a given grade. Although an FY 1993 RIF Board selected captains in year groups 1983 and 1984 for involuntary separations, the Secretary of the Army disapproved a captains RIF after the VSI and SSB programs yielded sufficient volunteers for early separation.

## Civilian Work Force

The decline in the Army's military force structure in FY 1993 affected its civilian strength. With fewer units in the field, the Army required less civilian support, and during the fiscal year total civilian strength fell by 41,585. By the end of the fiscal year the Army employed 294,217 civilians, or 18.2 percent of the Total Army, the lowest percentage since 1974. Of this total, 249,771 personnel were U.S. Citizens and 44,446 were local foreign nationals. Table 8 shows DA civilians in selected commands during FY 1993.

## TABLE 8-DA CIVILIANS IN SELECTED COMMANDS* DURING FY 1993

*See glossary for acronym names.

Since 1989 (when civilian strength was 402,927, or 19.9 percent of the Total Army's 2,020,407 personnel), most civilian employee reductions have resulted from normal attrition, such as voluntary retirement or transfer, but a growing number of cuts resulted from reductions in force. Congressionally approved incentives, such as civilian separation pay, facilitated reductions and voluntary separations. The number of RIF separations reached 849 in FY 1993, up from 631 during the previous fiscal year. Of those taking separation pay, 93 percent were forty or older, 62 percent were males, and 79 percent were nonminorities.

At the end of the fiscal year the Army employed 17,008 direct-hire U.S. Citizens overseas as DA civilian personnel. Most of them were employed in three countries: more than 11,000 civilians worked in Germany, more than 1,450 in South Korea, and almost 1,300 in Panama.

More than 331 civilians served in Senior Executive Service (SES) Army leadership positions during the fiscal year. The top four organizations in SES strength were the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) with 126, the Office of the Secretary of the Army with 61, the Corps of Engineers with 49, and the Army Staff with 42 positions.

30

Women represented 40.6 percent and minorities 25.4 percent of the Army's civilian employees, slightly below the government-wide percentages of 44 percent for women and 28.1 percent for minorities. The average age of the Army's civilian work force was forty-five; 29 percent of the work force was age fifty or older; 7.7 percent were eligible for optional retirement; and 12.7 percent were eligible for early retirement under the incentives programs. Also, 30.9 percent of the work force held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 8.4 percent were retired military personnel.

Civilian performance ratings continued to climb in FY 1993, with more employees rated as fully successful. Improprieties by civilian employees resulted in the mandatory removal of 1,027, and another 444 resigned while removal actions were pending. There were 2,456 cases of lesser disciplinary actions such as written reprimands and suspensions. Formal discrimination complaints based on sexual harassment rose by a third during the fiscal year, but the

number of disciplinary actions against offending employees was unavailable because there was no reporting requirement. Army leaders plan to institute a reporting requirement in FY 1994 to track disciplinary actions for sexual harassment.

The Army invested $130,196,398 (including tuition, travel, and per diem) in civilian training expenses during the fiscal year. In addition, 119,168 employees attended 241,125 training events in FY 1993.

## Special Topics

Females comprised 12.5 percent (71,319 soldiers) of the active Army, 7.7 percent (31,386) of the Army National Guard, and 21 percent (52,416) of the total Army Reserve strength in FY 1993. Active component females comprised 14.2 percent of commissioned officers, 3.8 percent of warrant officers, and 12.4 percent of enlisted personnel.

The Army's downsizing is not expected to impede female accessions into the service or progression within ranks and assignments. During the fiscal year 11,599 non-prior-service females (102.4 percent of the recruiting objective) entered the active component. HQDA anticipates the number and percentage of women in the Army will continue to increase in FY 1994.

Army policy excludes women from assignment to battalion- and smaller-size units whose mission is to engage in direct combat (such as infantry, armor, cannon artillery, short-range air defense artillery, and combat engineers) and those units or positions that require continuous physical location with direct combat units. The details of the Army's assignment policy are contained in Army Regulation (AR) 600-13, Army Policy for the Assignment of Female Soldiers . The Army's Direct Combat Position Coding (DCPC) System classifies all positions according to the probability of direct combat and is an essential tool for implementing the Army's assignment policy. Female soldiers assigned to positions coded as "open" deploy with their units to perform their assigned mission and are subject to the same utilization policies as male soldiers. Ninety-one percent of all Army career fields and 62 percent of Army positions were open to women in FY 1993. Women are authorized in 86 percent of the enlisted military occupational specialties, 94 percent of the warrant officer specialties, and 96 percent of the officer specialties.

On 28 April 1993 Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Les Aspin directed the services to open more specialties and assignment opportunities to women. Aspin specifically wanted women to compete for combat aviation assignments, and he also directed the Army and Marine Corps to study the possibility of creating opportunities for women to serve in previously closed assignments, including field and air defense artillery, among other positions. The SECDEF established an Implementation Committee to ensure that the policies were applied consistently among the military services. The committee was also charged with reviewing and making recommendations on parental and family policies, pregnancy and deployment policies, and the appropriateness of DOD's female endangerment policies, also known as the DOD Risk Rule.

In response to the SECDEF's policy, the Army opened new positions for women in attack and scout helicopter aviation units, making more than 9,000 new positions available for females during the fiscal year. The first Army woman began training for her new aviation assignment on 4 May 1993. Some air cavalry units and Special Operations Forces aircraft, however, remained closed to women because these organizations are assigned to ground combat units and serve with combat elements during deployments.

There are currently no statutory restrictions on the utilization of women in combat, and the Army's policy on the assignment of women incorporated DOD guidance that limits high casualty risks but does not prevent women from being exposed to combat or becoming casualties. After combat aviation assignments were opened to women, risk was no longer a factor, and the Implementation Committee is developing a new assignment rule to replace the DOD Risk Rule. The Army plans to evaluate the opening of other positions to women after a new risk rule is developed.

After a total end strength decline of 38,000 during the fiscal year, minority representation remained relatively

unchanged from the previous year. Minorities still represented almost 28 percent of the active component. In FY 1993 the active force consisted of 62.3 percent Caucasians; 27.6 percent African-Americans; 4.9 percent Hispanics; and 5.2 percent Asian-Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and others. The percentage of African-Americans, the largest minority group, declined from the previ- ous year. Non-prior-service African-American accessions during FY 1993 totaled 14,410, or 20.5 percent of new active component recruits. Table 9 shows the percentage of active component minority representation in FY 1993.

The Army actively recruited women and minorities for some specialty fields. The Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAGC), for example, seeks to acquire as many qualified minority and female attorneys as possible and recruits practicing attorneys and law students graduating from schools accredited by the American Bar Association. The JAGC is authorized to grant direct appointments to qualified candidates approved by the JAGC accession board. In FY 1993 the JAGC received 990 applications, a 33 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, and selected 174 applicants. Of the selectees, 36 percent were women, the highest ratio for women selected to date. Also, of the total selectees, 14 percent were minorities. The previous five-year averages for women and minorities were 25 percent and 13 percent, respectively.

The Army's efforts to institutionalize equal opportunity (EO) programs continued during the fiscal year. In October 1992 the Army distributed revised training support packages for EO and the prevention of sexual harassment to all professional military schools. The Soldier Support Center's Equal Opportunity Proponency Office continued work on new training materials: Training Circular 26-6, Commander's Equal Opportunity Handbook; Department of the Army Pamphlet 350-20, Unit Equal Opportunity Training Guide; and a series of video tapes on sexual harassment. AR 60020, Army Command Policy , 30 March 1988, which sets forth the Army's Equal Opportunity Program, was formally staffed for its fourth change in FY 1993. Interim change four mandated EO training, including the prevention of sexual harassment, through all phases of professional military education and twice annually in units. The change also restructured the EO complaint system and introduced an Army-wide EO complaint form, as well as a unit EO complaint reporting form. The effective implementation date for the change was 17 September 1993.

Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera dispatched eleven human resource consultants to conduct independent investigations of the EO environment at various installations throughout CONUS during July and August 1993. These trips were part of the Secretary's ongoing investigations into allegations made by the Chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in August 1991. Former Secretaries had previously sent consultants to Europe in late 1991 and to CONUS posts in 1992. The visits focused on the commands' complaint processing procedures, leader involvement in the implementation of EO program initiatives, training, and an assessment of the general health of the EO climate at the

installation. The Army used these reports to help revise elements of its EO policy released in FY 1993.

Staffing the Army's EO program remained a high priority for the senior Army leadership in FY 1993. Equal opportunity representatives at battalion and company level and equal opportunity advisers (EOA) at brigade level and above continued to assist unit leaders in managing EO programs during the fiscal year. Throughout the Army, both officers and NCOs served as advisers to and supported unit leaders in meeting EO objectives and provided resources to develop appropriate programs. In June the CSA approved a recommendation to reinstate officer EOA positions on corps and division Tables of Organization and Equipment.

During the fiscal year there were 223 requests for assistance concerning complaints of racial and ethnic discrimination filed through the Inspector General. There were also 720 complaints filed through EOA channels.

On 29 January 1993, President William J. Clinton directed the Secretary of Defense to review DOD policy on homosexuals and to prepare a draft Executive Order outlining a new policy by 15 July 1993. Under existing policy (DOD Directive 1332.14), DOD banned homosexuals from military service in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which defined homosexual activity as illegal. DOD issued interim guidance on 3 February 1993 that required all cases against homosexuals then under review to remain in the processing system. The guidance also stated that armed forces recruiters would no longer ask applicants about their sexual orientation.

A well-publicized violation of DOD's interim homosexual policy, involving Army Sgt. Jose M. Zuniga, received widespread media coverage in FY 1993. On 29 April Army officials at the Presidio of San Francisco began proceedings to discharge Sergeant Zuniga after he disclosed his homosexuality on 24 April, just before the start of a large gay rights rally in Washington, D.C. Sergeant Zuniga's case attracted a great deal of atten-

34

tion because of his accomplishments in the military. He was a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, had been decorated four times during his service of more than three years, and was the 1992 Sixth Army Soldier of the Year. A few weeks later the Army recommended Zuniga for an honorable discharge, but with demotion to the rank of specialist, fourth class, on the grounds that during his 24 April pronouncement he wore a fifth medal for which he had been recommended but not approved, thus misrepresenting himself and the Army. Zuniga denied the Army's allegations concerning the medal and said that the award had been approved, but the Army continued with its discharge proceedings.

The Secretary of Defense issued a new homosexual policy for the armed forces on 19 July. The policy recognized that homosexuals had served in the armed services with distinction and stated that homosexual orientation should not be a bar to entering or remaining in military service unless an individual revealed or displayed homosexual conduct. The Secretary of Defense directed DOD to adopt the following rules and guidelines on homosexuality:

-Service members will be separated for homosexual conduct. -Applicants for military services will not be asked or required to reveal their sexual orientation, and questions regarding sexual orientation will be removed from induction applications and from ROTC and USMA applications and will not be used during entrance interviews. Applicants will also be informed of the separation policy and agree to abide by the DOD policy.

-All new recruits will receive military justice briefings upon entering the service and periodically thereafter. Briefings will include a detailed explanation of the laws and regulations governing sexual conduct by members of the armed services.

DOD defined homosexual conduct that warranted separation. A homosexual act included bodily contact, actively or passively permitted, between members of the same gender for the purpose of satisfying sexual desire. Inappropriate conduct also included statements that demonstrated a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts or homosexual marriage or attempted marriage. The new guidelines also stated that commanders and investigating agencies would not initiate inquiries solely to determine a member's sexual orientation. Authority to investigate homosexual conduct would be limited to commanders, who could initiate an investigation only when evidence clearly indicated that a cause for

disciplinary action or discharge existed. Under the new guidelines a statement by a service member indicating that he or she was homosexual or bisexual would create a rebuttable presumption that the service member was engaging or intended to engage in homosexual activity. Accused individ- uals had the opportunity to present evidence that they did not intend to commit homosexual acts. The appropriate separation authority would assess the evidence before reaching a decision. Although President Clinton set 1 October 1993 as the implementation date for the new guidelines, in September 1993 the 9th U.S. District Court ruled the DOD homosexual policy unconstitutional. On the last day of the fiscal year, the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) authorized the services an extension of the interim policy to 1 October while DOD appealed the court's decision.

The Army's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program (ADAPCP) continued to help reduce demand in FY 1993, as both positive drug tests and drug-related separations from the service declined dramatically. During the fiscal year the Army continued to focus on testing as an effective deterrent to drug use. This effort was based on guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and DOD that required the Army to expand the number of persons examined in its pool of positions designated for testing. Positions added to the pool included motor vehicle drivers who regularly transported passengers, railroad personnel, aviation personnel, personnel with access to weapons, personnel in positions that required access to top secret or sensitive compartmented information, and personnel required to participate in special access programs.

During the fiscal year 1,105,339 military personnel were subjected to random testing, a rate of 1.34 tests per soldier, with 1.01 percent testing positive. The Army also applied random testing to approximately 30,000 civilian personnel. The Army treated more than 15,000 soldiers for alcohol and drug abuse in FY 1993 by providing education and counseling services and inpatient treatment, as appropriate.

The FY 1993 National Defense Authorization Act required DOD to conduct outreach programs to reduce the demand for illegal drugs. The act's intent is to expand the military's role in reducing the national demand among young people. In response, the CSA directed the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs to develop an information base concerning the Total Army's contribution to the welfare, health, and productivity of the nation. The DOD Coordinator for Drug Enforcement Policy and Support asked the Army to submit proposals to cut usage and to direct its efforts at America's youth in general and inner-city youth in particular. DOD selected three Army programs for inclusion in the military's pilot outreach initiative. Fort Sam Houston, Texas, established the "La Salida-The Way Out" program as a basictraining-style experience that targets elementary and middle school youngsters at risk for drug usage. At Fort Meade, Maryland, the "Adopt a School Program" has units volunteering to improve local school facilities and to build relationships with students and schools near the post. The "Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program

Drug Demand Reduction Initiative" at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is a multidisciplinary prevention and education program that stresses cooperation between community agencies to prevent drug abuse. Evaluation of the three pilot programs is expected to be completed in October 1994 and to be followed by a DOD report to Congress on their effectiveness.

In FY 1993 changes in the Army's enlisted separation policy and procedures established failure to control weight as a distinct separation provision, replacing the previous policy of separation at the convenience of the government. Since 1986 the Army Weight Control Program (AWCP) has promoted readiness, health, and the physical appearance of soldiers in every component. By regulation, the Army weighs each soldier twice each year, and those exceeding the height/weight screening tables have their body fat measured. Commanders must enroll soldiers who exceed the body fat standard into the AWCP, where health care professionals provide nutrition counseling. Participating soldiers are weighed monthly and are expected to lose between three and eight pounds per month. Soldiers failing to make satisfactory progress and exceeding body fat standards after six months must undergo medical evaluations. Unless

doctors identify an underlying or associated disease condition, the soldier's commander must initiate a mandatory reenlistment bar or begin separation proceedings. During the fiscal year the Army separated 2,371 enlisted soldiers for failure to maintain body fat standards.

## Structuring and Training the Force

## Force Development

Fiscal year 1993 marked the advent of a wide spectrum of initiatives to better evaluate and record the readiness of the active component and reserve components. Within the ARSTAF, the ODCSOPS Force Readiness Division monitored readiness and efforts to improve the indicators to measure it. Outside the ARSTAF, a number of Army committees looked for means to improve the clarity of the status reports and to improve readiness projections in the Unit Status Reporting System.

On 19 May 1993, the Secretary of Defense established the Defense Science Board Readiness Task Force (DSB-RTF), with a charter to review DOD-wide readiness management systems and indicators. The task force's goal was to determine which system could best be utilized to detect the early warning signs of "hollowness" or degradation. Consisting of representatives from OSD, the Joint Staff, the service staffs, and other external agencies, the task force met each month, beginning in June, to collect information for its recommendations. The DSB-RTF plans to continue soliciting input and to publish a final report in May 1994. Defense planning guidance providing the first articulation of readiness standards for deploying forces was one of the task force's interim recommendations. The guidance included descriptions of readiness goals for each component, by force package and deployability.

In July 1993 the House Armed Services Committee requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) to assess the adequacy of readiness indicators for the services. To meet this requirement, the GAO sent investigators to various Army installations, including the National Training Center (Fort Irwin, California), the 24th Infantry Division (Fort Stewart, Georgia), and the 4th Infantry Division (Fort Carson, Colorado). During these visits the GAO sought to identify and validate several significant readiness indicators at the unit and installation levels. Among other factors, the GAO looked at the effect of borrowed military manpower on overall readiness and at the impact of reduced funding on training readiness. When completed, the GAO's findings will be incorporated into various readiness studies.

39

Also in July 1993, the Army published an update to AR 220-1, Unit Status Reporting (USR). The new regulation is scheduled to be effective in October 1993 for the active component and in January 1994 for the reserve components. AR 220-1 describes changes in evaluating equipment and personnel readiness that more accurately reflect the unit level readiness state. The publication also incorporates readiness lessons from the Army's participation in the Persian Gulf War. Later versions of the regulation are expected to reflect evolving readiness reporting requirements.

The Army developed the Installation Status Report (ISR) in July and August 1993 as a means for the Chief of Staff to monitor the fitness of the Army's existing infrastructure. A product of the USMA's Operations Research Center, under the supervision of the ACSIM, the ISR evolved into a useful tool to identify issues affecting force readiness. Information from the report was included in subsequent readiness reports and studies. For example, the ISR data on installation support for power projection and quality of life were included in the Chief of Staff's expanded definition of readiness. In light of growing funding constraints, the senior Army leadership, with the support of Congress, concluded that the new definition of readiness should cover more than the availability of soldiers, equipment, and training. The expanded definition included factors such as quality of life, maintenance backlog, modernization, leadership, base operations, property maintenance, environmental concerns, and financial funding. All agreed that this presented a better picture of the "health of the Army" based on a wider variety of readiness factors and programs.

Constrained funding forced the ARSTAF to set priorities for readiness issues and to look more closely at its management of the new Contingency Force Pool (CFP), a highly ready and deployable group of combat support and

## Chapter 4 - 1993 DAHSUM

combat service support units from the active and reserve components. The ODCSOPS Force Readiness Division began monitoring CFP readiness in FY 1993 and spearheaded initiatives to reduce funding shortfalls and maintain the highest possible readiness levels. The CFP's overall readiness increased each quarter of the fiscal year. By the end of the fiscal year, the CFP had reached readiness goals set by ODCSOPS and the senior Army leadership. The success of this ARSTAF effort led to the development of parallel initiatives by the Army National Guard (ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) to ensure the readiness of their CFP units through two mobilization enhancement initiatives, BOLD SHIFT and Project PRIME, respectively.

In FY 1993 the Army reviewed its retiree preassignment program in light of the changing world situation, downsizing, and significant budget constraints. DOD Directive 1352.1, issued 2 March 1990, stated the DOD policy that physically qualified military retirees could be ordered to active duty to fill personnel shortfalls due to mobilization or other emergencies, as described in Title 10, U.S. Code 672 and 688, and that the services could use as many retirees as necessary to meet security needs. The directive also required that services issue preassignment or contingent preassignment orders to retirees slotted against mobilization positions. Because a major war might prevent the preparation and transmittal of mobilization orders, orders should be prepared in peacetime for all retirees who are assigned, voluntarily or not, to positions that must be filled within thirty days of mobilization. Based largely on Persian Gulf War experience, current retiree preassignment guidance envisions the need for retirees to fill specific individual slots on the assumption that a large-scale call-up is improbable. Retirees might not be required for every contingency because each contingency would require different individual skills and expertise. Publishing, maintaining, and tracking retirees' preassignment orders were costly, complicated by the array of possible contingencies, and prone to change from turnover among retirees available to serve in the program. The Army can prepare only a limited number of preassignment orders owing to the increased cost of publishing, amending, and revoking orders. In the final quarter of the fiscal year, the DCSPER recommended a change to DOD Directive 1352.1. The DCSPER proposed using a memorandum containing preassignment instructions to serve the same purpose as a preassignment order, but without the order's requirement for amendments, revocations, or detailed tracking. The memorandum would eliminate preassignment orders and allow for issuing assignment orders only to those retirees approved for recall to meet specific requirements. While the DCSPER awaited approval for the submitted recommendation, the Army Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN) suspended issuance of preassignment orders. Approval of the DCSPER's memorandum plan was expected during the first half of FY 1994.

Completing a process that it had begun after the Persian Gulf War, the Army in June 1993 published a revised version of the 1986 FM 100-5, Operations . Like its predecessors, this field manual defined the Army's doctrine for defending the nation and accomplishing other missions assigned by the National Command Authorities. The new FM 100-5 did not include any major changes in tactical doctrine. The Army had successfully used the 1986 AirLand Battle version of FM 100-5 both to win the Cold War in Europe and to defeat Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf War. While the Army was staffing the manual in late 1992, the Army Vice Chief of Staff (VCSA), General Dennis J. Reimer, acknowledged that the new doctrine would not include any revolutionary changes from the AirLand Battle doctrine used during the Persian Gulf War. According to the VCSA, changes in the new FM 100-5 addressed multiple threats and the Army's role as a power-projection force, reflecting its ability to deploy forces. In addition, the VCSA said that the new manual would contain a little more emphasis on the deep attack, but that most of the doctrinal differences were evolutionary changes that reflected shifting world situations.

The new FM 100-5 focused more on force projection and recognized that the post-Cold War Army is smaller and based primarily in CONUS. Strategic mobility became critical because the Army had to be able to deploy quickly for any

crisis or contingency. The new doctrine also acknowledged the growing importance of operations other than war (OOTW). These expanding missions included peacekeeping, disaster assistance, and nation building, all of which FM 100-5 covered in a new chapter on OOTW. This chapter also envisioned combat troops being called upon to serve in a new role-to provide support to specialists, such as medics and engineers, who may be deployed to accomplish an operation's primary mission. The 1993 FM introduced the concept of battle space, or the use of the entire battlefield to dominate the enemy at any given location. FM 100-5 also manifested an increased emphasis on joint U.S. operations and combined operations with foreign allies. The FM added the concept of "versatility" to basic AirLand Battle tenets of agility, initiative, depth, and synchronization. Army leaders stressed versatility to help the power-projection Army prepare for both combat and operations other than war, as well as joint and combined operations.

During the fiscal year the Army played a major role in the preparation of Joint Publication 3.0, Doctrine for Joint Operations , published by the Joint Staff in September 1993. Joint Publication 3.0 was the keystone of a series of publications on joint operations. The Army was the lead agent for its publication. Doctrine for Joint Operations provided planners a framework for thinking about the full range of joint and multinational military operations from war to OOTW. FM 100-19, Domestic Support Operations , also published in FY 1993, represented a combined Army and U.S. Marine Corps effort to establish doctrine for a growing OOTW mission. The Army addressed other OOTW doctrinal issues, such as multinational peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance operations, in the draft FM 100-23, Peace Support Operations , which was being staffed for final approval in FY 1993. Once approved, it is expected to be published in early 1994.

## Force Structure

In FY 1993 the Army maintained one corps and two divisions in Europe and three divisions in the Pacific area to help meet regional conflicts and deployments. To assist these units during emergencies, the Army created the CFP, which includes one corps and five divisions from active component forces based in CONUS. The CFP represents the leading edge of the Army's power-projection capability and consists of airborne, air assault, light and mechanized infantry, and armored divisions. Army plans call for a reinforcing element of two corps and four active component divisions, and ultimately a sustainment force of eight reserve component divisions to follow the CFP during deployments from CONUS.

In FY 1993 the Army continued examining the mix of maneuver elements in heavy divisions. The armored and mechanized infantry divisions that fought during the Persian Gulf War had ten maneuver elements. There were six armor battalions and four mechanized infantry battalions in an armored division and five armor and five mechanized battalions in a mechanized infantry division. The end of the Cold War and downsizing, however, significantly affected this division mix. In the post-Cold War era, Soviet tank forces no longer posed a threat, and Army leadership desired more multipurpose divisions. By organizing an armored division of five armor and four mechanized infantry battalions and a mechanized infantry division of four armor and five mechanized battalions, the Army created heavy divisions that were mirror images of each other. These divisions had very similar capabilities, and the Army could deploy them almost interchangeably for several different types of operations or deployment missions. With fewer maneuver battalions, the heavy divisions were more deployable and better suited for the new power-projection Army.

In addition to making the heavy divisions more deployable for the growing number of overseas missions, the Army's decision to eliminate one maneuver element from each heavy division reduced the division force structure by seven battalions without cutting the number of divisions (the most visible sign of Army force structure strength). After the Army changes its division mix, it expects to have freed seven battalions, almost a division equivalent, without actually cutting another division. The seven battalions could be inactivated or used to increase the strength and readiness levels of other divisions and brigades. During the hurried downsizing in the years following the Persian Gulf War, the Army sought ways to cut force structure while maintaining as many divisions as possible, and this division restructuring was an important organizational modification.

By the end of FY 1993 the Army consisted of 4 corps, 14 active Army divisions, and 8 National Guard divisions. Under current plans the Army's force is scheduled to shrink. The Secretary of Defense's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) recommended that the Army continue to reduce to ten fully organized active Army divisions. The BUR also recommended cutting reserve component force structure to five divisions and thirty-seven combat brigades. Fifteen of these brigades would be "enhanced" to increase readiness and improve their ability to deploy throughout the world. The enhanced brigade is expected to assist the active Army's ability to reinforce units deployed to meet future regional conflicts.

The BUR recommended cutting the number of active divisions, but the remaining active divisions would be fully funded to avoid becoming "hollow." The Army decided that each active division in the new force structure would maintain three brigades, which could be accomplished by reorganizing and realigning resources during the downsizing effort. One division, the 7th Infantry Division (Light), consisted of only a headquarters and one maneuver brigade. The 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division (Light), completed its prescheduled move from Fort Ord, California, to Fort Lewis, Washington, during FY 1993. The 6th and 7th Infantry Divisions are scheduled to be inactivated by the end of the next fiscal year, with two additional active Army divisions scheduled to inactivate by FY 1997. Two National Guard divisions also were inactivated in FY 1993, and their resources were used to improve other Guard divisions and units.

Another force structure change took place on 16 December 1992 when the Army inactivated the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and transferred its personnel and equipment to the 2d Armored Division. Except for a brigade at Fort Hood, Texas, only the Headquarters, 2d Armored Division, had been active (at zero strength) since the end of FY 1991. The resources from the 5th Division's two inactivated brigades were used to activate the 2d Armored Division's two remaining maneuver brigades at Fort Polk. These two brigades prepared for a move and a permanent change of station to join their sister brigade, because the entire division is scheduled to be stationed at Fort Hood.

Most Army divisions reorganized their division support commands (DISCOM) and converted from single-function battalions (that is, separate medical, supply and transport, and maintenance battalions) to multifunctional support battalions before the Persian Gulf War. The 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions, which had retained their DISCOM organization, began adopting the new configuration in October 1992. Plans call for assigning one forward support battalion to sustain each of the three maneuver brigades in an airborne division and for a main support battalion to provide support for the other divisional elements. Each multifunctional support battalion is scheduled to have a company to provide medical support, one to provide maintenance, and another to perform the supply and transport function. The conversion to support battalions is scheduled for completion by the middle of the next fiscal year.

During the fiscal year the Army also studied the environmental impact and other effects of moving a heavy brigade from Germany to Fort Lewis, Washington, beginning in FY 1994. The brigade, expected to be the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, is scheduled to be inactivated and its assets moved by rail and ship from Germany to Fort Lewis. It is expected to become the CONUS-based brigade for the 2d Infantry Division in

Korea. The Secretary of the Army is expected to approve these actions sometime during the second quarter of FY 1994. In addition, a brigade of the 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized) is scheduled to inactivate, and its equipment is to be used to outfit a ship in the Pre-positioned (PREPO) Afloat Program.

As the U.S. Army reduced its presence in Europe, it also participated in a force structure realignment with significant impact on the future of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) military organization. In April the German 5th Panzer Division became part of the American V Corps and the U.S. 1st Armored Division was integrated into the German II Corps. These changes reflected NATO's decreasing military assets and a transition to more multinational military organizations.

As the end strength of the Army decreased, inactivations of TOE units continued in FY 1993. Although the decreases in Army divisions and brigades were the most obvious force structure changes, there was a corresponding decrease in units supporting combat divisions. Many combat support and combat service support units that escaped inactivation were reorganized and redesignated to reflect the changing missions and capabilities of the post-Cold War Army. Various branch proponents reevaluated force structure requirements in light of changing missions and resources. Table 10 shows select active component force structure from FY 1990 to FY 1993, and Table 11 shows active component divisions, by type, from FY 1990 to FY 1993.

The Army continued efforts during the fiscal year to field a light armored cavalry regiment to support rapid deployments of the XVIII Airborne Corps and to serve as the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) Opposing Force (OPFOR). Throughout much of the Cold War the Army maintained two armored cavalry regiments (ACR) in USAREUR and a third in CONUS. During the Persian Gulf War, the 2d ACR (from Germany) and the 3d ACR (from Fort Bliss, Texas) deployed Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and helicopters to help liberate Kuwait. ACRs were a powerful combat force, but during rapid deployments their heavy equipment gave logisticians almost the same problems as mechanized brigades. Under the post-Cold War drawdown, Army planners decided to gradually remove all

the ACRs from USAREUR, leaving the 3d ACR as the only "traditional" ACR. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and the ARSTAF, however, were already working on plans for a more readily deployable "cavalry" regiment. The new light armored cavalry regiment was designed to provide significant firepower but retain the versatility to deploy quickly for a wide range of contingency missions, from peacekeeping to a general war.

During FY 1993 the Army continued to develop a light ACR. The CSA approved plans in FY 1992 to return the 2d ACR to Fort Lewis, Washington, and to use the assets of the 199th Infantry Brigade (Separate) to organize a light ACR. The CSA called the 2d ACR the Army's "first purpose-built 21st-century combat unit." The regiment is scheduled to have three cavalry squadrons, an aviation squadron, and a support squadron, as well as an air defense artillery battery, an engineer company, a chemical company, and a military intelligence company. Pending the development and fielding of the Army's new light tank, the armored gun system (AGS), the ground squadrons of the light ACR are expected to be

46

equipped with High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV) and with HMMWVs mounting Tubelaunched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles.

Fielding of the light ACR began in FY 1993 when the 2d ACR's headquarters moved to Fort Lewis and the regiment's squadrons began activating, using the assets of the 199th. While executing a major reorganization, the regiment moved its home base from Fort Lewis to Fort Polk, Louisiana. As part of the move, two squadrons tested the regiment's deployability in Exercise OCEAN VENTURE III by loading more than 900 pieces of rolling stock aboard a Navy Fast Service Ship (FSS) at the Port of Tacoma, Washington. The FSS then sailed to within three miles of the North Carolina coastline, where the ACR's equipment was transferred to landing craft and brought ashore at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina. The exercise demonstrated that even under austere conditions, light cavalry forces could be deployed by sea. The 2d ACR completed its reorganization and moved to Fort Polk by the end of the fiscal year. Only the regimental aviation squadron remained to be activated in FY 1994, using the assets of the 4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry, but this 2d ACR element is expected to be stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

## Training

The Army's training goal in FY 1993 remained the preparation of a "Trained and Ready" force capable of completing any mission. The increasing number of deployments for operations other than war has heightened the need to train to Army standards. During the fiscal year the Army Staff worked to redefine training readiness and to more closely integrate the training of active Army and reserve component units.

Declining budgets, smaller force structures, and time spent away from training due to OOTW deployments forced the ARSTAF to maximize the Army's training investment at every level of the training base. In FY 1993 the Army continued to realign the training support structure as well as provide new training to active and reserve component units through the Total Army Training Study (TATS). The CSA approved TATS on 22 April 1993. TATS realigned the active and reserve component training support structure and created a new support structure incorporating new initiatives such as the Future Army Schools-Twenty-one (FAST) and BOLD SHIFT, cohesive, efficient, and missionfocused structures capable of providing enhanced collective and institutional training support to the Total Army. Both FORSCOM and TRADOC were developing concept plans to support TATS and expected to submit these plans for HQDA approval in FY 1994.

At the core of Army training improvements is the Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS), which uses a flexible system of training events and resource menus to plan and manage training. CATS identifies the most effective way to train its forces to an Army standard. CATS helps provide the training strategies for the total force and ensures that those plans interface with new combat developments, the systems approach to training (SAT), and the development of training aids, devices,

simulators, and simulations (TADSS). The TRADOC Deputy Chief of Staff for Training, the Army proponent for CATS, issued important guidance during the fiscal year. TRADOC Regulation 350-35, The Combined Arms Training Strategy , published 14 May 1993, defined CATS' roles and functions; and TRADOC Pamphlet 350-10, Combined Arms Training Strategy Development , published 23 August 1993, described how to develop CATS to get the most out of training. Separate CATS strategies were developed for the institution, the individual, and the unit.

The Army funded training using CATS as much as possible in FY 1993. Service schools developed unit strategies by the type of battalion. The Combined Arms Command-Training (CAC-T) and Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) developed descriptive unit strategies for echelons above battalion. These strategies served as guides for unit commanders and helped establish a sequence of representative training events to sustain a unit's proficiency in missionessential tasks. Various models calculated total miles traveled by vehicles in order to execute training events, while historical data was used to establish cost factors per training mile. The Army used this information in the planning, programming, budgeting cycle to justify and allocate sufficient resources. The Army also considered adopting an automated support program for CATS that would produce and update future strategies. Other Army automated systems under current development are expected to integrate CATS in the Training Module.

During the fiscal year the Army continued to seek improvements in the "troop schools" that conduct contracted training courses for soldiers. Since 1982 the AAA and the GAO had reviewed the Army's management controls over troop schools in three separate reports. Both agencies recommended that the Army consider alternative training sources for troop schools and develop controls to ensure that needs assessments were conducted before installations contracted for training. AR 350-41, Training in Units , published 19 March 1993, established the management controls recommended in the audits. The regulation listed sixteen courses authorized for contracting and directed all commands to consider the most cost-effective alternatives before contracting a course. AAA is expected to complete a confirmation audit by 20 July 1994 to determine whether AR 350-41 corrected the deficiencies noted by GAO and AAA audits and whether units followed the regulation. AAA planned to focus on several FORSCOM installations. Forts Bragg and Hood were the most likely loca-

48

tions. If the Army cannot correct internal control weaknesses, DOD is expected to direct the Army to discontinue troop schools in FY 1995.

The Army revised DA Pam 350-38/39, Standards in Weapons Training, in FY 1993. This revision was the culmination of a CSA-directed review of all training strategies and set an ammunition budget for FY 1994 of $293 million, which is expected to fully support the training ammunition requirement and allow the Army to meet its revised training plans. Maintaining readiness and weapons proficiency proved challenging during the fiscal year as the cost of training ammunition continued to increase.

During the fiscal year the CSA directed the DCSOPS to conduct an ammunition Functional Area Assessment (FAA) to improve ammunition management. The CSA planned to use the FAA to develop a programming and budgeting plan in support of the FY 1996-2001 POM and to provide the basis for managing the Army's ammunition stockpile. The assessment urged the Army to support the training ammunition requirement in full, but the senior Army leadership made no commitment. Budgeting for other training costs fared well in the POM development. These increases derived from the growing reliance on high technology training devices to offset the Army's shrinking ground resources and to mirror high technology weapons acquisitions.

In FY 1993 the Army continued conducting unilateral, joint, and combined training exercises. The Army conducted unilateral exercises at all levels from HQDA to corps and below, while the joint and combined exercises were usually conducted under the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). The CJCS exercises provided Army units with the opportunity to train under the operational control of the war-fighting Commanders in Chief (CINC) and helped ensure that U.S. forces were trained to accomplish CINC war plans. The Army participated in approximately fifty CJCS exercises during the fiscal year.

FUERZAS UNIDAS was a series of small-scale command post exercises (CPX) conducted in several Latin American

countries during FY 1993. The U.S. Southern Command and the host nation planned and conducted these exercises to portray low-intensity conflict. The small unit simulations particularly enhanced platoon- and company-level training. U.S. Army, South (USARSO), FORSCOM, and TRADOC personnel provided support for these exercises and helped run the simulations. During the fiscal year FUERZAS UNIDAS exercises were conducted in Uruguay, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Colombia.

The U.S. Southern Command also sponsored FUERTES CAMINOS, a series of joint and combined engineer and construction missions conducted in a number of developing countries within Central and South America. The exercises were designed to help host country nation-building projects

49

and contributed to their economic growth. Both active Army and reserve component engineer units, together with host nation forces, dug wells and built roads, schools, and dispensaries. Exercises were held in Panama, Guatemala, and El Salvador in FY 1993.

In FY 1993 KEEN EDGE, the annual large-scale joint and combined field training exercise (FTX) conducted in Japan, sought to increase the readiness and interoperability of the U.S. and Japanese forces. Army participants in the exercise, held in November 1992, included a brigade task force from the 6th Infantry Division (Light), elements of the 12th Special Forces Group, and combat service support units from CONUS. Also in FY 1993, COBRA GOLD, an annual medium-scale FTX and CPX in Thailand, worked to improve the military relationship between the American and Thai armies. A battalion task force from the 25th Infantry Division (Light) and elements of the 3d Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, represented the Army during the exercise.

TEAM SPIRIT and ULCHI-FOCUS LENS are major annual exercises conducted in Korea with the Republic of Korea military. TEAM SPIRIT, the Army's largest FTX, involved more than 200,000 participants in FY 1993. Held in March, the exercise aimed to improve combat readiness through joint and combined training that included global and tactical deployment. The exercise also practiced receiving reinforcements from outside Korea. Participants during the 1993 exercise were I Corps, 25th Infantry Division (Light), and a large number of reserve component combat service support units from CONUS. The Commanding General, U.S. Forces Korea, ran ULCHI-FOCUS LENS, a large-scale, computer-assisted, joint and combined CPX. The exercise was conducted in conjunction with the Republic of Korea's national mobilization exercise and used enhanced computer simulations up to the theater level. Player cells from the 2d Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), 2d Armored Division, 25th Infantry Division (Light), 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and XVIII Airborne Corps participated in the exercise from 19 August to 15 September.

In FY 1993 the Central Command CINC sponsored INTRINSIC ACTION, a joint and combined FTX conducted in Kuwait. The exercise incorporated unit rotations, and several times during the fiscal year a heavy battalion task force deployed to Kuwait by air and utilized pre-positioned supplies and equipment to become operational. Training included small unit tactics and a live fire FTX with Kuwaiti troops. Three INTRINSIC ACTION exercises were held during the fiscal year. FORSCOM provided forces for the first two exercises and USAREUR the last.

During the Cold War, REFORGER(Return of Forces to Germany) was the Army's premier annual training exercise that tested mobility and prepared the Army for large-scale deployments from CONUS to Europe.

50

REFORGER units were to reinforce troops stationed in Germany in order to thwart an attack from the east. In FY 1993 senior U.S. Army commanders in Europe did not believe this was a relevant scenario any longer and sought to structure an exercise to simulate deployment of forces from Germany to another location to fight with a combined force. The worsening situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the possibility of U.S. intervention prevented USAREUR from designing the new scenario. Instead, the FY 1993 REFORGER consisted of the Army Reserve's 310th Support Command (Theater Army) and Headquarters, USAREUR, conducting a computer-assisted exercise (CAX) to simulate

| logistical reinforcement of the European theater. The exercise revealed the strain of receiving forces in an area with limited transportation facilities. The Army also decided that beginning in FY 1994 the exercise would be renamed ATLANTIC RESOLVE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The CINC of U.S. Atlantic Command sponsored OCEAN VENTURE to train the Atlantic Command staff and service component commanders in crisis action planning procedures in a low- to mid-intensity contingency operations scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The Combat Training Center (CTC) program was in transition during FY 1993. In July the JRTC completed its move from Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, to Fort Polk, Louisiana, and reduced the number of training rotations. As part of a training modernization effort, the U.S. Army Simulations, Training, and Instrumentations Command (STRICOM) began testing Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) Instrumentation Systems in August.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The Army continued to prepare for future CTC rotations through the CTC Master Plan in FY 1993. The master plan outlined training for the projected force beginning in FY 1994 and included plans for the Army to allocate major resources during FYs 1996-2001 to sustain future CTC rotations. The plan also called for the Army to make major investments (using RDTE, OPA, and MCAfunding) to upgrade CTC "instrumented battlefields" so units can employ modern combat systems in accordance with operational doctrine. These upgrades support training analysis and provide feedback on the use of the new battlefield systems. In addition, Army investments are expected to support continued improvements to CTC instrumentation and training devices based on future technological updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| During the fiscal year, the National Training Center (NTC) conducted twelve two-battalion armor/mechanized brigade rotations. Typically, four of the twelve annual rotations involve a third light infantry maneuver battalion, but in FY 1993 a total of twenty-four heavy and seven light                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| maneuver battalions rotated through NTC. Each standard NTC rotation included the brigade headquarters, two mechanized infantry or armor battalion task forces, the aviation brigade (-), and the doctrinally appropriate combat support and combat service support (CS/CSS) units. Support units included a direct support field artillery battalion, a forward support battalion, an engineer battalion (-), a military intelligence platoon, a signal company, an air defense artillery battery, and other units that collectively form the brigade "support package." Training scenarios at the NTC focused on conventional mid- to high-intensity conflict. The rotating units participated in exercises against opposing forces (OPFOR) portrayed by the 177th Armored Brigade. During the fiscal year the Army planned for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which is scheduled to inactivate in Europe beginning in early FY 1994, to replace the 177th as the NTC's OPFOR unit in FY 1995. During FY 1993 the JRTC conducted eight two-battalion light infantry brigade(-) rotations. Sixteen light maneuver battalions and eight supporting heavy company teams rotated through the center. Each standard rotation included the brigade headquarters, two light infantry battalion task forces (which also included mountain, airborne, air assault, special forces, and ranger units), the aviation brigade (-), and doctrinally appropriate brigade CS and CSS units. The brigade's third maneuver battalion task force participated through a Brigade/Battalion Simulation (BBS) supported A Special Forces battalion (-) and Psychological and Civil Affairs units were present for all rotations, and ranger battalions and Special Operations Forces (SOF) aviation units joined at least one rotation. JRTC scenarios concentrated on conventional, peacekeeping, and special operations low- to mid-intensity conflict. The only battalion-level maneuver training site for units based in Europe is the Combat Maneuver Training Center. During the fiscal year each maneuver battalion in USAREUR received an opportunity to train at the CMTC. The funded the CMTC for 231 training days in FY 1993 and plans to increase that to 308 training days beginning in FY 1994. Each battalion is expected to participate in a five- to seven-day force-on-force exercise every fourteen months. |

Most brigades spent time at the Grafenwoehr Training Area honing their skills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

through live fire and gunnery exercises before going to the CMTC at Hohenfels. The CMTC scenarios focused on conventional operations or operations other than war in low- to high-intensity conflicts. During each rotation additional division- and corps-level units supported the rotating brigade from maneuver areas near Hohenfels. These additional units also took advantage of the CMTC scenario.

Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) scenarios focus on mid- to high-intensity conflicts. In FY 1993 each rotation consisted of a five-day doctrinal seminar at Fort Leavenworth, followed six months later by a Corps Battle Simulation (CBS) supported CPX at the unit's home station. Reserve component divisions, however, conducted both events at Fort Leavenworth. A corps CPX lasts seven days, and division exercises last for five days. During the fiscal year the BCTP conducted fourteen "division equivalent" Warfighter Exercise rotations with eight active and three reserve component divisions, one corps headquarters, and the Command and General Staff College's PRAIRIE WARRIOR exercise. The Army anticipated that the probable future annual training for the projected force structure would be two corps rotations, eight active component division rotations, and two to three reserve component division rotations, as well as continued support to PRAIRIE WARRIOR. SOF units were integrated during all corps rotations in FY 1993.

The Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT), which uses networked simulation technology, continued as the Army's highest priority training simulation project during FY 1993. CATT received full funding and set the standard for virtual training simulations throughout the Army. CATT's first subprogram, the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), is scheduled for fielding in FY 1994. The first prototype of the system-an M1A1 tank module-is expected to yield numerous training benefits. Throughout FY 1993 the Army expressed growing interest in fielding other CATT subprograms (Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer [AVCATT], Fire Support Combined Arms Tactical Trainer [FSCATT], Engineer Combined Arms Tactical Trainer [ENCATT], and Air Defense Combined Arms Tactical Trainer [ADCATT]) in upcoming years. In FY 1993 the Army funded all these programs in the FY 1996-2001 POM. AVCATT is scheduled to go into production in FY 2002, FSCATT in FY 2003, ENCATT in FY 2003, and ADCATT in FY 2006.

The family of constructive simulations stabilized during FY 1993 to include the CBS; the BBS; JANUS, the Army's battle focused trainer; and the Tactical Simulation (TACSIM). In FY 1993 the Army upgraded CBS to version 1.5 and minimal funding provided for future upgrades, based on Warrior Simulation 2000 becoming available in FY 1999. In FY 1993 the Army planned to upgrade CASCOM's Combat Service Support Tactical Simulation System (CSSTSS) to version 1.3 for participation in General Headquarters Exercise 94. The upgrade is expected to provide much improved combat service support game play. The Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) confederation of models in FY 1993 included CBS, Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM), TACSIM, Navy Warfare Simulation (NAWSIM), and limited connectivity with the Marine Tactical Warfare Simulation (MTWS). This confederation also is expected to sup- port the General Headquarters Exercise 94 and is scheduled to support ULCHI-FOCUS LENS 94 and ATLANTIC RESOLVE 94.

Joint and combined exercises involve most echelons and support combatant commands' operational plans. During FY 1993 FORSCOM reviewed the impact of increased frequency and scope of CJCS- and CINC-directed exercises on the Army. Preliminary indications revealed that these leader-intensive exercises reduced the quality of unit-level training. Exercise controller requirements, player requirements, and support requirements diverted battalion and brigade commanders' attention from unit battles to the training of higher headquarters and staffs. FORSCOM is conducting a feasibility study examining brigade-tailored CTC densities. Under this concept, three maneuver battalions rotate through or train simultaneously at a maneuver CTC. Through scheduling of longer brigade rotations, once every two years, the operational pace in low-density units may be reduced. The command is scheduled to report its findings during FY 1994. FORSCOM's CONUS-based active component divisions train several nonaligned reserve component units. In FY 1993 the Army sought to set priorities for active component division training support of early deploying reserve component

maneuver and CFP units. Plans call for TATS training organizations to be activated to train remaining reserve component forces.

## Deployed and Operational Forces

During the fiscal year the Army had approximately 125,000 soldiers stationed at forward-deployed bases in Europe, Korea, and Panama. On an average day the Army had 20,000 troops deployed to approximately seventy-five nations performing more than a thousand operational missions in FY 1993. These deployments represented a 100 percent increase in operational missions from the previous fiscal year.

## Deployed Operational Forces

In FY 1993 the Army continued to demonstrate the nation's commitment to security and peace in Southwest Asia (SWA) through numerous training and operational deployments. At any given time more than 2,300 soldiers were deployed in the SWA area of operations. This did not include operations in Somalia and the influx of troops for large exercise deployments. More than 1,300 soldiers were deployed with Army Forces Central Command (ARCENT) Forward and approximately 1,000 served with the Multinational Force and Observer (MFO) organization. Soldiers and civilian contractors maintained pre-positioned stocks of Army materiel at various locations in the area, and other soldiers participated in training both U.S. and allied forces. In July 1992 the Third Army (one of the ARCENT headquarters) created Joint Task Force-Kuwait (JTF-K) in Doha to provide command and control for battalion task forces that deployed on INTRINSIC ACTION exercises. JTF-K remained active during several INTRINSIC ACTION rotations, but as tensions with Iraq abated the task force inactivated on 20 December 1992.

In FY 1993 the Army continued to support Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, the enforcement of the United Nations (UN) "no-fly" zone in southern Iraq. During the fiscal year the Army stationed a Patriot missile battalion, with its own maintenance and security force, in Saudi Arabia to provide air defense for Joint Task Force-Southwest Asia (JTFSWA). Air defense artillery (ADA) units that deployed to or served in the region included the 3d Battalion, 43d ADA Regiment (July to November 1992); 1st Battalion, 43d ADA Regiment (November 1992 to March 1993); 2d

55

Battalion, 7th ADA Regiment (March to August 1993); and 6th Battalion, 43d ADA Regiment (August 1993 to its scheduled departure in December 1993). During a period of heightened tension with Iraq in FY 1992, the Army deployed two additional Patriot batteries. The 1st Battalion, 7th ADA Regiment, deployed Battery B to Bahrain and Battery D to Kuwait in July 1992, and the batteries returned home in December 1992.

In FY 1993 the Army maintained a high training OPTEMPO in the area, conducting three rotations for INTRINSIC ACTION exercises in Kuwait. These exercises featured a heavy battalion task force deploying from either USAREUR or CONUS that relied on the use of pre-positioned equipment. A typical task force would consist of two armor and two mechanized infantry companies, an artillery battery, an engineer company, and attached logistical support. Once the troops deployed, they conducted training exercises that were usually small unit FTXs and live fire exercises (LFX) with Kuwaiti Army units. In addition, Special Operations Forces conducted two iterations of Exercise IRIS GOLD, in which a company from the 5th Special Forces Group deployed and trained Kuwaiti units on individual and small unit collective tasks.

These deployments demonstrated to potential adversaries the Army's capability and the nation's commitment to defend its allies in the region. On at least one training operation during the fiscal year, the scheduled date for an INTRINSIC ACTION exercise was advanced to signal Iraq that violations of the Kuwaiti border would not be tolerated. In midJanuary 1993 an Army task force from the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, deployed to Kuwait after Iraq refused to abandon police posts in the demilitarized zone separating the two nations. JTF-K was reactivated on 15 January 1993 as the command and control headquarters for the battalion task force, as well as for

Battery C, 1st Battalion, 7th ADA Regiment, special operations forces, and the personnel permanently assigned to the Army Training and Security-Kuwait (ARTAS-K). Approximately 1,100 soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, deployed rapidly to Kuwait. The Iraqi Army eventually withdrew from the demilitarized zone.

During FY 1993 the Army continued support of the MFO in the Sinai Desert. Troops from several nations constitute the MFO, an independent peacekeeping mission created as a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt. The U. S. Army has contributed forces since 1982, providing soldiers to the MFO staff, as well as logistics support and an infantry battalion. The Army infantry battalion assigned to the MFO serves a sixmonth rotation. During each rotation American MFO soldiers man observation posts along the southern sector of the Sinai and monitor movements for treaty violations. When not in forward posts, infantry battalion elements train to maintain proficiency in their individual and small unit skills. Civili an employees and contractors, as well as the 1st U.S. Support Battalion, Sinai, provide logistical support for the MFO. Soldiers assigned to the support battalion rotate on a one-year tour. During the fiscal year units that deployed for MFO tours included the 2d Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division (August 1992 to January 1993), and the 1st Battalion, 504th Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division (January to July 1993). The 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, arrived for MFO duty in July 1993 and is scheduled to remain until January 1994.

The Army's effort to help the starving people of Somalia was the service's major overseas deployment during the fiscal year and the largest since the Persian Gulf War. Civil unrest, lawlessness among a small percentage of the population, and fighting among the Somali clans prevented farmers from raising their own crops, and hundreds of thousands of refugees, mostly in the countryside, faced starvation and death. The humanitarian effort that involved the deployment of Army ground forces to Somalia began on 16 August 1992 with Operation PROVIDE RELIEF. The operation consisted of a joint task force of approximately six hundred personnel delivering supplies to northern Kenya and southern Somalia. The U.S. military, United Nations, and other relief agencies successfully delivered food and supplies to selected storage facilities in Somalia, but the fighting and criminal activity made it difficult to get food and aid into the hands of those that needed it most. International aid organizations operating in Somalia were frustrated by the local conditions and had to hire armed guards or pay tribute to protect food supplies from rival clansmen who used the food to reward their own followers. Although the UN had some troops in Somalia, they were lightly armed and unable to establish order or maintain control outside of their compound.

The worsening situation in Somalia brought calls for intervention that led to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) intervening in Somalia to create a secure environment favorable to renewing civilian relief operations. CENTCOM established Joint Task Force Somalia, later called United Task Force Somalia (UNITAF), under Lt. Gen. Robert B. Johnston (USMC) to control the military forces in Somalia. The major Army unit in Somalia was the 10th Mountain Division (Light) from Fort Drum, New York, and its commanding general, Maj. Gen. Steven Lloyd Arnold, served as the commander of Army Forces, Somalia. The Army provided most of UNITAF's logistics support, and Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon commanded the Joint Task Force Support Command, whose major units included the 593d Support Group (from Fort Lewis), 36th Engineer Group (Fort Benning), 7th Transportation Group (Fort Eustis), and 62d Medical Group (Fort Lewis). Other Army units included elements from the 5th

Special Forces Group and the 8th Psychological Operations Battalion, which together formed UNITAF's Special Operations Forces Somalia, and the Joint Psychological Operations Task Force.

The 2d Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, deployed to Somalia on 10 December in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE. The operation began on 9 December when U.S. marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force made a night amphibious landing near the international airport in Mogadishu. After occupying the airport and the terminal buildings, the marines took control of the city's port facilities. Although the airport runways were small, the U.S. Air Force flew supplies, equipment, and additional marines and soldiers into Mogadishu. As the international

presence grew, UNITAF began moving into troubled areas outside of Mogadishu. The Army eventually had responsibility for four of nine Humanitarian Relief Zones, centered on the cities of Kismayu, Baledogle, Baidoa, and Marka and covering more than 21,000 square miles. U.S. Military forces (all services) in Somalia reached their peak strength of more than 25,800 on 16 January 1993.

Despite occasional sniper attacks against troops and facilities, UNITAF solicited working agreements among the warring clans and eventually established order within Somalia. General Arnold established a "Four No's" policy-no bandits, no checkpoints (to collect payments from relief convoys), no technicals (Somali vehicles with mounted weapons), and no visible weapons-for territory under his control. Under outside supervision, clans began turning in some of their weapons. When necessary, UNITAF forces engaged Somalis who threatened their security. Through peaceful persuasion and the controlled use of force, UNITAF accomplished its primary mission of restoring sufficient order to allow food convoys to reach relief centers. Army engineer units also constructed roads, bridges, and other infrastructure to help rebuild the country and keep the food convoys moving.

On 4 May 1993, Operation RESTORE HOPE ended when UNITAF, a peace-making organization, was replaced with United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II), charged with a peacekeeping mission. Although most of the Army and Marine units had withdrawn by the end of Operation RESTORE HOPE, approximately 5,000 troops maintained the U.S. presence in Somalia during UNOSOM II in support of U. S. Operation CONTINUE HOPE. A second rotation of units arrived in Somalia from the 10th Mountain Division to organize a quick reaction force (QRF) that could reinforce UN troops in emergencies. An infantry battalion and an aviation task force, with a total of approximately 1,400 soldiers, formed the QRF. The remaining 3,600 U.S. soldiers in Somalia helped provide logistical support to the United Nations forces. Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery was the deputy commander of UNOSOM II and commander of the U.S. Army forces in Somalia. UNOSOM II consisted of four phases: Phase I, the transition from UNITAF to UNOSOM II; Phase II, the consolidation of controlled areas and expansion to other areas in central and northern Somalia; Phase III, transferring control back to Somali civilian authority; and Phase IV, redeployment. Increasing violence on the part of clan leaders, notably Mohammed Farah Aideed, endangered the prospects for peace and the establishment of a new government.

In early June 1993 Aideed's forces ambushed UN (Pakistani) peacekeeping troops, killing more than twenty and wounding more than fifty. After these attacks, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for the arrest and detention of those responsible. UN forces in Somalia launched a series of raids against Aideed and his supporters, but after they failed to capture him the United Nations issued an arrest warrant for the clan leader. On 12 July U.S. helicopters killed approximately fifty Somalis during an attack on one of Aideed's strongpoints. Civil unrest in Somalia increased as clan mobs rioted and killed four journalists. Hostile Somali activity forced UNOSOM troops to tighten security for the food convoys and their cantonment areas.

In August the Army sent approximately 400 rangers to Mogadishu to reinforce the 10th Mountain Division QRF and help capture Aideed. This deployment followed the 8 August death of four U.S. Soldiers and the wounding of another six on 22 August. Aideed followers in Mogadishu used remotely controlled mines or bombs to destroy the soldiers' vehicles. After arriving in late August, the rangers launched their first raids against hostile Somalis. Both UN forces and Somalis died in the raids involving helicopter gunship strikes and ambushes that continued through September. Although the rangers captured some of his assistants, they were unable to capture Aideed. U.S. forces lost several wounded in these operations, and three soldiers were killed on 25 September when Aideed's troops, equipped with rocket launchers, succeeded in shooting down an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. By 30 September the U.S. Army had suffered seventy-three casualties in Somalia, including eight hostile and four nonhostile deaths.

Operation PROVIDE PROMISE, the Army's humanitarian assistance and support to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in areas of the former Republic of Yugoslavia, began in July 1992. The Army supported United Nations operations in the new nations of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia with personnel and equipment.

## Chapter 5 - 1993 DAHSUM

Army personnel served in Joint Task Force PROVIDE PROMISE headquarters in Naples, Italy, and in its forward headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. The Army also assigned personnel to UN headquarters in Sarajevo and UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb. Other Army soldiers in the Balkans included liaison officers to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, also headquartered in Zagreb.

On 2 October 1992, at the request of UN officials, President Bush authorized the deployment of a military hospital to support the 20,000 UN troops conducting peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. The medical mission was subsequently modified to authorize the provision of medical services to severely wounded Bosnian children. As part of Operation PROVIDE PROMISE, approximately 150 soldiers from the 212th Surgical Hospital (Mobile Army) deployed from USAREUR to Zagreb, Croatia, on 10 November 1992, with approximately 160 more personnel deploying within the next few days. Medical personnel from several USAREUR hospitals and medical units filled out the ranks of the 212th.

The 212th established a hospital using DEPMEDS (Deployable Medical Systems) shelters at Zagreb's Pleso Airport. Medical personnel took advantage of the airport's existing structures, and part of the hospital facility was built under a large hangar. During its six-month tour, the 212th cared for more than 5,000 patients from approximately thirty-five nations, including Russia, Ukraine, and Poland. The 502d Surgical Hospital (Mobile Army) replaced the 212th on 26 April 1993, moving into the 212th's existing DEPMEDS hospital. Again medical personnel from throughout USAREUR were needed to fill out the 502d's ranks for the deployment. The 502d is scheduled to be replaced in October 1993 by the U.S. Air Force 48th Air Transportable Hospital. Most hospital equipment is expected to remain in Zagreb and be transferred from one hospital to another as the various services take turns operating hospitals during this medical support mission.

In February 1993, after fighting in Bosnia cut off large civilian and refugee populations and forced them to take refuge in isolated pockets, the United States participated in humanitarian aid airdrops. The United States helped assemble and package food and medical supplies for airdrops into remote areas that were not accessible to ground transportation and UN-sponsored relief convoys. The Army provided numerous personnel and airdrop equipment from the 5th Quartermaster Detachment, based in Germany, and the 21st Theater Army Area Command, from Vicenza, Italy. Reserve component units later joined the effort and also provided rigger support for parachute units.

In FY 1993 the Army contributed lawyers to an interservice group of military justice and international lawyers drafting rules for a UN-sanctioned international tribunal to prosecute individuals responsible for committing serious violations of international humanitarian law within the territory of the former Yugoslavia. UN Resolution 827 (1993) approved the Statute of the International Tribunal and encouraged states to suggest procedural and evidentiary rules. The rules are expected to promote fair and effective prosecution but not establish precedents that might someday inhibit lawful military operations.

In FY 1993 tensions rose in the Balkans as the former Republic of Yugoslavia broke into autonomous republics. The prospects of a full-scale war over territorial and ethnic differences grew among the new Balkan countries. Macedonia, one of the new republics, faced the possibility of intervention by its neighbors, particularly Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania. In response to reports of a Serbian military buildup along their border with Macedonia, the United Nations deployed a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) consisting of 700 troops contributed by various Nordic countries to monitor the frontier. The Army's involvement on the ground in Macedonia began in July 1993 when a reinforced infantry company from the Berlin Brigade joined UNPROFOR. The majority of the 315 soldiers deployed to Macedonia were members of Company C, 6th Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment. Like the Scandinavian troops, the Americans manned checkpoints, observed military activities, and reported violations to the United Nations. The requirement for U.S. troops in Macedonia is ongoing, and units are scheduled to rotate the UNPROFOR assignment.

In FY 1993 the Army contributed surplus medical supplies and equipment in support of Operation PROVIDE HOPE,

the transfer of humanitarian supplies to former Soviet republics. A program sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Humanitarian and Refugee Affairs made the equipment available for this humanitarian aid. The closure of a war-reserve hospital in England and several of the 7th Medical Command's (MEDCOM) hospitals in Germany created the excess medical stocks, and the command undertook a number of Operation PROVIDE HOPE missions during the fiscal year. Transferred equipment included intravenous fluids, surgical instruments, laboratory equipment, sterilizers, X-ray processors, operating room tables, bed frames, mattresses, pillows, blankets, sheets, and gowns. The 7th MEDCOM also deployed teams to help install the equipment and train medical personnel. Between August and November 1992, the command provided equipment to two hospitals in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia. Again, between February and May 1993, during Operation PROVIDE HOPE II, the Army shipped approximately $13 million in excess medical equipment to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and 7th MEDCOM deployed approximately fifty personnel to support the operation. Operation PROVIDE HOPE III deployments began in late September. Fifty more soldiers arrived in Moscow to deliver another donation of medical provisions valued at $28 million. This deployment is scheduled to end by late October.

On 3 July 1993, Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, representing the military leaders who in 1991 had deposed Haiti's first democratically elected president, signed the Governor's Island Agreement that set the conditions for returning President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office by 30

61

October 1993. The U.S. Atlantic Command formed a Haiti Assistance Group (HAG) the next month to prepare for a possible humanitarian civic assistance mission. The HAG also began designing a professional development program for Haitian forces to teach them about civil rights and help alleviate corruption in the Haitian military.

When the United Nations suspended its embargo against Haiti, it authorized the deployment of an eighteen-member site survey team to visit the country from 7 to 11 September 1993. This team consisted of international police monitors and representatives of the United Nations, the Atlantic Command, and the State Department. The U.S. Army provided eight of the team members and later contributed four members of an interim team that the Haitians requested to keep a UN presence in the country. On 22 September a fifteen-member HAG advance party, consisting of fourteen Army personnel, replaced the interim survey team and prepared for the arrival of the HAG itself. The HAG's main body contained between 500 and 600 personnel from the 2d Battalion of 3d Special Forces Group, TRADOC, and XVIII Airborne Corps and included aviation, communications, logistics, and medical personnel. When the USS Harlan County arrived at Port-au-Prince carrying the main body of the HAG, Haitian protesters and troublemakers did not allow the ship to dock safely. Haitian security and police forces openly supported the armed mob at the port. After Cedras refused to guarantee the safety of the U.S. Military personnel, on 12 October President Clinton ordered the Harlan County to leave Haitian waters. As a result, the United Nations reimposed sanctions against Haiti.

## Support to Civilian Authorities

In FY 1993 the Army continued relief operations that began in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. The few domestic deployments during this fiscal year did not match the scale of the Hurricane Andrew relief. Table 12 shows the most significant Army deployments in support of civilian authorities during FY 1993.

## TABLE 12-MAJOR ARMY DEPLOYMENTS IN SUPPORT OF CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES, FY 1993

| Event                   | Date                        | Location                         |   Personnel |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Federal Law Enforcement | March                       | Waco, Texas                      |          23 |
| Midwest Floods          | July-August                 | Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas |         597 |
| California Fires        | August-September California | August-September California      |         274 |

DOD supported the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) during the Midwest floods with the Army Corps of Engineers and other military assets. Aircraft and soldiers were provided to the National Interagency Fire Center to help fight wildfires raging in southern California. The Army also supported requests from federal law enforcement agencies for assistance during their cordoning of a religious cult stronghold in Waco, Texas.

One of the most effective ongoing means for the Army to provide support for civilian authorities is the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) program. Under MAST, Army air ambulance helicopters transport serious medical emergencies that require rapid air transportation to a medical facility. MAST units provide their assistance to communities lacking services or when they are the only means of evacuation. MAST flying hours are provided from the existing flying hour program on a non-reimbursable basis to its beneficiaries. Twelve Army aeromedical evacuation units provided lifesaving treatment or patient evacuation for civilians in sixteen communities during FY 1993. Army units flew 2,141 flight hours participating in 1,321 MAST missions that transported 1,366 patients.

The Army Shelter for the Homeless Program assists communities and charitable organizations in creating shelters by providing a physical plant and basic incidental services. The program dates back to January 1983, when the White House directed the Secretary of Defense to provide "under utilized" military installation facilities to shelter the nation's homeless. In February 1983 the Army responded by allowing overnight shelters in Army Reserve Centers and extending the program to active Army facilities in August. Congress enacted the statutory authority for the program in 10 U.S.C. 2546 in October 1983. This allowed military installations to provide shelter and incidental services to local relief agencies that administer the program, including religious organizations, volunteer groups, and subcontracted social welfare professionals.

The Army supported seven homeless shelters during the fiscal year: the Carroll House (Forest Glen, Maryland); the Washington House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania); the Kennedy Shelter (Fort Belvoir, Virginia); Sarah's House (Fort Meade, Maryland); Monmouth House Shelter (Fort Monmouth, New Jersey); Ozanam Shelter (Camp Kilmer, New Jersey); and the St. Martin de Porres Shelter (Seattle, Washington). These shelters provided 510 beds and sheltered more than 6,000 homeless. In addition to the homeless shelters, installations may fund incidental services such as security, utilities, bedding, transportation, renovation and minor repairs, and property liability insurance. The Army also provides bedding to homeless shelters operated by other relief agencies. Army support for the homeless totaled $1.071 million in FY 1993.

In FY 1993 the Army continued counterdrug operations as part of DOD's effort in the National Drug Control Strategy. The Army performed a variety of missions in the war against drugs, supporting five major joint commands, more than forty federal law enforcement agencies, and more than 2,000 local law enforcement agencies throughout the nation. During the fiscal year the Army received approximately $372 million, or 29 percent, of DOD's fiscal year total $1.263 million for counterdrug activities.

Army counterdrug activities aimed to reduce demand, detect and monitor drug traffic, and support state drug plans through the Army National Guard under the provisions of Title 32, U.S. Code, for employing the Army National Guard in support of civilian drug law enforcement agencies (DLEA). The Army's materiel research, development, and acquisition process provided important support to law enforcement agencies in their war against drugs. In FY 1993 the Army helped field the Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL) and the Trafficking Emplaced Sensor Operational Network (TESON) to provide critically needed detection and monitoring capabilities in the war against drugs.

During the fiscal year the Army loaned or leased more than $135 million worth of equipment to civilian DLEAs. Types of equipment loaned included rifles (M14s and M16s), shotguns, night vision devices, vehicles, and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Four strategically located regional Army logistics support offices provided logistics support to the DLEAs and reported directly to DOD. The Army supported more than 95 percent of the DLEA training requests during the

## Chapter 5 - 1993 DAHSUM

fiscal year. The Army provided training to law enforcement personnel at various TRADOC schools or through mobile training teams. The Army's military police school taught the most frequently requested courses.

During the fiscal year the steady flow of cocaine from South America into the United States continued to be the primary drug threat to the nation, but a significant increase in heroin production has also been reflected in the U.S. market. The Army assisted in combating the flow of drugs at their source by providing training and equipment to host nations along the source and transit routes to the United States. The Army also contributed personnel to the approximately 1,200 military and civilian personnel in Honduras under the control of the U.S. Southern Command. Most of the military personnel were U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force members of Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF Bravo). The task force supervised American forces deployed to Honduras, coordinated logistics and engineering projects, and assisted the local government with counterdrug operations.

Created in the 1980s, JTF Bravo had been involved with monitoring Communist and rebel activities in Nicaragua and El Salvador, but by FY 1993 it had moved further into its new major role against drug trafficking. JTF Bravo provided the counterdrug forces of Latin American govern-

64

ments with training in the war against drugs. The task force conducted fifteen missions during FY 1993 in support of the U.S. Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Army personnel assisted in training law enforcement agents who conducted the counterdrug raids. The Army's role in the raids was usually limited to transporting agents looking for drug activity. In FY 1993 raids resulted in the capture of four aircraft and $150 million in cocaine. JTF Bravo personnel also supported Navy and Coast Guard operations that attempted to track smugglers off the Honduran coast and ran radar tracking stations that tracked planes that could be involved in the drug trade.

Army aviation continued supporting Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT) during FY 1993. The Royal Bahamian Police Force, the Turks and Caicos Islands Police, and the U.S. Customs Service, Coast Guard, and DEA executed OPBAT missions with transportation assistance from Army UH-60 helicopters.

In FY 1993 Army counterdrug activities also increased within the continental United States as part of DOD's Joint Task Force-6 (JTF-6) deployed along the nation's southwest border in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Since 1989 JTF-6 has been the DOD headquarters that works with the civilian law enforcement consortium called Operation ALLIANCE, and both organizations operate from Fort Bliss, Texas. JTF-6 is responsible for coordinating the activities of active Army and reserve component units involved in counterdrug operations in the Southwest. The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 and Title 10 of the U.S. Code prohibit direct active duty military participation in law enforcement. JTF-6 takes action only at the request of civilian agencies. Operation ALLIANCE receives requests for assistance and determines if it is best accomplished using JTF-6 military assets.

Army support in this counterdrug effort involves several types of missions. Much of the area near and along the border is uninhabited and consists of remote terrain where units on field exercises can also perform reconnaissance missions to look for illegal cultivation or evidence of drug traffic. Often battalion-size units are called into an area of known drug activity and the mere presence of a large armed force is enough to disrupt the drug activity. Units are often sited along popular drug trafficking routes, which forces the diversion of the illegal activities to other routes where the criminals can be arrested by civilian law enforcement personnel. Engineering support includes improving border fences and roads. Army personnel also aid with linguistic support and intelligence analysis and provide useful training in military skills to civilian law enforcement officers. Participating units bring specialized equipment such as night vision goggles that can also benefit law enforcement. During the fiscal year the number of counterdrug missions jumped 22 percent from FY 1992. More than 800 missions were conducted in FY 1992 and FY 1993.

Army units that deployed to support JTF-6 activities during FY 1993 included the 3d Battalion, 22d Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, and the 2d Battalion, 505th Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division.

Across the nation during the fiscal year, approximately 5,000 Army National Guard personnel provided daily counterdrug support in all fifty states, plus Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. Their missions included supporting inspections of vehicles and containers by the U.S. Customs Service at U.S. points of entry, manning observation and listening posts near international borders or clandestine airstrips, conducting air surveillance of suspected drug activities, marijuana eradication, and supporting DLEA personnel through intelligence, data processing, and training activities.

## Army Special Operations Forces

On 3 March 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin formally designated Civil Affairs (CA) and Psychological Operations (PSYOP) forces as Special Operations Forces (SOF). Although this designation had no impact on the Army financially or operationally, it did clarify the legal basis and command authority under which the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) managed these assets. Until the designation of CA and PSYOP forces as SOF, the USSOCOM and the Army shared responsibility for managing them through an intricate and often changing command structure that originated in October 1987 when DOD assigned all Army and Air Force CA and PSYOP forces to USSOCOM but did not designate them as SOF. After 1987 ambiguities and misunderstandings developed because the lines of command and control were uncertain. Although the Army viewed CA and PSYOP forces as SOF, the administrative documentation prepared by DOD and other joint organizations did not. Conflicting guidance and policies often confused and frustrated planners and unit commanders.

When the USSOCOM recommended the designation of CA and PSYOP forces as SOF, the Army concurred, but the Chief, Army Reserve (CAR), did not. Many CA and PSYOP units are part of the Army Reserve, and the CAR argued that the designation was not in the best interest of the Total Army because assignment to USSOCOM would eventually erode their visibility and affect funding. The CAR also pointed out that CA and PSYOP forces supported conventional operations as well as SOF missions. The Army disagreed, after concluding that the SOF designation was the best way to serve CA and PSYOP forces and that it was in the Army's best interest for them to remain under the USSOCOM and its Army component, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). Secretary Aspin's designation decision enhanced USSOCOM's ability to organize, train, equip, and manage the SOF and eliminated legal ambiguities and institutional misunderstandings.

SOF supported Army operations worldwide in FY 1993. During Operation RESTORE HOPE, the effort to bring order and distribute food in Somalia, SOF took part in the hunt for rebel leader Aideed, and civil affairs troops were vital for the U.S. effort to create conditions for long-term stability in Somalia. In another operation, two Army Civic Action Teams (CAT) assisted the U.S. Pacific Command's support for recently established governments on various Pacific islands. The CATs provided expertise on public facility and infrastructure construction, on-the-job training, and limited medical assistance to citizens whose governments are part of the Compact of Free Association. These are new island governments created when the United States relinquished its trusteeship of certain Pacific islands that Japan had occupied during World War II. During the fiscal year civil affairs also played significant roles in Operation PROVIDE COMFORT, the ongoing effort to assist Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq and Turkey, and Operation PROVIDE PROMISE, the effort to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in the war-ravaged Balkans.

In FY 1993 the Army reviewed CA and PSYOP requirements in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), 1993-95, and the Army Mobilization and Operations Planning and Execution System (AMOPES). As a result, the Army revised the PSYOP and CA force structure requirements and documentation to align these SOF functions with the service's post-Cold War missions. The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) also reexamined its force requirements for civil affairs missions in FY 1993. CENTCOM determined that its requirements could be met with regionally oriented CA forces in the active component and by using more civil affairs volunteers from the Army Reserve. SOF planners on the Army Staff pushed to have CA and PSYOP forces included in the Contingency Force Pool along with other highpriority reserve component units. Based on the new JSCP and AMOPES guidance, the Army gave funding priorities to CA and PSYOP units that could support these plans.

## Military Intelligence

Army intelligence activities underwent some significant changes in FY 1993. The consolidation and downsizing efforts resulting from the National Performance Review eliminated many redundant programs and moved the Army closer to a joint integration of intelligence activities.

Several organizational changes took place within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ODCSINT) during the fiscal year. In October 1992 the U.S. Army Intelligence Operations Detachment (USAIOD) converted from an ODCSINT field operating agency (FOA) to

67

a staff support agency (SSA) after a review determined that it was a dysfunctional FOA that performed HQDA staff, staff support, and operational functions. USAIOD's personnel and functions were realigned between ODCSINT and the new USAIOD, with ODCSINT retaining the policy, planning, and programming functions and USAIOD performing functions in support of ODCSINT policy, planning, and programming missions. As an SSA, USAIOD's primary mission is to provide direct management support to ODCSINT by preparing analytical reports, assisting in the formulation of procedures, and providing professional, technical, administrative, or logistical support. USAIOD's former operational functions were transferred to the Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).

As Army strength continued to decline, the ODCSINT coordinated the reduction of intelligence end strength throughout the Army in FY 1993. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence directed the creation of an Intelligence Integration Initiative to help consolidate the ODCSINT and Headquarters, INSCOM. This merger is expected to save 400 positions and streamline the organization.

In Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, the Army required translators to accompany U.S. Troops and communicate with Somali citizens. Because interpreters worked closely with American units, there was a possibility that some translators would need access to classified documents. In December 1992 ODCSINT and INSCOM helped to assemble and screen Somalis living in the United States who could serve as translators for U.S. Forces deployed to that country. Technically each Somali was employed by BDM, Inc., which was under contract to the Army. Almost two hundred were screened during the fiscal year, and at any one time between seventy and one hundred translators were on duty in Somalia. The program was so successful that the Canadians and Australians requested assistance with translator acquisition.

The Army Language Program Review Committee (ALPRC) returned in February 1993, after a two-year hiatus, under the chairmanship of the Assistant DCSINT. The ALPRC, formed in the late 1980s and headed by the DCSINT, was the outgrowth of a DCSINT and DCSOPS general officer steering committee recommendation to provide a forum for MACOM and ARSTAF components of the Army Language Program. The Director of the Army Language Program, who advised the DCSINT on convening the committee, advised against it in 1991 and 1992. The committee reconvened in 1993 to address problems in the Army Language Program. The ALPRC primarily studied the shortage of linguists in critical languages such as Arabic and the surplus of some European languages. To satisfy potential requirements in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ODCSINT coordinated the cross-training of 300 Russian, Czech, and Polish linguists in SerboCroatian. Additional Army linguists fluent in Macedonian and Albanian

68

were needed to support deployments to Macedonia under Operation ABLE SENTRY. When the Defense Language Institute could not provide enough linguists, the Army turned to the reserve components to provide many of these skilled personnel. The ODCSINT also helped provide linguists to support Task Force Russia's search for information on American POWs and MIAs and to analyze Iraqi documents captured during Operation DESERT STORM.

In anticipation of possible deployment to the Balkans, the ODCSINT continued developing a policy dealing with low-

level source operations (LLSO). The ODCSINT extended authorization to conduct LLSOs to Army elements in EUCOM to support contingencies in non-NATO European nations and in Africa. LLSO authority was reaffirmed for Army elements in SOUTHCOM and CENTCOM theaters, and in August 1993 the Army distributed the final coordinating draft of AR 381-172, Low Level Source Operations , to the field for comments. Reflecting the Army's growing commitment to support operations other than war, the ODCSINT created the Army's first policy on the use of military intelligence and counterintelligence assets to support military operations responding to civil disturbances and natural disasters. The new policy was incorporated in AR 381-20, U.S. Army Counterintelligence Activities , and FM 100-19, Domestic Support Operations . In January 1993 AR 381-12, Subversion and Espionage Directed Against the Army (SAEDA), was published, superseding the 1981 version. Some of the changes included a requirement for commanders to ensure that SAEDA incidents, illegal diversions of technology, and actual or attempted intrusions into automated systems be reported. The ODCSINT also completed a CONUS threat assessment for the Corps of Engineers (COE) that is expected to help the COE incorporate terrorist protection into all of its new construction projects.

In FY 1993 the ODCSINT prepared the land warfare chapter for "Joint Threat Environment Projection" and co-drafted the "Joint Strategic Review Dual-Use Technology Proliferation" paper. The findings from the latter were incorporated into the widely distributed National Military Strategy study. The ODCSINT also provided assessments for the BottomUp Review and the threat chapter and the intelligence and electronic warfare (IEW) annex in the Army Modernization Plan, which served as the planning document for the service's modernization programs. The IEW annex changed little from previous years and continued to call for critical systems such as the All Source Analysis System, the Guardrail Common Sensor, the Ground Based Common Sensor, the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), and the Ground Station Module.

In FY 1993 there were important developments in the Army's counterintelligence (CI) investigation of the Clyde Lee Conrad espionage ring.

Army CI agents arrested S. Sgt. Jeffrey S. Rondeau on 22 October 1992 after he confessed that in 1985 he had assisted the ring by reproducing classified documents. S. Sgt. Jeff E. Gregory, an infantryman with the 6th Infantry Division, was arrested in April 1993, also after confessing his involvement. The Army could not prosecute the two soldiers because the statute of limitations had expired under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but the cases were referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. Both were awaiting trial in Tampa, Florida, as the fiscal year ended.

During the fiscal year, in support of Presidential Review Directive 29, the ODCSINT helped provide input to a government task force seeking to draft a new executive order for classifying, declassifying, and safeguarding government national security information. These efforts came after some elected officials and interest groups sharply criticized the government's security programs for classifying too much information and not developing better guidelines for downgrading or declassifying documents. In the National Archives there was a declassification backlog of hundreds of millions of pages, and many post-Cold War security reformers called for declassification programs that accept risk management instead of risk avoidance.

In response to requests from the White House and the Senate and House Armed Services Committees during the fiscal year, the ODCSINT initiated an Army-wide search for information concerning domestic surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders during the 1950s and 1960s. In FY 1993 the ODCSINT also reviewed for public release information relating to the investigation of President Kennedy's death, in compliance with the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. The ODCSINT conducted the review during the fiscal year in coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In FY 1993 the ODCSINT Intelligence Directorate Reserve Affairs (IDRA) developed a new program to use reserve component military intelligence assets to assist during peacetime contingencies and crises, as well as during war. The new IDRA program utilized the Individual Mobilization Augmentation (IMA) Program to fill nearly 1,500 intelligence positions. Fiscal year 1993 was the first full fiscal year that the IMA programs at ODCSINT, INSCOM, and the Defense Intelligence Agency were all coordinated by the IDRA, making it one of the most active programs in the Army. In FY

1993 the IDRA also initiated the transfer of the Crazy Horse aerial electronic surveillance system, designed to collect communications intelligence, from the active Army to the Army Reserve. The 138th Military Intelligence Company (USAR) is scheduled to receive the Crazy Horse in FY 1995. Finally, the IDRA helped align linguistic ele-

70

ments of the 300th MI Brigade (Utah ARNG) to support the 701st MI Brigade. This was the first time that a specific reserve component linguist resource was dedicated to fill an echelon-above-corps language shortfall identified by the ODCSINT Language Requirements Study.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

In FY 1993 the Army National Guard's (ARNG) major combat force structure included 8 divisions (3 infantry, 3 mechanized infantry,1 light infantry, and 1 armored); 19 separate brigades (7 infantry, 6 mechanized infantry, 5 armored, and 1 light infantry); 2 armored cavalry regiments;2 special forces groups; 1 infantry group; 1 aviation brigade headquarters; 3 air defense artillery brigade headquarters; and 1 corps and 18 field artillery brigade headquarters. The ARNG provided a number of support units, such as headquarters for 3 medical brigades, 4 engineer brigades,3 military police brigades, 1 transportation brigade, 1 military intelligence brigade, and 1 chemical brigade. The National Guard also provided headquarters for both a signal and a support command.

During the fiscal year the ARNG responded to calls for increased unit readiness and created a strategy to deal with problem organizations. The Guard identified units that were chronically unable to meet the minimum personnel readiness standards and made these units primary candidates for force structure reductions. More than 72 Unit Status Reporting (USR) units were added to the ARNG force structure, but at the same time another 106 units were removed. With all Army components downsizing, the ARNG expected to lose approximately 58,000 positions to meet the target end strength established by the Army, but Congress intervened and reduced the ARNG force structure by only approximately 19,000 positions. The most significant force structure reorganizations resulted in the loss of two ARNG divisions. The 26th Infantry Division (Massachusetts ARNG) became the 26th Infantry Brigade, and the 50th Armored Division (New Jersey ARNG) became the 50th Brigade, 42d Infantry Division. The Guard used elements from the 26th Division that were not needed in the separate brigade to bring the 42d Infantry Division up to strength. Other Armywide modernization and reorganizations, such as the Engineer and Aviation restructure initiatives and Medical Force 2000, also continued to influence and shape units to help correlate ARNG force structure with active Army organization during the fiscal year.

Command and control of the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) was a long-standing problem until the creation of the U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) in 1990. USARC was designed to streamline the command of the Army Reserve by assuming many of the responsibilities previously exercised by FORSCOM's numbered continental armies. The Chief, Army Reserve (CAR), commanded the USARC, which was a subordinate command of Headquarters, FORSCOM. The CAR maintained a position on the HQDA staff as the CSA's principal adviser on the USAR but also served as the Deputy Commanding General, FORSCOM. The Army provisionally organized the USARC in October 1990 and gave the command a two-year test period, which it successfully completed during FY 1993. An independent commission chartered in December 1991 to examine the USARC issued its final report in October 1992, which the Secretary of the Army largely approved. He deferred making the USARC a MACOM and disapproved the proposal to make its commander a lieutenant general. Also during the year, the USARC headquarters moved from Fort McPherson, Georgia, to leased facilities near Atlanta's international airport.

Army-wide downsizing affected USAR strength and units during FY 1993. The Army inactivated 160 USAR units during the fiscal year, while those not inactivated were gradually scheduled to reorganize under modernized and more deployable Tables of Organization and Equipment (TOE). More than 700 unit reorganizations were programmed to convert the USAR force structure to the L-series TOEs. Even amid budget cutbacks, FY 1993 force structure changes resulted in the activation of more than sixty units to meet new mission requirements that were identified and assigned to the USAR to support the Total Army, and another 200 units were reorganized or converted to fill the need for specialized organizations. When the Secretary of Defense announced the 1993 plan for inactivating 830 reserve component units, there were six field artillery battalions on the list, but the inactivations were postponed for all but one

of these battalions. The 5th Battalion, 28th Field Artillery (8-inch, self-propelled), based at Cincinnati, Ohio, inactivated in September because the battalion's personnel and equipment were needed to convert the 3d Battalion, 92d Field Artillery (8-inch, self-propelled), to its new 24-gun configuration. To facilitate the transition, the 3d Battalion, 92d Field Artillery, which was headquartered in Akron, Ohio, relocated two firing batteries to Cincinnati.

## Strength and Personnel Management

In FY 1993 the Army National Guard included 358,149 soldiers, plus an additional 27,084 military technicians and 24,686 active Guard/Reserve personnel. The ARNG's programmed end strength of

422,725 consisted of 46,500 commissioned and warrant officers and 376,225 enlisted personnel. The Guard's actual end strength of 409,919, 97 percent of the objective, included 46,656 officers and 363,263 enlisted personnel. A lower number of enlisted accessions and an unexpected increase in enlisted losses accounted for the shortfall. ARNG planners sought to obtain 68,177 enlistments but by the end of the fiscal year had reached only 67,366, or 98.8 percent of the programmed accession objective. Enlisted losses exceeded anticipated projections by more than 13,000. The FY 1993 attrition rate of 21 percent created an enlisted loss of 83,700. Announced force structure reductions appeared to create much uncertainty within the eligible ranks. Many soldiers left the ARNG because they perceived a significant curtailment in their career and advancement opportunities. Officer end strength, although 156 higher than projected, still reflected a decrease of 968 positions from the previous fiscal year.

The percentage of minorities in the ARNG declined during the fiscal year, with 101,575 minorities forming 24.8 percent of the total strength. Continuing a trend that started in FY 1988, total African-American strength continued to decline. There were 64,379 African-American personnel, or 15.7 percent of assigned strength, in the ARNG in FY 1993- 2,203 personnel fewer than the previous fiscal year. The African-American guardsmen included 2,964 officers, who composed 6.4 percent of the officer strength, and 61,415 enlisted personnel, who composed 16.9 percent of the enlisted strength.

The percentage of females in the ARNG remained fairly stable during the fiscal year. The 31,386 females in the ARNG in FY 1993 comprised 7.7 percent of the ARNG's assigned end strength. There were 3,694 female officers, representing 7.9 percent of assigned end strength, and 27,692 enlisted personnel, representing 7.6 percent of assigned end strength.

The ARNG's Full-Time Support Program employs full-time personnel to support Guard programs and units. There were 24,686 active Guard/Reserve (AGR) personnel and 27,084 military technicians (MT) in the Full-time Support Program in FY 1993. During the fiscal year these full-time support positions were authorized at 66.5 percent of the workloadbased requirements. Congress decreased authorizations for AGR soldiers by 1,513 between FY 1991 and FY 1993 and in December 1991 established a hiring freeze, which continued through FY 1993, to meet the authorized levels. Many reduction programs, such as early retirement and other separation incentives, lacked appropriate funding, and the National Guard held a number of AGR job fairs to help cross-level the force by voluntarily transferring personnel from states with overstrengths to states that were below their AGR authorizations. The job fairs successfully attracted

230 personnel to move and helped downsize the force by the end of FY 1993. While the MT force decreased by 855 authorizations during the fiscal year, requirements for military technicians increased. This shortfall affected ARNG maintenance efforts already strained by the growing number of equipment modernization programs. In FY 1993 the number of MT authorizations as a percentage of requirements was 60.6 percent, and the number is expected to continue to decline during FY 1994.

U.S. Army Reserve AGR end strength in FY 1993 numbered 12,637 positions, down from 13,146 positions in FY 1992. The decline resulted from congressionally mandated reductions in USAR AGR authorizations. In determining which positions to eliminate, the Office of the Chief, Army Reserve (OCAR), solicited Army agencies and MACOMs utilizing USAR AGRs for input and established a program to prioritize all USAR AGR positions. The OCAR program outlined

the reductions and eliminated the authorizations-but not the position requirements-within various commands. There were 7,339 USAR AGR military techncians and 3,633 Department of the Army civilians (DAC) authorized by the end of FY 1993. Projections for FY 1994 predict a downward trend toward 7,159 authorized military technician positions and no predicted change to authorized DAC positions.

In FY 1993 the USAR end strength for the Selected Reserve (regularly drilled USAR members serving in troop program units and as Individual Mobilization Augmentees) was 279,615 personnel; for the Individual Ready Reserve (trained USAR personnel not assigned to troop program units but available to serve as reinforcements for units), 279,600 personnel; and for the Retired Reserve (primarily personnel receiving retirement pay after service with the armed forces), 599,965 personnel.

## Training and Readiness

In FY 1993 the Army expanded the BOLD SHIFT program, instituted in FY 1992 to address reserve component preand post-mobilization training problems at the level of the individual soldier, the leader, and the unit. The BOLD SHIFT initiatives involved streamlining U.S. Army Reserve, Army National Guard, and FORSCOM command schemes. Under BOLD SHIFT, active Army units develop associations with Contingency Force Pool (CFP) units and assist with reserve component training and evaluations. Reserve component soldiers are evaluated using the active Army's Operational Readiness Evaluation (ORE). The focus of maneuver unit training is on gunnery and crew/platoon proficiency. Combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) units focus on proficiency at the company level. The Army plans to use additional annual training and active duty training time for reserve component leaders to improve leadership and leader develop- ment initiatives. The Army also plans to fund full-time administrative personnel in high-priority USAR and ARNG units to help these units remain ready for deployments. In FY 1993 the Army expanded the BOLD SHIFT program to include all Roundout (RO), Roundup (RU), and CFP units. The ORE initiative also covered selected active component units. Although the Army wanted to institutionalize BOLD SHIFT methodologies for all reserve component units, scarce resources required that priorities be set for some initiatives for Enhanced Brigade and CFP units. The Army continued redistributing existing resources to fund BOLD SHIFT during the fiscal year. Projected BOLD SHIFT requirements for the FY 1994-99 POM were funded at 63 percent in FY 1993.

Under guidance contained in the FY 1993 National Defense Authorization Act, the Army must implement eighteen sections of Title XI, Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act (ANGCRRA) of 1992. During FY 1993 the Title XI Task Force fully or partially implemented twelve of the sections and developed programs for the remaining six. The task force will continue during the next fiscal year to develop plans to fund new and additional programs for the FY 1996-2001 POM. Provisions of the law specifically addressing the ARNG were written prior to the formation of the CFP and completion of the Bottom-Up Review and the Defense Planning Guidance. During the fiscal year the Army leadership applied the policy provisions of the law equally to the USAR and the ARNG and sought to prioritize resources for the early-deploying CFP units and for Enhanced Brigades.

Title XI of the FY 1993 DOD Authorization Act mandated training and readiness enhancements for all ARNG combat units. The Army planned to meet this requirement through BOLD SHIFT initiatives, more rigorous inspections and assessments, and expanded training of RO/RU units. The Army designated the ORE to meet the requirements of Title XI, Section 1122 (Inspections), for priority units in the CFP and the Enhanced Brigades. Closely linked to BOLD SHIFT and the Title XI training initiatives was FORSCOM's Total Army Training Study Ground Force Readiness Enhancement (GFRE). During the fiscal year FORSCOM planned to field the GFRE with six Regional Training Brigades and fifty-one Regional Training Battalions to conduct advanced tactical training under field conditions (lanes training) for ARNG and USAR units beginning in FY 1995. The plans call for USAR Divisions (Exercise) to supplement the GFRE for exercises supported by simulations and for selected CS and CSS lanes training events. The Army programmed full implementation through FY 1997.

The Army National Guard's Project STANDARD BEARER is part of the National Guard Bureau's deployability

enhancement program. The ARNG established Project STANDARD BEARER in November 1991 to support the Army's BOLD SHIFT Program. STANDARD BEARER aims to maintain C-1

(category 1, the highest standard) in personnel readiness for CFP and Enhanced Brigade units through increased recruiting and retention resources and implementation of a documented overstrength policy. In FY 1993 the deployability rate for CFP units in categories one through four was 97 percent, and the mission capability of these units continues to improve.

During the fiscal year the Operational Unit Program made the fifty-five earliest-deploying ARNG units in the CFP available for deployment in a volunteer federal status within seven days of an alert. This program, which is not contingent upon the President's Selected Reserve Callup authority, provides fully mission-capable units for short-notice contingency operations. The ARNG Overstructure Program deliberately authorized an overstrength of 15 to 20 percent in critical MOSs and skill levels to maintain 95 percent directed military overstrength in Enhanced Brigade and CFP units. During the fiscal year the Army adjusted authorization documents to add overstructure paragraphs to unit MTOEs through FY 1994.

STANDARD BEARER initiatives for later-deploying ARNG units include the Humanitarian Support Unit Program. The Guard developed this program in response to the Army Chief of Staff's request that as the active Army downsizes, the ARNG assume missions traditionally performed by active forces, including short-notice worldwide humanitarian missions. In FY 1993 the ARNG selected nineteen units from eighteen states for the Humanitarian Support Unit Program. These units were selected to support Humanitarian Support Unit Program missions in a volunteer status, within seventy-two hours of notification, for up to forty-five days. Units nominated but not selected are expected to be available for follow-on rotations if required.

In the Operational Integration Program (OIP), based on the Canadian Legion Model, ARNG volunteers can serve in an all-component Multinational Force and Observers Sinai Pilot Initiative. In FY 1993 OIP plans called for guardsmen from Maryland and Virginia's 29th Infantry Division (Light) to begin volunteering for an extended active duty tour with an active Army infantry battalion task force and then deploy to the Sinai peninsula. This task force is expected to form during the spring and summer of 1994 and continue training until it deploys to the Sinai in January 1995. ARNG volunteers are expected to form 75 percent of the battalion task force, including half of the leadership positions, and to serve a six-month active duty tour in the Sinai.

The Army introduced the Robust Test Unit Program to determine the effects of increased full-time manning and additional training man-days on readiness in selected later-deploying test units. In FY 1993, in conjunction with BOLD SHIFT, a Wisconsin ARNG armor battalion and a North Carolina ARNG mechanized battalion were selected to participate in the $1.5 million test of the concept. Preliminary data indicated promising results and no significant problems. The test is scheduled to conclude in May 1994, and OREs are expected to be administered to all units for comparison with the test units' ORE results from May 1993.

In FY 1993 the U.S. Army Reserve introduced the Priority Reserve Initiatives in Mobilization Enhancement (PRIME), also called USAR PRIME or Project PRIME, a deployability enhancement program. The PRIME is primarily used to provide mission-capable troop program units (TPU) and individual volunteers for short-notice Army contingencies. OCAR manages PRIME enhancements through the U.S. Army Reserve Command for CFP units and through U.S. Army Special Operations Command for Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF), Civil Affairs, and Psychological Operations units. PRIME provides CONUS-wide focus and centralized management to fix high-priority TPUs.

To attain the unit readiness levels required for contingency operations, the Army established a four-tier resourcing

system. Troop program units designated for early mobilization and deployment had priority resourcing. Tier 1 units were resourced at 100 percent of authorized equipment and full-time support and manned at 115 percent strength to ensure full directed military overstrength. PRIME's focus includes CFP, ARSOF, CA, and PSYOP units. Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) Terminal Transport, Deployment Control, and Railway Service units and Port Security Detachments were also intensively managed to ensure that they could support contingency deployments.

During FY 1993 the readiness levels of the TPUs managed by PRIME increased by 20 percent, and this trend is expected to continue into FY 1994. In addition, during the fiscal year the Army enhanced flexibility in manning fully mission-capable units by targeting Moss in the CFP for filling by the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). The Army Reserve Personnel Center (ARPERCEN) developed a program for the IRR to identify members as replacements or fillers to support contingency operations.

## Modernization

Downsizing in the active Army continued to benefit ARNG equipment modernization in FY 1993. Radios, maintenance kits, and tanks we re among the excess items that were no longer needed to supply the active component and could be transferred to Guard units. Guard roundup and roundout brigades continued to modernize and improve readiness with M1A1 Abrams tanks and HMMWVs. Following the Army's modernization schedule, ARNG aviation units received the UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache helicopters, and some mechanized infantry units acquired the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. Additional purchases under the congression- al Dedicated Procurement Program (DPP) eased equipment shortages in generators, forklifts, radios, night vision devices, and other items that affected ARNG operations and training. DPP helped the ARNG modernize faster than it would have had it depended solely on the Army's regular budget and procurement system. Modern equipment was in some cases lent back to the active component. The ARNG loaned equipment to the 10th Mountain Division for the Somalia humanitarian relief effort during Operation RESTORE HOPE. By the end of the fiscal year, 90 percent of the equipment loaned to the 10th Division had been returned to the ARNG.

In FY 1993 USAR equipment modernization included the 9-mm. pistol, the palletized loading system, the deployable medical systems (DEPMEDS) program, night vision devices, tug boats, wheeled vehicles, and SINCGARS. The USAR also received older Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and UH-60 and AH-64 helicopters. USAR mechanized forces were equipped with the M113A2 and M113A3 armored personnel carriers (APC) to operate as infantry and engineer squad carriers, medical evacuation carriers, and maintenance support vehicles and for other missions. In FY 1993 the USAR continued to convert M113A2 APCs to M113A3s to upgrade its assets. Congress directed the upgrades and modifications to increase the survivability of the APC. Upgrades included armored external fuel tanks, an upgraded engine and transmission to accommodate the added weight, and fixing points for bolt-on armor. Even with the upgrades, the M113A3 has limited mobility, firepower, and armor protection compared to the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which is programmed to replace the APCs in mechanized infantry units as soon as possible.

USAR modernization efforts in FY 1993 included reorganizing field artillery battalions equipped with 8-inch selfpropelled howitzers to increase the number of howitzers in each of the battalion's three firing batteries from four to eight. With eight howitzers in each battery, the new 3X8 organization increases the number of howitzers from twelve to twenty-four in each battalion. During the fiscal year the 8th Battalion, 40th Armor, received fifty-eight M1 Abrams tanks to replace its M60A3 main battle tanks. The 84th Division (Training) also received twenty Abrams tanks as part of its modernization. Other equipment upgrades included replacing three CH-47C helicopters with new CH-47D models; fielding new chemical agent monitors to five chemical decontamination units; and continuing delivery of six LCU 2000 utility landing craft to two heavy boat companies. The Army also made a commitment to modernize the 8th Battalion, 229th Aviation, an attack helicopter battalion, with eighteen AH-1F Cobras and to reequip the unit with eighteen AH-64 Apache helicopters sometime during FY 1994.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

The Louisiana Maneuvers facilitated the development of logistics initiatives to readily trace parts and equipment while in transit. In FY 1993 Army logisticians intended to use the Knowledge Based Logistics Planning Shell to develop ammunition and petroleum distribution plans. Other systems, such as Turbine Engine Diagnostics, which earned the 1993 American Defense Preparedness Association Logistics Artificial Intelligence Application Award, will help maintain the Army's readiness by applying artificial intelligence to detect problems in tank engines. During the fiscal year Army logisticians also worked on the Total Army Inventory Management program, which was designed to reduce the excess inventory of spare parts the service maintained to help it respond to unanticipated needs. As the Army's force structure decreased, so did its requirement for spare parts. The Army's goal was to maintain adequate stocks without adversely affecting readiness. New and existing automated systems were combined to create Total Asset Visibility, an attempt to improve materiel management throughout the life cycle of an equipment program or system. In FY 1993 Total Asset Visibility allowed managers to track 600 weapons systems and more than 210,000 products, repair parts, types of ammunition, and medical supplies that supported those systems and kept them ready.

During the fiscal year new business practices and logistics planning helped the Army reduce procurement costs. For example, the Army decreased its bureaucratic requirements and specifications and began challenging questionable vendor prices. More efficient distribution also helped reduce costs. One new business practice, the Single Stock Fund, will improve logistics and financial processes in the Army Working Capital Fund, Supply Management Army (AWCFSMA), business area. It will merge current wholesale and retail elements of the AWCF-SMA below departmental level into a single, nationally managed fund. Another initiative, the Objective Supply Capability, allows the Army to track supplies on a post or within a geographic area and allows customers to place orders on the wholesale supply in order to reduce time spent on complet- ing requisitions. During the fiscal year logisticians also changed the basis for war reserve stocks from support for a global war to sustaining two major regional contingencies and began relocating logistics resources to support probable operations.

Several other major logistics efforts in FY 1993 were devoted to increasing support for contingency operation deployments. The Army continued its Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), which allowed logisticians to contract for construction and some support services during deployments, thereby reserving vital strategic lift assets for other troops and equipment. LOGCAP also helped alleviate the impact of recent force structure cuts on logistics services. It was used successfully during Operation RESTORE HOPE. The Army sought to improve its overall costeffectiveness by contracting for these services on an as-needed basis instead of retaining the capabilities in its permanent force structure.

The Army adopted the Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI) as a framework to correct the structural design deficiencies of the Army of Excellence tables of organization and equipment, which were first published in 1985, and to modernize the Army's aviation fleet. ARI also sought new economies by reducing logistics requirements and keeping costs within the Army's shrinking resources. The DCSOPS designated the Commander, U.S. Army Aviation Center, at Fort Rucker, Alabama, as the executive agent responsible for implementing ARI and the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command (ATCOM) at St. Louis, Missouri, as the logistics planning agent. USAREUR and FORSCOM were the first MACOMs to adopt the ARI structure as their units prepare for conversion during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Both MACOMs established implementation teams to manage the ongoing inactivations and conversions to ensure a smooth transition

and to match ARI actions with the requirements of the Army's continued drawdown.

Several issues required resolution before ARI could be fully implemented. The TOEs for the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) companies and their parent battalions were slowly being developed and documented. The ARI plan as submitted to HQDA consolidated all UH-60s into a General Support Aviation Battalion, but ODCSLOG's Aviation Logistics Divison did not support the consolidation and wanted the utility aircraft restored to the AVIM companies (each AVIM company was authorized two UH-1Hs or UH-60s). MACOMs also expressed their desire to retain some displaced equipment, such as aviation special tools and test equipment, until all ARI requirements are documented.

In FY 1993 both ATCOM and the project managers worked to identify new locations for the equipment. The Army directed MACOMs to secure all aviation assets to ensure that they were not sent to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). Disposition instructions had to be distributed in time to eliminate excessive storage and maintenance expenses for displaced equipment. The Army also developed the Aircraft Retirement Action Plan to address major issues including funding, storage, transfer, safety, liability, and the impact on aviation industry sales. An HQDA Aircraft Retirement Conference is scheduled for FY 1994 to review the retirement program and to begin developing plans to rectify problems.

During the fiscal year the Army spent $227 million on the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP) to improve transportation infrastructure. The improvements included upgrading rail track, rebuilding bridges and roads, and constructing mobilization warehouses for contingency equipment and supplies. ASMP funds also allowed the continued development of important movement control systems and for specific ports to conduct Fast Sealift Ship (FSS) training. Other ASMP-funded projects reconstituted four ships in the Army Pre-Position (PREPO)Afloat Program, procured powered causeways and other watercraft enhancements, and continued upgrades for facilities and equipment that assist Army deployments. The Army programmed $367 million to continue and expand ASMP projects, such as container procurement and sealift deployment training exercises, for the next fiscal year.

During FY 1993 a significant achievement in producing the Army's FY 1996-2001 POM was the additional funding for the ASMP over the POM years, resulting in a total ASMP POM-funded program of $3.220 billion. Funding was added for railcar procurement, movement control, and watercraft enhancements. The additional funding was an acknowledgment of the critical role of strategic mobility in the post-Cold War Army, but there was still an unfunded requirement of $195 million programmed for CONUS infrastructure upgrades.

Strategic sealift made great progress in FY 1993. The Navy announced on 30 July the award of two contracts for the conversion of five container ships to the Large, Medium-Speed, Roll-On/Roll-Off (LMSR) configuration. After shipyards in Newport News, Virginia, and San Diego, California, complete the conversions, the LMSRs will help replace seven Ready Reserve Force (RRF) Roll-on/Roll-Off ships and one auxiliary crane ship that the Maritime Administration activated in July 1993 at the Army's request as part of the service's PREPO Afloat Program.

Until completion of the LMSRs, the Army plans to use the seven RRF ships as an interim measure to pre-position enough equipment and supplies (from inactivating units in Europe) to outfit a heavy brigade. Equipment loading is scheduled to begin in November 1993 in Rotterdam and is scheduled to be completed by May 1994. The Navy estimated that the five converted LMSRs would be ready for PREPO Afloat by December 1995, providing space for more than a million square feet of Army equipment. At least four new LMSRs are scheduled to be constructed under two Navy contracts, with each contract shipyard having the option to build five more LMSRs. Also, the Maritime Administration procured twelve additional RO/RO ships for the Ready Reserve Force during the fiscal year.

In FY 1993 the services and DOD continued planning, testing, and execution of the PREPO Afloat Program to support the immediate goal of deploying a heavy brigade in early FY 1994. In September 1993 the Deputy Secretary of Defense announced the selection of the Charleston Naval Weapons Station as the site for the PREPO Afloat Maintenance Facility. Sea Emergency Deployment Readiness Exercises began in FY 1993 and were highly regarded by participants. Strategic airlift benefited from the June delivery of the first C-17 to the first operational squadron stationed in Charleston, South Carolina. The Air Force plans to declare the unit operational no later than January 1995.

During the fiscal year the Army worked with the other services to help simplify logistics procedures and increase strategic mobility. The Army continued its participation in the Joint Intermodal Containerization Working Group, which was chaired by the U.S. Transportation Command. In support of the Joint Intermodal Containerization Master Action Plan, the Army worked to develop joint doctrine and policy and conducted a comprehensive review of Joint and Armyunique containerization doctrine, policies, and programs. The Army also refined its acquisition requirements for containers for the Equipment Deployment Storage System and for twenty-foot containers needed in unit deployments. The service also developed requirements for installation container and materiel handling equipment.

The nation's railways continued to constitute an important link in the Army's logistics system during FY 1993. When the Army's mechanized and armored divisions deploy overseas from their home stations (most of which are located some distance from the coast), much of the units' equipment and vehicles must be loaded onto trains and moved to the nearest port. In August 1993, under the Army Strategic Mobility Program, ATCOM contracted with a Canadian corporation, AMF, to supply the Army with 187 new rail flatcars at a cost of $13.8 million. Under the contract, AMF agreed to supply ninety-three 68-foot railcars and ninety-four 89-foot railcars, with delivery to begin during the third quarter of FY 1994. The new railcars are expected to be positioned at key deployment installations: Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Fort Hood, Texas. Using ASMP funding, the Army also replaced obsolete and unserviceable locomotives and bought boxcars for intra-installation ammunition movements.

In FY 1993 significant events in the Army watercraft program included progress in completing the Army Watercraft Master Plan (AWMP). The U.S. Army Transportation School continued work on the fourth iteration of the plan. The initial draft review was completed in December 1992. The Transportation School consolidated comments and is expected to continue to work on a revised AWMP draft.

The Army made continued headway in procuring watercraft assets in FY 1993. With a congressional appropriation of $18 million, the Aviation and Troop Command awarded a contract to Moss Point Marine Shipyard for the construction of a sixth Logistics Support Vessel (LSV). Construction of LSV-6 began in July 1993. During FY 1992 Derecktor, Inc., the company with the contract to build large tugboats for the Army, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Naval Sea Systems Command awarded a new contract to Trinity Marine, Inc., and a federal bankruptcy judge approved this action in September 1992. The new contract calls for completing and delivering six tugboats in fiscal years 199394. Contract problems affected the procurement of two modular causeway ferries during FY 1992. The contract needed an approved Operational Requirements Document, which TRADOC completed and approved. A contract was awarded to Lake Shore Inc. in December 1992, but another bidder filed a protest with the GAO and delayed further action. Settlement of the contract dispute is expected in FY 1994.

## Maintenance

During the fiscal year the Army continued the Refurbishment/Standardization (R/S) Program, which repaired and restored 300 of the oldest UH-60 helicopters to Army standards prior to redistributing them to Army Reserve and Army National Guard units. The Army expected to procure 300 UH-60Ls as part of the FY 1992-96 production buy. The R/S Program takes aircraft produced between 1977 and 1982 and standardizes the various modifications to the 1989 configuration. The older UH-60As marked for the R/S Program came out of "first to fight" priority units as the newer UH-60Ls began fielding. The program calls for sixty-eight aircraft to complete the program each year at Corpus Christi Army Depot in Texas and National Guard Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depots (AVCRAD) at Fresno,

California, and Groton, Connecticut. The R/S Program calls for the Corpus Christi depot to receive five aircraft into the program each month (sixty per year) and each of the AVCRADs to receive four per year. Refurbishment includes a 500hour phase airframe inspection, preventive maintenance, and replacement of all "time between overhaul" (TBO) items that have less than 500 service hours remaining. Standardization involves the application of more than thirty modifications and engineering changes. The first aircraft is scheduled to be refurbished in December 1993, and at least fifteen are expected to be completed by mid-1994. The average repair

85

cycle time is projected to be approximately six months, and the average cost per aircraft refurbishment is calculated at $1.536 million. The Army hopes to complete the refurbishment and standardization by FY 1997, barring significant cuts in depot maintenance funding.

In FY 1993 Congress directed the Secretary of the Army, in coordination with the Chief, National Guard Bureau, to identify the specific components of a UH-1 Huey Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). During the fiscal year the Army position was to procure new UH-60s in concert with the Army's modernization plan, which includes a strategy to replace older, more technologically obsolete aircraft with fewer but more capable systems. The Army's ultimate goal is to reduce the number, types, and models of rotary-wing aircraft, thereby cutting operating and support costs while maintaining an equivalent war-fighting capability. The objective is a rotary fleet consisting of the RAH-66 (for armed reconnaissance), AH-64 (attack), UH-60 (combat support), and CH-47 (combat service support). The ARNG supported an initiative for a SLEP UH-1 to perform the mission of a light utility helicopter until a new one was identified. The Army, however, did not believe that there was a proper requirement and opposed a UH-1 SLEP. The Army study on whether a UH-1 SLEP is required is expected to be completed by July 1994.

The Army established the Special Technical Inspection and Repair (STIR) Program to solve safety and readiness problems that aviation equipment developed during operations in Southwest Asia. Prolonged exposure to the high salt content and the very fine composition of the region's sand created problems for the helicopters' rotors, engines, and avionics and threatened to shorten their service lives. Due to a shortage of funds, only aircraft in the modernized aviation force (AH-64, UH-60, CH-47D, and OH-58D) were included in STIR. Using $439 million in Operation DESERT STORM finances, which expired on 30 September 1993, the program was originally funded to repair 911 aircraft, but additional funding is needed to complete this project. During the fiscal year plans called for STIR funding to continue using credits generated from the turn-in of depot-level reparables.

Four Army MACOMs (AMC, FORSCOM, SOCOM, and USAREUR) deployed aircraft to Somalia in FY 1993. At FORSCOM's request, ATCOM sent a team to Somalia in August 1993 to evaluate the effects of the environment on the deployed aircraft. The team confirmed that aircraft and components suffered extensive corrosion damage. Based on ATCOM's evaluation, FORSCOM, and later USAREUR, determined that a maintenance refurbishment program was needed to restore the aircraft to Army standards. Under the Somalia Aircraft Refurbishment Program (SARP), aircraft were returned to their home stations. There, ATCOM teams refurbished the aircraft at either the Installation Director of Logistics AVIM

facility or the unit's facility. The SARP included comprehensive and expanded inspection, cleaning, servicing, and corrosion treatment and prevention for each aircraft. When appropriate, outstanding modification work orders were carried out during the SARP to provide the most current aircraft configuration. FORSCOM and USAREUR provided centralized control, coordination, and funding for the program. FORSCOM estimated that it would cost $35.5 million to refurbish sixty-two aircraft, and USAREUR estimated a $2 million bill for six aircraft.

## Sustainability

Tactical water supply is critical to sustaining any operation, especially in the desert or in developing areas where potable water is scarce. DCSLOG, AMC, FORSCOM, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)

combined forces to improve sustainability for the many and varied elements of water support equipment that had been prone to problems in FY 1993. Within a few months the organizations reduced costs for critical consumable supplies by adding more suppliers and removing unnecessary packaging requirements. During the fiscal year the DCSLOG continued to reconstitute the Army's water operational project stocks, but significant deployments, such as Operation RESTORE HOPE, set back the reconstitution effort. Assets such as 150,000 gallon per day and 3,000 gallon per hour Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units (ROWPU) and the associated storage and distribution systems had to be restocked and remained a DCSLOG priority. The Army awarded a contract to Keco Industries on 30 December 1992 and successfully kept funds (starting in the FY 1995 budget) to purchase seventy-eight 3,000 gallon per hour ROWPUs. These additional units, however, would not meet the service's overall requirements. Through close coordination between DCSLOG, DCSOPS, FORSCOM, NGB, and CAR, the Army realigned the distribution of its tactical water supply assets with the current force packaging concept. This redistribution gave early-deploying units the capability to sustain the force and still provided other units with increased opportunities to train using ROWPU equipment. Coordination also produced agreements that would make FORSCOM's Salt Water Purification Training Site, located at Fort Story, Virginia, operational during the third quarter of FY 1994 and provide active Army and reserve component units the opportunity to train crews on salt water purification while they operate in a beach environment. This training site is expected to incorporate lessons from Operations DESERT SHIELD/STORM and RESTORE HOPE and is expected to help test new techniques and procedures.

In FY 1993 the Army adopted an initiative to standardize ground fuel. In September 1993 TRADOC and the Armor School agreed to use JP-8

87

as the single fuel for the battlefield. The Army had been using two redundant Army ground fuels, JP-8 and DF2, because of the Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS). VEESS using DF2 produced militarily ineffective smoke above 78 degrees Fahrenheit, and JP-8 was too clean to smoke. Under the new arrangement, combat vehicles such as the Abrams M1 main battle tank, Bradley M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle/M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle, M88 medium armored recovery vehicle, Combat Engineer Vehicle, and Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge will use an "under armor fog oil reservoir" that would feed into existing VEESS hardware. This modification would double smoke production and fit into the various mounted fleet system modernization programs. Standardizing JP-8 fuel ensured that DOD would embrace JP-8, which is safe and clean, as the standard fuel for land-based operations and greatly simplify petroleum supply and distribution.

The Force Provider program is intended to give the frontline soldier a brief but necessary respite from the rigors and dangers of combat. A Force Provider system contains all the material necessary to provide quality food service, billeting, laundry, shower and hygiene services, and morale, welfare, and recreation for 550 soldiers. Six Force Provider modules could be combined to support a brigade-size force. Improved soldier support systems such as Force Provider provide the Army with increased capabilities for force projection, theater reception, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and peace support operations.

During FY 1993 AMC and TRADOC completed substantial portions of the Force Provider program. The Army approved the operational requirements for Force Provider on 23 June 1993. Plans call for an evaluation to be conducted at Fort Bragg, followed by a Type Classification-Standard scheduled for May 1994. Procurement of the first Force Provider modules is expected to begin in FY 1995. The module used at Fort Bragg for the concept evaluation will remain on the post for use by the Force Provider company that is scheduled to activate there in FY 1994. The Army also substantially completed the first of two Interim Support Packages (ISP) to use until the state-of-the-art Force Provider modules are fielded. The ISPs are assembled from the Army's existing inventory and provide quality food, billeting, and laundry and improved hygiene for a brigade-size force. The first ISP was scheduled to be placed on the Army's expanded PREPO Afloat ships during the second quarter of FY 1994, and a second ISP was scheduled for completion and positioning at the Sierra Army Depot during the fourth quarter.

In addition to improving the living conditions of soldiers, the Army sought to improve the variety of its field rations. In the wake of the Persian Gulf War, the Armed Forces Chaplain Board requested development of a multifaith ration for

soldiers who had unique religious dietary require-

88

ments. The HQDA Subsistence Review Committee approved the request and developed nine Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), menus to meet special religious and dietary needs. Two multifaith MREs would be in each MRE box. Although any soldier could eat these rations, priority selection would go to those with special dietary requirements.

Soldiers frequently provided meals to hungry civilians while they deployed on one of the growing number of humanitarian assistance missions. During relief operations in Florida after Hurricane Andrew, and in Somalia and the Balkans, the Army used stocks of standard MREs to fill this need.

## Security Assistance

The Army's International Military Education and Training (IMET) Program grew from three countries in FY 1991 to twenty-one countries in FY 1993, as nations from Eastern Europe, Albania, and the Commonwealth of Independent States received new assistance totaling approximately 21 percent of the IMET allocation. Technology transfer issues continued to be an important concern during the fiscal year. The declining budget forced the Army to put more emphasis on affordability and to consider how growing international sales of weapon systems would affect the United States' shrinking defense industrial base. American vendors faced a sharp increase in foreign competition in international markets as the former Soviet Union and some old Warsaw Pact allies made a concerted effort to flood the available market with cheaper and less advanced weapons. Key technology transfer issues during the fiscal year included the release of Third Generation Night Vision Technology, Advanced Tank Ammunition, and the transfer of 120-mm. smooth-bore cannon technology to the Republic of Korea.

The Army also improved regional security in FY 1993 by helping other nations develop their judicial systems. During the fiscal year Army lawyers participated in military-to-military programs with emerging democracies throughout the world. These programs ranged from information exchanges to assisting the host nation's military to institutionalize concepts such as human rights training, civilian control of the military, and fair and effective military justice systems. In Moldova, for example, Army lawyers assisted in drafting legislation to establish a volunteer military. In Peru, Army judge advocates assisted the Peruvians with developing a program to institutionalize human rights training for the military and national police. This effort resulted in the publication of a handbook entitled "The Ten Commandments of Human Rights," which was adopted as the primary human rights training manual for Peru's security forces and used to instruct more than 56,000 Peruvian soldiers.

89

The Judge Advocates General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps signed a memorandum of understanding in May 1993 to streamline the provision of legal training services to foreign countries. Under its provisions, an Inter-Service Committee on International Legal Education was established to act as a "single reception point for proposals and requests for educational exchanges and programs." During the fiscal year the committee worked at creating a database to preserve teaching materials and lessons learned from its activities.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

Army spending on research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) increased slightly during FY 1993 to nearly $7.7 billion, compared with $7.4 billion the prior fiscal year. FY 1993 RDTE projects included integrating Longbow missile and fire control systems into Apache AH-64 attack helicopters and continuing development of the Comanche RAH-66 armed reconnaissance helicopter. The Army also funded continued development of the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS) and the Future Armored Resupply Vehicle. The RDTE budget fully supported all the Army Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Science and Technology Objectives under the DOD Science and Technology Thrust Program.

In November 1992 the Army issued the FY 1993 edition of the Army Science and Technology Master Plan (ASTMP). The ASTMP was the fourth in the series (earlier editions were entitled Army Technology Base Master Plan). ASTMP links DOD technology planning and the technology plans of the Army's individual major commands, major subordinate commands, and laboratories. The plan laid out the strategic blueprint for the Army's Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program through two hundred Science and Technology Objectives. Each objective contained a description of a specific, measurable, major technology advancement to be achieved by a certain fiscal year. New to the FY 1993 ASTMP were TRADOC's post-Cold War doctrinal concept of Battlefield Dynamics and the establishment of six Battle Labs as a means of developing capabilities for a force-projection Army. The Battle Labs are expected to refine requirements and permit examination of emerging doctrine, training, leader development, organizations, and materiel. The labs are expected to have close ties with industry and with each other through an advanced distributed interactive simulation network.

During FY 1993 the Army Science Board (ASB) conducted forty panel meetings in support of its study efforts and issued three reports: "Command and Control on the Move ," "Land Warfare Combat

90

Identification," and "Research, Development and Engineering Centers, Army Materiel Command." The ASB, a federal advisory committee organized under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, serves as the Army's senior scientific advisory body. It makes recommendations to the Secretary of the Army; the Chief of Staff of the Army; the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition; the Army Staff; and major Army commanders on scientific and technological matters of concern to the Army. At the end of FY 1993 four ASB reports were pending publication: "Innovative Acquisition Strategies for the '90s," "Missile Defense Programs," "System for Soliciting and Processing New Ideas/Concepts/Technologies," and "Technology for the Future Land Warrior."

During FY 1993 the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST) continued advising the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology by designing, conducting, and supervising the National Research Council's Army-related studies of scientific and technological issues. This work was accomplished through member meetings, study groups, and standing committees that examine specific issues and narrowly focused topics. During FY 1993 BAST held one meeting on each of the following topics: DOD simulations, information warfare (peacekeeping), and information warfare (Advanced Technology Demonstrations and Advanced War-fighting Demonstrations), respectively. Four BAST committees were active during FY 1993: Strategic Technologies for the Army; Alternative Futures for the Army Research Laboratory;Alternative Chemical Demilitarization Technologies; and Review and Evaluation of the Army Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program (also called the Stockpile Committee).

The Army completed five Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATD) in FY 1993. These included AirLand Battle Management (ALBM), Soldier Integrated Protective Ensemble (SIPE), Advanced Air Defense Electro-Optical System (AADEOS), Multi-Role Survivable Radar (MRSR), and Component Advanced Technology Testbed (CATTB). The ATDs were risk-reducing, integrated exhibitions conducted in an operational or simulated environment rather than in a laboratory. They are expected to assist materiel developers and the Army in assessing operational capability, technological maturity, and cost effectiveness.

The ALBM ATD demonstrated advanced computer planning and battle-monitoring decision aids that reduce operational and tactical planning times and allow decisions to be made well ahead of the enemy's decisions. Automated reasoning capabilities and supervisory tools for the commander and staff managed large volumes of data that had to be processed and analyzed to yield combat decisions. Key to this ATD was the integration of artificial intelligence, simulation modeling, soldier-machine interface, and dis- tributed database technologies. Results of this ATD supported Army modernization objectives to win an information war using systems that included the All Source Analysis System and the Maneuver Control System.

The SIPE ATD demonstrated that a modular, head-to-toe, individual fighting system will greatly increase soldier combat effectiveness. The concept of providing the soldier with an Integrated Headgear Subsystem, an Advanced Clothing Subsystem, a Microclimate Conditioning/Power Subsystem, and a Soldier's Computer proved to be feasible and very effective, providing dismounted soldiers with a technological advantage over potential adversaries. Some specific enhanced capabilities included improved target detection at night, even through obscurants or when wearing NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) gear; improved target engagement, especially at night; ability to engage unexposed targets; improved command and control within a squad (soldier communications, data, and video transmissions); and the interoperability and modularity of equipment. The ATD identified areas that require further technological advances and provided a good baseline for the Generation II Soldier ATD and the Land Warrior development program.

The AADEOS ATD demonstrated an automatic search and track capability to detect helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in atmospheric or terrain clutter at ranges commensurate with Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) engagement requirements. The technologies demonstrated included dual band infrared focal plane arrays, intrascan clutter rejection/ target detection algorithms, wide field of view coverage, advanced infrared optics, and automatic target acquisition and tracking.

The MRSR ATD demonstrated a multifunction, track-while-scanning, continuous-wave radar capable of operating in the presence of antiradiation missiles and electronic countermeasures. The MRSR is a mobile sensor in a single vehicle configuration capable of supporting FAAD, corps, and theater air defense systems in contingency operations.

The CATTB ATD demonstrated the feasibility of integrating advanced vehicle components and subsystems, such as integrated propulsion, external suspension, more durable track, and standard Army electronics architecture on a combat vehicle testbed (modified Abrams tank chassis). The ATD successfully examined CATTB's integration of lethality, mobility, and durability features. The testbed spotlighted the latest in propulsion, track, suspension, fire suppression, electronics, and NBC protection technologies. It demonstrated the Army's capability to meet its needs through the application of integration techniques and generated the foundation for the development of the digital electronic battlefield to facilitate future Army operations.

Advanced composites, because of their high strength and light weight, are the potential candidate materials for the Army's High Technology

92

Light Division (HTLD) equipment, battlefield shelters, bridging, and numerous aerospace applications. Composites using recycled materials also are candidates for many Corps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration infrastructure construction projects. The long-term service life of many of these materials in below-freezing environments, especially under high-strain-rate loading, is largely unknown. Low-temperature-induced brittleness in some materials can cause catastrophic failure. To analyze composites at low temperatures, in FY 1993 engineers began a comprehensive testing program to evaluate the civil and military applications of composite materials at these cold temperatures. Data from these tests are expected to provide design input for fabricating structures for cold environments.

Seismic and acoustic waves are effective for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) surveillance and targeting by smart weapons sensors but are greatly affected by ground conditions, especially in cold regions. During FY 1993 Army researchers conducted a theoretical comparison of acoustic wave propagation in porous media with different pore fluids. The comparison demonstrated that the energy transfer of a wave to a water-filled medium was only slightly frequencydependent, whereas in an air-filled sand medium it was highly frequency-dependent. These results justified modeling air-filled soil and snow as a modified fluid. This approach was commonly used to model saturated undersea sediments and provided the foundation for understanding the impact of snow cover on acoustic propagation relevant to the changes in the performance of smart weapons sensors, such as the Wide Area Mine, operated in a winter environment.

In FY 1993 tactical Army commanders gained an unprecedented ability to display and exploit knowledge of the digitized battlefield with a demonstration of AirLand Battlefield Environment (ALBE) software. The demonstration,

conducted in Germany, allowed soldiers to evaluate the impact of terrain and weather on various military functions, such as planning, command and control, and logistics. When combined with digital maps or reconnaissance imagery, the software enabled commanders to visualize the battlefield in a three-dimensional perspective, plan avenues of approach, identify limitations to mobility, find likely minefield sites, and perform many other functions critical to combat operations. Following the ALBE tests, the U.S. Army Engineer School recommended fielding the ALBE software to troop units. The software operates in a garrison environment using commercial 486-microprocesser personal computers and on several military computer systems. Ten terrain teams in Germany and several topographic elements in Korea had ALBE installed on their computers and received appropriate training by the end of the fiscal year.

In April 1993 the Army type-classified the Digital Topographic Support System (DTSS). Developed for the Program Executive

Office-Command and Control Systems, DTSS is expected to provide tactical terrain analysts with the ability to create, update, and manipulate digital tactical terrain data and eventually to support all Army Tactical Command and Control Systems. The intent is to give commanders an advantage in obtaining up-to-date information about the battlefield environment much faster than current capabilities permit. Upon achieving type classification, the DTSS entered into the production phase of the Army's materiel acquisition process. Successfully completed software Preproduction Qualification Testing resulted in the release of the DTSS software. This software, which became the baseline for the first series of preplanned product improvements, was installed on the two DTSS-prototype (non-shelter configured) systems located at the 555th Engineer Company and 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas.

During FY 1993 DTSS personnel provided crisis support to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) by reformatting Defense Mapping Agency-generated Digital Topographic Elevation Data and Interim Terrain Data. This effort supported ongoing DIA activities in Bosnia. In addition, DTSS personnel loaded these data on the 555th Engineer Company's and 1st Cavalry Division's DTSS prototypes. Coordination with FORSCOM resulted in finalization of the DTSS Materiel Fielding Plan. FORSCOM became the first major command to field DTSS and scheduled the first fielding of DTSS (with the 555th Engineer and 1st Cavalry) for March 1994.

In FY 1993 the Corps of Engineers conducted Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP) tests to develop standoff demolition techniques using military applications against bridges, walls, and bunkers. The EFP test results led to improvements in shaped-charge slug cohesion and terminal velocity that exceeded Corps of Engineers objectives. The Army scheduled the EFP for fielding in FY 1996.

During FY 1993 the Army developed a new revetment unit to meet the requirement for a highly stable revetment with a simple and easily moldable design. The new unit, ELBLOC, is expected to greatly aid in the protection of shorelines and water way embankments. The ELBLOC consists of combined units that form a matrix with sufficient porosity to allow drainage and pr event excessive water pressure under the units. Another development in FY 1993, CORE-LOC, which can be placed on steep or shallow slopes, provided improved concrete units for protecting coastal structures.

In FY 1993 the Construction Productivity Advancement Research (CPAR) program opened an avenue for cost-shared research between industry and the Corps of Engineers to improve productivity in the U.S. construction industry. Participation in the CPAR program was open to any nonfederal entity, including state and local governments, colleges and universities, corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and trade asso- ciations. CPAR focused on the functional areas of planning and design improvement, improved construction site productivity, and advanced materials. During the fiscal year significant CPAR program advances were made in trenchless technology for pipeline rehabilitation, the use of rubber as an aggregate in asphalt paving, and effective antifreeze admixture to allow placement of concrete at below-freezing temperatures.

In FY 1993 the Dredging Research Program designed a new drag head for use by hopper dredges, developed a new comprehensive management technique for dredging operations, and developed a dredge navigation system for positioning and surveying that employs Global Positioning System technology accurate to within a decimeter (4 inches). These innovations significantly increased dredging efficiency and reduced operating costs.

During FY 1993 the Repair, Evaluation, Maintenance, and Rehabilitation Research Program issued guidance on using rapid-setting repair materials for concrete structures and using nonlinear pulse-echo systems for nondestructive testing of concrete. The program also issued guidance on optimizing solutions to machinery icing problems when major rehabilitations are planned and on maintenance and repair alternatives to pr event recurring problems with coating failures for metal structures.

In FY 1993 the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Pilot Program issued a report recommending pursuit of magnetic levitation transportation development. The report recommended continuation of federally supported research on specific problems that had arisen and postponement of the demonstration phase of the program.

The Army continued to modernize the force during the fiscal year, despite the continued decline in funding for procurement. Expenditures for procurement totaled $11.8 billion in FY 1993, compared with $12.5 billion in FY 1992 and $16.1 billion in FY 1991, representing a 27 percent decrease over two fiscal years.

The Army funded the production of 43 M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 87 M119 light howitzers, and 242 120-mm. mortars and financed modification programs for Bradley Fighting Vehicle and Abrams Tank Ammunition Support Vehicles. Procurement funding included the beginning of a four-year upgrade program to reconfigure M109 155-mm. self-propelled howitzers to the M109A6 Paladin version. Other procurements included 144 Avenger short-range air defense systems and 44 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). To improve the antitank capabilities of its light infantry forces, the Army began low-rate initial production of the Javelin antitank missile system. The TOW missile continued to furnish Army ground forces with a long-range antitank capability. More than 8,000 TOW IIB missiles were purchased during the fiscal year. To provide fire support capable of striking deep into the enemy's rear, the

Army purchased 351 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles. Army aviation benefited from the procurement of fifty-two Black Hawk UH-60 utility helicopters and sixty-three newly adopted TH-67A Creek training helicopters. The Army extended programs to field the Chinook CH-47D transport helicopter and to retrofit thirty-six Kiowa OH-58 helicopters to the OH-58D armed version.

Continued funding and procurement of the Family of Medium and Tactical Vehicles, the Palletized Loading System, and the HMMWV ensured that the Army would carry on with efforts to improve its logistics and transportation capabilities. The Army purchased equipment to improve its leading command, control, and communications abilities by funding modernization of the Defense Satellite Communications Systems, the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, and the Single Channel Objective Tactical Terminal.

The Integrated Helmet and Display Sight System is a Class VII accountable item that has been treated by aviators as individual equipment since 1986 under a special HQDA authorization. The permission to do so was granted because organizations needed special kits to fit and align the helmets, and the kits were not available. Since then the kits have been fielded to all Apache (AH-64) attack helicopter units. In 1992 the Army Audit Agency reported that the special accountability procedures authorized in 1986 were ineffective and not being followed. The Army had lost accountability of 379 helmets, and it decided in FY 1993 to terminate the 1986 regulatory exception and begin accountability procedures during FY 1994.

At the end of World War II the Army had had so much equipment stockpiled in Europe that it granted authority for local disposal of the surplus stocks. The rapid drawdown of Army troops in Europe after the Cold War created a similar problem, leaving USAREUR with massive stockpiles of ammunition and equipment far in excess of its needs. Using modern automation and communications, the Army determined that it could maintain an accurate inventory of the material and avoid local disposal. The Army established a program entitled RETROEUR (Retrograde of Material from

Europe) to ensure stewardship of the valuable material during the continued force reductions and to return ammunition and vehicles from USAREUR to CONUS for refurbishment and redistribution throughout the Army. A Vice Chief of Staff directive for ODCSLOG led to the creation of the RETROEUR Task Force in November 1992. The task force functioned as the point of contact for issues and actions related to the retrograde of supplies and equipment from Europe and synchronized and coordinated all actions between CONUS and MACOMs outside CONUS required to accomplish the mission.

By July 1993 USAREUR had identified 55,000 excess vehicles for redistribution or disposal. Of these, nearly 2,000 would stay in Europe to

96

fill in-theater requirements and 11,000 would eventually accompany units leaving Europe for restationing in CONUS. Two active Army repair facilities, together with National Guard and Army Reserve facilities, repaired and refurbished vehicles to Army standards prior to redistribution. Of the 11,000 vehicles identified for return to CONUS, approximately 3,400 were retrograded in FY 1993, and 7,600 were scheduled for return during the next fiscal year to complete the vehicle retrograde program. The balance of excess USAREUR vehicles is expected to be redistributed through Foreign Military Sales, the NATO Equipment Transfer Program, the United Nations, or the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office.

Ammunition retrograde was also successful in FY 1993. USAREUR shipped 137,000 tons of ammunition during the fiscal year and had funding to ship 110,000 tons in FY 1994. Ammunition retrograde remained on schedule and is expected to be completed in FY 1995 with the return of the remaining balance of 73,000 tons. In FY 1993 the RETROEUR Task Force helped reestablish the Lexington Bluegrass Army Depot, which had formerly been an active depot in Kentucky, to receive excess Class II and Class VII nonrolling stock retrograded from USAREUR. The Kentucky National Guard is scheduled to operate the depot, expected to be operational in FY 1994. The facility is to act as a clearinghouse to redistribute Class II and VII equipment items to fill shortages throughout the Army.

## Support Services

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Congressional and DOD guidance to improve oversight of the use of nonappropriated funds (NAF) for morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) resulted in the establishment of an MWR Board of Directors (BOD) during the fiscal year. Responsible to the Secretary of the Army, the BOD exercised oversight of NA F, including strategies to invest the funds, and reviewed MWR operations and family programs. The board also developed long-term resource strategies and operational initiatives and emphasized accountability and stewardship of both appropriated and NAF programs. Scheduled to meet biannually, the BOD consists of the four-star MACOM commanders and the USARPAC commander and is supported by an executive committee chaired by the DCSPER. Other committee members include MACOM chiefs of staff, the Chief of Engineers, the ACSIM, the Sergeant Major of the Army, a representative from a small MACOM, and a representative of retirees. Three functional committees-strategic planning, finance, and audit-support the executive committee.

During the fiscal year the Board of Directors provided leadership and sound business insight for MWR programs, helping the Army drive down excessive overhead costs in NAF programs. The board also furnished consistent guidance to the field, centralized control of major NAF construction projects, and introduced new management standards into MWR programs. These initiatives included a Nonappropriated Fund Management Trainee Program to help build a trained and motivated MWR workforce and a standardized patron survey program to highlight customer desires and identify deficiencies in MWR programs and facilities. In response to the increased number of overseas military operations, the Board of Directors designated MWR as mission-essential for deploying forces and created deployable civilian recreation specialists. The board also provided commanders with clear and specific objectives in meeting the newly created operational and financial standards for MWR programs.

99

In FY 1993 the Army Family Action Plan annual conference determined that retention of commissary benefits, erosion of health care benefits, stateside cost of living allowances, equitable child-care fees for low income soldiers, and transfer of GI Bill benefits were the most critical quality-of-life issues facing the Army. Conference delegates reviewed eightysix issues relating to benefits erosion, downsizing and transition, reserve component mobilization, family support, entitlements, employment opportunities and benefits, medical concerns, and youth education. The delegates set priorities for and sent to the CSA twenty-six issues for DOD and Army Staff action.

## Food Service

Army troop reductions and facility consolidations reduced the number of worldwide dining facilities at the end of the fiscal year to 475, a decline of 119 facilities from FY 1992. By the end of FY 1993, the Army completed fielding of the Army's Food Management Information System (AFMIS) at forty-three installations, resulting in reductions in food service personnel. AFMIS automates subsistence requisitioning, inventory management, food production, and food adviser management reports. The planned evaluation of a multimedia, multifunctional identification card for automating dining facilities headcount data during the fiscal year was postponed until the final quarter of FY 1994.

During FY 1993 the Army tested and evaluated an � la carte meal service for the troop dining facilities at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The � la carte meal service priced each menu item individually, making point-of-sale cash registers an integral part of this type of meal service. The Army's interest in an � la carte food service, a private sector business practice, grew as Army hospitals successfully implemented the new method during ongoing experiments. In adopting more private sector business practices to reduce subsistence expenses, the Army joined the other services and the

Defense Logistics Agency in planning a demonstration, scheduled for FY 1995, of commercial vendor distribution of subsistence items directly to the dining facilities.

## Health and Medical

The Army Medical Department (AMEDD) faced a period of great change in FY 1993. Troop downsizing and base closures affected TOE medical units at CONUS installations, such as Fort Ord's 8th Evacuation Hospital, which was inactivated in September. In Europe, the AMEDD changed to support a much smaller force structure that was scheduled to decline to about 65,000 troops and their families. The AMEDD closed

100

many of USAREUR's local medical activities and clinics and inactivated many hospitals that had operated in Europe for decades. Some hospitals were replaced with combat support hospitals that were designed to be more mobile and deployable, two important features in USAREUR's post-Cold War outlook. In addition to the turbulence of downsizing, the AMEDD was in the midst of Medical Force 2000 (MF2K), a reorganization developed to restructure field medical support and correct the mobility and other problems experienced during the Persian Gulf War.

During the fiscal year medical planners were concerned about the mobility of the sixty-bed mobile Army surgical hospitals (MASH) in the force structure. Beginning in late FY 1992, AMEDD tested the thirty-bed MASH and examined its mobility and medical capabilities. Evaluation reports issued in June 1993 found problems with the thirtybed concept. In September the commander of the AMEDD Center and School recommended to the Army's Surgeon General that forward surgical teams (FST), small, highly mobile units that could perform surgery close to the front, replace MASHs in the force structure, based on the conclusion that this change was necessary to support the new powerprojection Army.

The AMEDD also decided to reduce the number and variety of its TOE hospitals. In December 1992, as part of its move to eliminate large evacuation hospitals from the force structure, Fort Hood's 21st Evacuation Hospital was officially reorganized and redesignated as the 21st Combat Support Hospital, matching the similar activations of combat support hospitals in Europe during the fiscal year. As part of AMEDD's ongoing effort to improve the mobility and deployability of its TOE hospitals, the department began another study to test the capabilities of the MF2K combat support hospital. The AMEDD selected the 10th Surgical Hospital, Fort Carson, Colorado, for evaluation. During the first quarter of FY 1993, the Army reorganized and redesignated the unit as the 10th Combat Support Hospital. The multiyear study was scheduled to last until 1995 and would test the unit's mobility and clinical abilities through a series of exercises and evaluations.

In FY 1993 the Army continued to implement the BRAC process that mandated realigning three medical research and development facilities from the Letterman Army Institute of Research (LAIR), located at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. During the fiscal year the LAIR Blood Research Division, located with the Naval Medical Research Institute at the Gillette Building in Rockville, Maryland, became a detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Washington, D.C. The LAIR Military Trauma Research facility was realigned with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The LAIR Ocular Hazards Research facility relocated to Brooks Air Force Base, Texas. During the fiscal year BRAC also closed

101

the Institute of Dental Research, which became a detachment under WRAIR.

Investigators at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease, Fort Detrick, Maryland, participated in the isolation and identification of the etiologic agent responsible for the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome that initially occurred in young Navajo Indians in the southwestern United States. The Army contributed to the national effort to counter this public health threat by maintaining a surveillance program. During the fiscal year institute scientists also completed safety and efficacy trials in animals of a candidate Korean Hemorrhagic Fever vaccine and received

regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials of the vaccine in human volunteers.

In FY 1993 Army investigators from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and its overseas laboratories initiated a large-scale field trial of a vaccine directed against falciparum malaria, the most lethal form of malaria. The original test population numbered more than 1,200 volunteers from Burmese refugee camps in the northwest corner of Thailand. A preliminary test of the antibiotic azithromycin demonstrated that it protected 75 percent of the volunteers from infection when exposed to falciparum malaria. More extensive clinical trials are planned to satisfy the safety and efficacy requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for product licensure.

During the fiscal year the Army developed a three-week suspended release formulation for a microencapsulated cephazolin antibiotic. The Army expects that the development of biodegradable microencapsulated antibiotics will help control debilitating osteomyelitis (bone infection) resulting from combat wounds, in addition to improving the quality of life for injured soldiers and reducing care costs. Further studies are expected to be performed to develop formulations that provide four- to six-week release of cephazolin and tobramycin antibiotics and to demonstrate their efficacy and safety in animals. These products are expected to be developed as a complement to microencapsulated ampicillin, which is currently in development.

Botulinum toxin is a lethal toxic protein substance. During FY 1993 laboratories of the U.S. Army Medical Research, Development, Acquisition, and Logistics Command (Provisional) utilized biotechnology to produce a nontoxic, new generation botulinum toxin vaccine, since the present vaccine, which is in short supply, is manufactured using old technology. The genetically engineered products are expected to be absolutely safe, since they are nontoxic, unlike the current vaccine, which is made from a lethal toxin inactivated by chemical means. Indications are that gene products would be more effective than the inactivated toxin. Preliminary studies in animals showed that the cloned product was effec-

## 102

tive in preventing illness and death from two types of toxin. The new vaccine is expected to be much less costly to prepare, since it is made from nontoxic material and does not require special facilities for production.

Fibrin, a protein in blood plasma, is formulated to be used as a hemostatic agent to stop the flow of blood. Severe blood loss is a major cause of death on the battlefield, and fibrin glues offer an opportunity to prevent a significant number of deaths. Fibrin glues have the potential to be used by soldiers to improve the control of extremity bleeding for wounded awaiting evacuation from a forward portion of the battlefield to medical treatment facilities. During FY 1993 the Army developed a model for uncontrolled extremity hemorrhage and used the model to conduct proof-of-concept testing for fibrin glues as local hemostatic agents. The model is expected to be used as a reference tool for other studies of resuscitation.

Toxic conditions resulting from local infections are a major complication of burn wounds and can also lead to incapacitation and evacuation of soldiers after relatively minor trauma. Improved wound dressings have the potential to reduce hospital costs, improve patients' quality of life, and keep soldiers on the battlefield. Silver nylon dressings have been demonstrated to promote healing of donor site wounds and provide greater patient comfort. In FY 1993 the Army planned further development of silver nylon dressings for burn care and continued to explore the potential of silver nylon for treatment of ballistics wounds.

In FY 1993 the Army continued production of experimental batches of stroma free hemoglobin (remains of red blood cell membranes) in searching for a blood substitute that would allow oxygen-carrying resuscitation fluids to be administered where logistics considerations largely preclude the use of fresh or freeze-thawed refrigerated blood products. Army hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying pigment of red blood cells) production permits investigations of the efficacy and toxicity of candidate blood substitutes by independent academic researchers unhindered by restrictions on information exchange that have been imposed by commercial blood substitute developers. The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration deemed such investigations crucial to ensuring that issues of safety and efficacy with these products are comprehensively addressed in a timely manner. The Army's stroma free hemoglobin is expected to be provided to qualified academic researchers with proposals relevant to Army requirements as well as to

U.S. Navy investigators to facilitate their efforts in developing an alternative blood substitute material.

Army efforts directed at chemical defense made significant advances during the fiscal year. Army researchers identified a new approach to reducing nerve agent casualties through the use of bioengineered scavenger molecules based on naturally occurring enzymes. Researchers

## 103

demonstrated protection against nerve agents using scavengers. In vivo protection against the nerve agent Soman was demonstrated following administration of three naturally occurring enzymes-carboxylesterase, cholinesterase, and somanase. The Army expects that this approach may lead to the development of exogenous enzyme-based scavengers effective against nerve agent exposure. Scientists also developed methods, expected to be adopted in several years, for detecting chemical warfare agents in samples taken from casualties.

Researchers made substantial progress in developing medical countermeasures against vesicant (blistering) agents. Army researchers completed work on a pretreatment against expected battlefield concentrations of cyanide. The Army performed toxicity and efficacy assessments of two pretreatments for cyanide methemoglobin formers (the agents that cause the body to form methemoglobin). These pretreatments are expected to be relatively free of undesirable effects on soldiers' performance.

Researchers mutated human enzymes to probe for active sites of nerve agents. Specific site-directed mutations of human enzymes attacked by nerve agents were produced to probe for the active site of inhibition by these agents. The goal of this research is to develop catalytic enzymes that will destroy nerve agents without being inactivated themselves.

Army researchers identified bacterial strains in soil that could metabolize nerve agents and may enable development of versatile decontaminants. Researchers determined that inhibitors of the enzyme PADPRP, which occurs in skin, protected against some effects of the vesicant chemical warfare (CW) agent sulfur mustard. This research may lead to an effective sulfur mustard countermeasure to prevent blister formation.

Researchers developed analytical methods for the detection of the vesicant agents sulfur mustard and lewisite; the G series nerve agents Soman, Sarin, and Tabun; and the nerve agent VX in biological samples. These methods may lead to field procedures for diagnostic, prognostic, and verification situations involving these chemical agents.

Army Unit Resiliency Analysis modeling demonstrated the impact on unit effectiveness of currently fielded medical countermeasures against nerve agents. Tested countermeasures included the anticholinergic atropine, the oxime 2-PAM, and the nerve agent pretreatment pyridostigmine. The modeling procedure indicated that major improvements in unit effectiveness are expected to result from fielding the next generation of medical countermeasures against CW agents, including Topical Skin Protectant, a barrier against CW agents, and the improved oxime HI-6.

The Army development of a topical skin protectant passed its first milestone of the in-process review and entered the demonstration and validation phase of development. This product is expected to significantly

## 104

enhance the protection afforded by the current chemical protective ensemble by providing a nonirritating skin barrier against CW agents.

The Army continued development of the Nerve Agent Antidote System, HI-6, the next-generation oxime for use on nerve agent casualties. Preclinical toxicology, efficacy, and mutagenicity studies were conducted.

The Army held a Source Selection Board for the Multichambered Autoinjector. This product is expected to replace the two autoinjector Mark I nerve agent antidote kit with a single autoinjector that will speed the administration of lifesaving antidotes for nerve agents to casualties in the field.

Chapter 8 - 1993 DAHSUM

Army researchers also continued to make substantial progress in developing computerized performance assessment tools to measure the impact of environmental stressors on human performance. The Army developed eighteen new computerized performance tests that were useful in predicting significant decreases in performance under conditions that might prevail on a chemical battlefield. These tests became national and international standards for assessing the impacts of stressors on human performance.

## Army Chaplaincy

During FY 1993 the Chaplain Branch continued to reduce its end strength. The number of Chaplain personnel serving in O-2 through O-6 positions declined from 1,420 to 1,321, with the majority of losses in the O-2 and O-3 grades.

The Chaplain School temporarily expanded during the fiscal year to provide an additional 122 Advanced Individual Training seats for MOS 71M, Chaplain Assistant. These graduates brought MOs 71M back to fully assigned strength, after a 17 percent cut in assigned chaplain assistants under the FY 1992 drawdown.

In March 1993 DOD nominated the U.S. Army Chaplain Center and School, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, for realignment to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process. The realignment was approved on 30 September 1993. In anticipation of the move, the Chaplain School and Fort Jackson agreed that a new building would have to be constructed to house the school at Fort Jackson.

Suicide prevention continued to be a major challenge for chaplains in FY 1993. The Army had eighty-four suicides during the fiscal year. Chaplains received suicide prevention training at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, during April. This marked the second suicide prevention course offered by the Chief of Chaplains and the first opened to other DOD chaplains. The course was attended by 99 chaplains and 38 chaplain assistants in active duty assignments; 9 reserve component, 1 Air Force,

## 105

and 13 Navy chaplains also participated in the training. In August 82 active Army chaplains, 6 active Army chaplain assistants, 16 reserve component chaplains, 32 Navy chaplains, and 22 Air Force chaplains attended the first advanced course on family dynamics in suicide.

## Army Sports Program

In FY 1993 the Army Sports Program fielded championship teams in men's and women's basketball, Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling, boxing, women's softball, and men's and women's track and field teams. Budget constraints and declining participation among active duty personnel led the Armed Forces Sports Committee to eliminate racquetball and tennis from the 1994 sports calendar.

## Army Library Program

In FY 1993 the Army General Library Program purchased 56,895 books, mainly for post libraries, at a cost of $1,566,516. As in previous years, only nonfiction books were purchased, with emphasis on procuring reference books for educational purposes. In another program, paperback book kits, mostly recreational in nature, were purchased and issued to support military personnel without access to a library. The Army purchased and distributed a total of 12,610 paperback book kits at a cost of $833,640. This figure represented an increase over the previous fiscal year, owing to the need to provide additional kits to support deployments in Somalia and Macedonia. Base closures and the Army drawdown resulted in the closure of eighteen main and fifty-five branch libraries. Where possible, materials and equipment were relocated to other Army libraries to augment or replace worn property. Most excess collections in Germany were turned over to the U.S. Information Agency for redistribution.

## Army Casualty and Memorial Affairs

In FY 1993 there were 664 active duty deaths in the Army, a decrease from the previous fiscal year's total of 744. There

Chapter 8 - 1993 DAHSUM

were 192 Army family members who died while stationed overseas, a slight increase from the FY 1992 total of 188. The Army also suffered seventy-three casualties in support of the United Nations humanitarian relief effort in Somalia, including eight hostile and four nonhostile deaths. Elements of the 54th Quartermaster Company (Mortuary Affairs) handled remains departing from Somalia.

During the fiscal year the Army completed 1,949 line-of-duty investigations (LDI) and received 1,732 new cases. LDIs examine circumstances

106

surrounding the death, injury, or illness of a soldier to establish whether the service member or family is entitled to benefits. FY 1993 LDIs included 586 death cases closed and 594 received; 688 Physical Evaluation Board cases closed and 667 received; 663 disease/injury cases closed and 464 received; and 12 Army Board for the Correction of Military Records cases closed and 7 received.

In FY 1993 the Army continued to improve its casualty reporting system. On 15 March 1993, the Casualty and Memorial Affairs Operations Center (CMAOC) implemented the Army Casualty Information Processing System (ACIPS). This system upgraded PERSCOM's casualty reporting and system management capabilities and allowed Casualty Area Commands and personnel units to access current casualty information. ACIPS provides the capability of receiving and automatically loading casualty reports sent via Autodin (Automated Defense Information Network) or DDN (Defense Data Network) from anywhere in the world. With the new system, PERSCOM's Casualty Operations Center can verify the relevant personal and military data in newly received casualty reports against information in the Total Army Personnel Data Base (TAPDB). If a casualty report lacks information, ACIPS can retrieve data from TAPDB. After ACIPS processes the data, PERSCOM coordinates the notification of the family members and their requests for assistance. ACIPS also tracks the movement of remains from the place of death to interment and supplies information on the method of identification and the condition and disposition of the remains.

The automated casualty system is invaluable to mortuary affairs personnel because of its capability to provide information on escorts, burial honors, memorialization requests, reimbursement of funeral or interment expenses, personal effects, line-of-duty investigations, and invitational travel orders. ACIPS contains missing persons data, including Army personnel unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. ACIPS also supports information exchanges with the casualty commands, the Personal Effects Depot, and the Mass Fatality Information Management System used by the Port of Entry Mortuaries at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, and Travis Air Force Base, California. PERSCOM developed an ACIPS (Light) as a software package designed to provide automation assistance for casualty reporting from personnel units deployed to the field. The software is a stand-alone application that operates on a laptop or desktop computer and can rapidly create casualty reports. The ACIPS (Light) is scheduled to be fielded early to Somalia, prior to the projected fielding date of May 1994. The XVIII Airborne Corps began ongoing tests for a new mass casualty module designed to substantially reduce the time required to enter data during mass casualty incidents.

## Army POW/MIA Support

The National League of POW/MIA Families is the only officially recognized POW/MIA family advocacy group representing Americans unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. Specialists from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center used the league's 24th annual national meeting on 16 and 17 July as an opportunity to collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples for a DNA repository from family members as a reference for comparison with recovered remains. About 275 DNA reference samples from families of approximately 150 unaccounted-for service members were collected through the league. The CMAOC POW/MIA Office provided family members the chance to review files on their missing relatives and arranged government-sponsored travel for POW/MIA family members to attend official briefings presented at the annual league meeting. The Army also provided representatives for two regional league events during the fiscal year.

In response to a request from the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in January 1992, DOD's Central Documentation Office (CDO) instructed the Army to forward all POW/MIA-related documents to the committee for review or to the Library of Congress for release to the public. The Army formed a 33-person team, Task Force 250, to review and process the material that had accumulated over the past twenty-five years. All relevant information was forwarded to the CDO by December 1992. The CDO instructed the services to conduct a final review of the POW/MIA material in September 1993, but no additional Army documents were provided. Approximately sixteen linear feet of Army records were being held in evidentiary custody by the FBI and the Army Criminal Investigation Command and could not be processed for public distribution until released back to the Army.

During the fiscal year the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii (CILHI), continued its mission to search for, recover, and identify the remains of unaccounted-for soldiers, primarily from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The CILHI supports all services in the search for MIAs. In FY 1993 the CILHI sent out thirty-eight teams on recovery missions in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Korea, New Guinea, Armenia, and Guadalcanal. These missions represented more than 16,000 deployed man-days involving investigations and excavations. The agency's major focus was on the search for remains in Indochina under Joint Task Force-Full Accounting (JTF-FA). In Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, CILHI teams performed 764 investigations and 68 excavations in support of JTF-FA. Search and recovery missions, official repatriations, and third-party turnovers yielded 118 sets of remains that were sent to the CILHI for study and possible identification. Most of the

108

remains were from the Vietnam War, with 54 from Vietnam, 8 from Laos, and 11 from Cambodia. In other major efforts, fifteen remains from World War II and twelve service members lost during the Cold War were recovered. North Korea provided seventeen remains from the Korean War. Although the North Koreans provided a list of twenty names associated with the remains, none have been identified due to the condition and commingling of the remains and a lack of recovery site information. CILHI personnel recommended 35 identifications among remains received before FY 1993: 31 from the Vietnam War, 3 from World War II, and 1 from peacetime Japan.

## Army Postal Operations

Operation RESTORE HOPE proved a big test for Army postal service during the fiscal year. The 711th Adjutant General (AG) Company (Postal) was activated for the operation as an active Army unit but was staffed entirely by Army reservists from across the country who volunteered to serve on temporary training for active duty (TTAD) status for 179 days. As a general support postal unit, the company received bulk mail from the Air Force's postal squadron in Mogadishu and sorted and delivered it to the 129th AG Company (Postal), which distributed the mail to individual units participating in the relief effort.

During FY 1993 the Army worked to resolve ongoing postal operation shortfalls. The Total Army Analysis 2001, which helped determine the Army's force structure, approved an increase in the number of active Army direct support postal units beginning in FY 1996. The new postal companies are planned to have a four-person headquarters element and to support two to six postal platoons. Each platoon of sixteen soldiers is expected to provide postal support for 6,000 troops. Under the new plan, in October 1995 FORSCOM is scheduled to activate the 175th AG Company (Postal) with two platoons and the 151st AG Company (Postal) with three platoons and assign them to I and III Corps, respectively. The XVIII Airborne Corps' 129th AG Company (Postal) is scheduled to be reorganized into four platoons.

Recent contingencies have reinforced the need for permanent, preassigned nine-digit Zip Codes and mail sorting by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) before packages leave CONUS. The USPS agreed to provide nine-digit sorting in CONUS, and this agreement helped in the development of the new postal TOE force structure during the fiscal year. At the beginning of Operation RESTORE HOPE, no methodology had been established for USPS sorting to the unit level, and an interim Zip Code assignment was developed. The Army Military Postal Service Agency developed a format that assigned a unique nine-digit Zip Code to each unit. The first

five numbers of the Zip Code identified mail to the division level, and the four-digit suffix identified the package to the company level. This system offered the advantages of a universal indicator of a contingency deployment and a standardized number assignment, so that units and soldiers would know their overseas addresses before they deployed. The Zip Code remained the same no matter where the unit deployed, and the system allowed for future automation by the USPS. The USPS was able to provide the Army with 90 percent of the first-class letters already sorted to unit level before they left CONUS.

## Army Heraldry Activities

The Institute of Heraldry (TIOH) is a U.S. Army activity supporting the armed forces, the Executive Office of the President, and other federal agencies. During the fiscal year TIOH designed more than 307 distinctive shoulder sleeve insignia or coats of arms for Army units and ROTC schools. For example, TIOH designers developed new insignia for Army and Air Force Muslim chaplains. In addition, the agency prepared 328 designs for the Air Force and 21 coats of arms for new ships or shore activities belonging to the Navy and Coast Guard and sculpted several plaques or seals for DOD organizations. TIOH also supported non-DOD activities by designing a shoulder patch for the Bureau of Indian Affairs Law Enforcement Office and producing presidential and vice presidential plaques for the White House Logistics Office and the White House Communications Agency.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

In FY 1993 the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) became the ninth largest retailer in the nation, reporting record sales of $7.7 billion (including concessionaire sales). AAFES profits added $212.3 million to Morale, Welfare, and Recreation activities funding, with $127.4 million of the total going to Army MWR funds. Beginning in February 1993, AAFES reorganized elements of its headquarters, establishing directorates in sales, store operations, logistics, and change management. To help modernize its business practices, AAFES created eight strategic business groups (SBG) under its Sales Directorate. Each SBG is designed to focus attention on specific aspects of AAFES business, such as main stores, food and theaters, military clothing, and direct marketing. Another significant organizational change was the April closure of the AAFES Norton Distribution Center at Riverside, California.

AAFES also had a busy year serving military personnel at home and on deployments overseas. In October 1992 USAREUR requested AAFES

to support personnel from the 212th Surgical Hospital (Mobile Army) who were scheduled to deploy to Zagreb, Croatia, in the coming months. AAFES-Europe provided videotaped movies and imprest funds for 212th and other medical units sent to Zagreb during Operation PROVIDE PROMISE. In June 1993 AAFES began supporting Operation ABLE SENTRY, as a company from the 6th Battalion, 502d Infantry Regiment, deployed to Macedonia. When U.S. troops began arriving in Somalia in December 1992 as part of Operation RESTORE HOPE, AAFES provided deploying Army units 20,000 U.S. flag patches and free sewing services as well as morale-lifting videotaped movies. AAFES also established a distribution point in Mogadishu and seven tactical field exchanges (TFE) in Somalia. Other TFEs were established to support Operation RESTORE HOPE personnel operating in Mombassa, Kenya, and Cairo, Egypt. Sales at these exchanges exceeded $5 million, and more than 1,200 tons of merchandise was sold.

## Army Laundry Services

The Army continued providing laundry services for soldiers under both garrison and field conditions during the fiscal year. The Army assisted the Joint Interservice Regional Support Group Number 10 in performing a regional garrison laundry services study focused on the East Coast. The purpose of the study was to determine if the efforts of the individual services could be combined to provide a more economical means of providing laundry service at military installations and Veterans Affairs facilities. The U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command, responsible for clothing and services, continued efforts to review current laundry facilities throughout the United States to determine how to improve and modernize laundry services and to ascertain which facilities could benefit the most from prompt attention. As a

result, the Army altered the management of several laundry facilities during FY 1993. The laundry facility at Fort Eustis, Virginia, was converted in October 1992 from a government-owned, contractor-operated facility to one run by the Richmond Veterans Hospital through the negotiation of a memorandum of understanding between the Army and the Department of Veterans Affairs. As of 1 March 1993, Fort Bragg's laundry facility converted from a governmentowned, contractor-operated to a contractor-owned, contractor-operated organization. A new laundry and dry cleaning facility for Fort Jackson, South Carolina, began operation on 2 August 1993 through a third-party contract. On 30 August 1993, the command completed a $1,650,000 project to procure new equipment and enlarge the laundry facility at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. During the fiscal year the command also coordinated with ten separate installations to redistribute forty pieces of excess laun- dry and dry cleaning equipment valued at more than $1 million. The U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command also provided technical assistance on field laundry services to active Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard units through five on-site inspection visits carried out during the fiscal year.

During the fiscal year the U.S. Army Natick Research, Development, and Engineering Center tested and approved the concept of the Laundry Water Reuse System. The water reuse system is expected eventually to be added to the M85 trailer-mounted laundry to reduce water consumption. As part of the Force Provider system, Natick also completed the prototype of the Containerized Laundry System (CLS) using commercial equipment. Plans call for the CLS to provide a self-service laundry facility that can be used during contingencies and humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions. Looking toward the future, Natick worked on a project to revolutionize the way the Army launders clothing and individual equipment by initiating the development of the first prototype of the Laundry and Drycleaning System (LADS). A nonaqueous, closed-loop system, LADS is expected to clean and dry clothing in one system, thus eliminating the need for water and reducing manpower requirements in the field.

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

Corps of Engineers (COE) military construction (MILCON) projects fall into several general programs, including Military Construction, Army (MCA); support to other DOD agencies; assistance for other federal, state, and local governments; and support to other nations. In FY 1993 there were forty projects in the MCA program, with a total value of $297 million. As of 30 September 1993, the COE had awarded only eight of these forty projects, programmed at $68 million (23 percent of the total program value). Several factors accounted for the delays. This fiscal year was the first in which a large number of projects was added to the MCA program by Congress during budget approval. These late additions delayed more than half of the programs, while high costs, environmental issues, and recertification due to Base Realignment and Closure decisions accounted for the remaining project holdups. The COE provided construction support to DOD agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency and the National Security Agency and aided other DOD construction programs such as the Ballistic Missile Defense MILCON Program, the DOD Medical Program, the Pentagon Renovation Program, and the DOD School Program. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the COE forecast awarding 150 projects worth $867 million, but by the end of the year only 107 projects worth $739 million had been awarded. Forty-five of the awarded projects, with a programmed value of $387 million, were autho- rized and appropriated during the fiscal year, while the remainder had received prior appropriations. Some of the most prominent projects awarded in FY 1993 included the Armed Forces Recreation Center at Fort DeRussy, Hawaii ($87 million, approved FY 1991); a new heating and refrigeration plant at the Pentagon ($56 million, approved FY 1993); the DLA Operations Center in Columbus, Ohio ($89 million, approved FY 1992); and improvements at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas ($26 million, approved FY 1993).

During the fiscal year the COE spent $795 million under the Support for Others (SFO) Program, involving more than 1,200 work years of effort. The SFO Program assists other federal agencies; states, commonwealths, and territories; and local governments that lack the institutional technical expertise to meet their own engineering needs or that lack the staff

to effectively manage similar work conducted by private contracting firms. COE personnel provide engineering, environmental, and construction management services to these customers, who have to fully fund its support efforts. Environmental work consumed 60 percent of the SFO effort. The largest single program, which involved emergency response assistance efforts, cost the COE more than $320 million. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding required the COE to support Federal Emergency Management Agency relief programs in Arizona, California, Texas, Iowa, Ohio, New York, Illinois, Florida, Guam, and Hawaii. Another major effort involved the COE management of $300 million in work for the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program. Major construction management projects that supported other federal agencies during the fiscal year included the renovation of the General Accounting Office headquarters and a new campus for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Education and Training Center. The COE also conducted seismic vulnerability evaluations of approximately 170 Federal Aviation Administration control towers.

The COE International Activities Program (IAP), included under the Foreign Military Sales Program (managed for the Defense Security Assistance Agency), provided support for DOD and other U.S. civilian agencies overseas and support to foreign countries and international organizations that eventuated in strengthening U.S. firms. The IAP also included congressionally authorized activities along the nation's borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as cooperative science and technology exchanges with other countries and contracting for foreign manufactured equipment or research. Operating under guidelines similar to the SFO Program, the COE provided engineering, construction, and environmental support to customers on a reimbursable basis. The FY 1993 IAP program was valued at approximately $465 million. More than $400 million of this total supported the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Program, and most of the remainder supported other U.S. agencies under the Economy Act. Under that act, the COE continued its international support of the U.S. Agency for International Development's recovery efforts to aid the Philippines after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The COE handled several security upgrades at U.S. Information Agency facilities; improvements at Voice of America radio transmission sites in Morocco, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Botswana, and Sao Tome; cold regions engineering projects in Antarctica and Greenland for the National Science Foundation; and aid to the Environmental Protection Agency by sending water and wastewater equipment to Poland. The COE also provided operations and maintenance support to the Pacific islands managed by the Department of the Interior and continued a project begun in FY 1992 of working on renovations of State Department office buildings that are scheduled to serve as U.S. embassies in Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and several other nations of the former Soviet Union.

Through the FMS Program, the COE during the fiscal year assisted thirty nations with eighty-one projects valued at $403 million. In twenty-one African nations, the African Civic Action Program involved thirty-two projects funded under the Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) and valued at $1 million. These COE efforts helped local engineers design and build facilities that benefited the host nation military and civilian populations, while other COE efforts sought to preserve wildlife and natural resources crucial to local economies. In Latin America the COE assisted in thirty-two FMFP-funded projects in six nations, valued at $17 million for the fiscal year. After the El Salvador peace settlement, the focus of the FMS Program in Latin America shifted from security assistance military infrastructure projects in El Salvador and Honduras to infrastructure construction for counternarcotics forces in Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. The COE FMS efforts in the Middle East aided three nations and involved seventeen projects valued at $385 million. The COE continued to rebuild Kuwait's military infrastructure and provided additional infrastructure assistance to Saudi Arabia. The United States began a three-year, $300 million project to equip the Saudi Arabian National Guard with light armored vehicles (LAV) and implemented a four-year, $200 million program to supply Saudi Arabia with M1A2 tanks and a four-year, $500 million project to expand that nation's naval facilities. In Egypt, the COE FMFP efforts continued to center on the long-term modernization of air and naval facilities.

Other International Activities Program initiatives included the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program that the COE began supporting in FY 1993. The United States created this program to gain assurances from the nations of the former Soviet Union that they would dismantle their weapons of mass destruction. In return for their cooper-

ation, the United States assisted with the disarmament effort. There is currently a long-term storage problem for the fissile material from dismantled nuclear weapons of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazahkstan. The lack of a safe and secure storage facility will delay the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) obligations for both the ratified START I and the pending START II. Until the obligations have been met, there is a risk that nuclear materials may fall under terrorist control. The United States and Russia wanted all nuclear warheads from the new republics dismantled and shipped to Russia for storage. Under the CTR Program the COE is helping with a fissile material storage facility constructed in Russia. At the close of FY 1993, the Ukraine and Belarus maintained nuclear weapons on their soil, and only Kazahkstan was nuclear free. Both Ukraine and Belarus maintained that they needed family housing for the retiring military officers before they would stand down the nuclear-equipped units and transfer the fissile material to Russian control. As a result, during the fiscal year the COE was engaged in constructing family housing in those countries so that disarmament could proceed. Since Russia also maintained the former Soviet Union's chemical munitions arsenal, in FY 1993 the COE also was engaged in designing and building a pilot plant to neutralize the chemical agents from the nerve agent munitions.

FY 1993 was a year of continuing change for COE facilities and real property. A significant organizational change occurred on 19 August 1993 when the COE Engineering and Housing Support Center reorganized and became the U.S. Army Center for Public Works (USACPW). Other major changes included the Army's total number of installations falling from 2,320 to 2,134 during the fiscal year as the Base Realignment and Closure Commission and the Facility Reduction Program continued to have an impact on the Army. The year's decrease in installations was dramatically reflected in the lowering of the Army's FY 1993 Plant Replacement Value (PRV), which was set at $162 billion. The PRV represented the cost to replace Army facilities, excluding land, and the FY 1993 figure was 4.6 percent, or $7.4 billion, less than that for the previous fiscal year. The transfer of former USAREUR communities to the German federal government accounted for the majority of the PRV reduction. Real Property Maintenance Activity expenditures for the year were $5.1 billion, which represented one of the single largest Army programs. This money was used to manage the Army's 44 major installations, 109 minor installations, and 1,981 other facilities. To help reduce expenses, the Army applied new procedures for managing contracts and controlling costs for miscellaneous services (pest control, trash collection, custodial support). New cost-saving energy programs, which reduced energy use by 17 percent, also improved efficiency.

115

The cost of deferred maintenance and repair projects continued to pose a challenge for the Army in FY 1993. During the fiscal year the deferred costs increased by $30 million. A major portion of the Army's buildings were at least thirty-six years old and required escalating maintenance to prevent deterioration. In an effort to improve the tracking of facilities requirements, the USACPW helped develop and test the new Installation Status Report (ISR) at eleven CONUS installations. The ISR is intended to reduce inspections and better provide senior Army managers with an evaluation of facilities.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

In November 1992 the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) and the Chief of Engineers announced plans for a Corps of Engineers (COE) reorganization. The plans provided for closing five division offices and consolidating certain technical functions at approximately one-third of the COE districts. Strong opposition from members of Congress and local communities that would be affected by the reorganization delayed implementation of the reorganization. The plans were put on hold until the incoming Clinton presidential administration could review the proposals. At the end of the fiscal year, the plan remained under review by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Funds appropriated for the COE Civil Works program for FY 1993 totaled $3,852,632,000, an increase of $184,499,000 over the previous fiscal year. Congressional action provided $3,677,632,000 through the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1993 (Public Law 102-377) and $175,000,000 from the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Relief from the Major, Widespread Flooding in the Midwest Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-75). At the end of the fiscal year, a total of $122,289,000 remained unobligated and was rescinded, reducing the total available to $3,730,343,000. This amount was augmented by $33,173,000 from the Coastal Wetlands Restoration Trust Fund and by $156,000,000 from Rivers and Harbors Contributed Funds paid by nonfederal sponsors under terms of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 86), for a program total of $3,919,516,000.

As COE facilities aged and more projects were completed, the relative size and importance of the Operation and Maintenance, General, program continued to grow during FY 1993. This trend continued despite the changes in the law established under WRDA 86 that made operation and maintenance of many new projects a fully nonfederal responsibility. Of the $1,596,668,000 appropriated for Operation and Maintenance, General, 28 percent, or $446,164,000, was derived from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. This fund, authorized in WRDA 86, received fees paid for the use of harbors for imports, exports, and domestic coastal shipping.

The COE authorized workforce for the Civil Works program in FY 1993 was 27,401 full-time equivalent (FTE) work years, or 324 fewer than in FY 1992. In February 1993 President Clinton issued Executive Order 12839, mandating a reduction of 100,000 FTEs in the federal government workforce over the next four years. The COE share of the reduction totaled 1,109 FTEs. Further COE reorganizations and cuts may be needed to meet a proposed goal of approximately 26,000 FTEs by FY 1999.

In FY 1993 flood control remained a top COE Civil Works priority. The great Midwest flood of 1993 was a natural disaster without historic precedent in terms of precipitation, record river stages, flood duration, extent of flooding, crop and property damage, and economic impact. Record and near-record summer rains fell on soil already saturated by the spring's snowmelt and precipitation. This combination produced flooding along major river systems and their tributaries in the upper Mississippi River basin in a nine-state region. River levels exceeded flood stage at approximately 500 official recording locations, and the U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations recorded enormous stream flows. Many locations remained above flood stage for weeks, and some were flooded for five straight months. The flood closed the Upper Mississippi to navigation for more than two months.

COE hydraulic and hydrologic engineers in the COE Division and District Reservoir Control Centers regulated the COE's seventy-six reservoirs in the upper Mississippi River basin throughout the flood to store floodwater and reduce the flooding damage. Altogether these reservoirs helped control a drainage area of 369,143 square miles. The COE estimated that these flood control facilities prevented $19.1 billion in additional damages during the floods. Augmenting

the upstream reservoirs, the levees and floodwalls in the St. Louis metropolitan area prevented another $3 billion in damages, and similar flood control measures near Kansas City prevented $5.6 billion in damages to that city. COE flood control measures included providing 31 million sandbags to state and local authorities and repairing levees that had been severely damaged. By the end of FY 1993, COE estimates indicated that completing all repairs could cost as much as $250 million.

In FY 1993 the COE continued to maintain and improve the nation's coastal waterways. The COE oversaw more than 200 deep-draft coastal ports and channels, another 635 shallow-draft harbors (both coastal and inland), and nearly 25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal, and coastal waterways.

The COE annually removes through dredging approximately 300 million cubic yards of material from coastal and inland waters. Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures for the coastal and Great Lakes ports amounted to $523 million in FY 1993, of which $477 million was subject

## 118

to reimbursement through the Harbor Maintenance Tax paid by commercial shippers. Another $109 million in federal spending went for new coastal harbor improvements, with an additional $88 million coming from nonfederal sponsors.

In FY 1993 the COE maintained 167 lock sites with 216 lock chambers, situated on approximately 11,000 miles of inland and intracoastal waterway system channels. The COE also began major rehabilitation on two locks on the Upper Mississippi River and four locks on the Illinois River.

During the fiscal year the COE had 8 dams under design, 8 under construction, and 567 in operation. The COE spent approximately $16 million in O&amp;M funding on modifications of dams and repairs related to dam safety. Another $75 million in construction costs was spent during the fiscal year under the Dam Safety Assurance Program. Most of this sum ($60.2 million) went to fix seismic and hydrologic deficiencies at the Mud Mountain Dam, including work on its spillway and tunnel outlet and a new intake tower. The COE also ran a number of training and outreach programs to increase dam safety and help inspectors locate potential structural problems.

## Environmental Protection

During FY 1993 the Army adopted a new environmental strategy to assist in administering more than 20 million acres at its military installations and civil works projects. In a Pentagon ceremony held on 19 November 1992, the Honorable Michael P. W. Stone, Secretary of the Army, and General Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief of Staff, Army, signed "U.S. Army Environmental Strategy into the 21st Century." The Army's environmental strategy defined the service's goals and described its four environmental pillars-compliance, restoration, prevention, and conservation.

In FY 1993 the Army reorganized its environmental programs to improve efficiency. At the secretariat level, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Logistics, and Environment and the newly created Army Environmental Policy Institute provided policy and oversight. However, at the Army Staff level and below there were three major organizations concerned with environmental issues-the Army Environmental Office (AEO); the COE Natural and Cultural Resources Division, Engineering and Housing Support Center (EHSC); and the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency. In early FY 1993 the Army decided to consolidate some of these offices under the Director of Environmental Programs (DEP), a newly created position. The first director, Brig. Gen. Gerald C. Brown, reported directly to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management-also a newly established position- and was responsible for environmental issues. The former AEO staff became the Office of the Director of Environmental Programs. The general officer-level directorate's position within the Army Staff gave environmental concerns a strong voice and allowed for better coordination with installation managers.

In February 1993 the Army reorganized and redesignated the Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency as the U.S. Army Environmental Center (AEC), located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. The AEC answered directly to the DEP and implemented programs for pollution prevention, environmental restoration, and conservation of natural and cultural resources. The Army Environmental Policy Institute had taken the lead in developing the Army's new environmental policy, and in FY 1993 AEC became responsible for implementing the strategy. The Army wanted participation at all levels to fully realize its environmental strategy, and the AEC developed a plan to increase soldier awareness of environmental concerns. In December 1992 Army leaders approved the Army Environmental Training Master Plan to integrate environmental awareness and training into the Army school system. The plan included providing resources and training aids to address environmental concerns in units and other non-classroom settings found at most installations. The AEC monitored the training program and was scheduled to prepare annual progress reports. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) assigned the U.S. Army Engineer School, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, as the proponent for integrating environmental awareness into the TRADOC school system.

In January 1993 the Army established new procedures for better managing threatened or endangered species on Army installations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified 118 federally recognized threatened or endangered species living on 100 Army installations in FY 1993. The number of threatened species was expected to increase as the Fish and Wildlife Service addressed the growing list of candidate species waiting for review. The most prominent of the already identified endangered species were the red-cockaded woodpecker at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Stewart, Georgia; the desert tortoise at Fort Irwin, California; the sage grouse at Yakima Training Center, Washington; the blackcapped vireo at Fort Hood, Texas; and Sanborn's long-nosed bat at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Full compliance with the provisions of the Endangered Species Act placed severe constraints on the Army's use of its land for training and other missions. The new Army-wide guidance established procedures for coordinating with the Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as with state environmental agencies. It also set guidelines for identifying new species needing state or federal protection and for the development of plans to manage endangered species and preserve critical habitats.

## 120

In April 1993 the Army released a report to Congress that inventoried 190 sites throughout the United States and its territories that were identified as having a potential for containing old buried chemical warfare material. The 190 sites were potentially dangerous because they were used as burial locations for chemical munitions prior to 1970. Since that year the Army has disposed of chemical munitions through incineration at very high temperatures rather than burning them at lower temperatures or neutralizing them with lime before burying the materials. The general public did not have access to 144 sites because they were located on military installations, but another 46 sites were located in public areas. The report, entitled "Interim Survey and Analysis Report of the Non-Stockpile Chemical Material Program," stated that there was no immediate threat to the public and included the service's plan for safely managing the sites. The Army planned to conduct extensive investigations at each site to determine the appropriate measures for cleaning contaminated areas. Plans called for assessment and clean-up procedures to be coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental programs. The Army also informed the congressional delegations of the affected states, as well as governors and local area officials. The Army considered chemical materials produced during the era of the two world wars less hazardous than the recently produced chemical munitions currently stockpiled as a deterrent.

## Army Energy Program

In FY 1993 the Army Energy Office continued to manage the Army Energy Program, with assistance from the Army Energy Steering Committee. The committee's members currently include representatives from the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (Facilities and Housing Directorate); the U.S. Army Center for Public Works (Directorate of Engineering, Mechanical and Energy Division); and the Logistics Evaluation Agency. During the fiscal year the Army remained committed to managing its energy resources efficiently and continued its successful efforts to meet the energy resources management goals of the National Energy Policy Act and Executive Order 12759, Federal Energy Management. These efforts included reducing facilities energy usage (measured in British thermal units per square foot) by 17 percent. Overall process energy consumption was reduced by 34 percent, but this saving was largely due to closing the production line of an ammunition plant. Mobility energy consumption was reduced 26 percent.

Financially, the total energy bill for the fiscal year was $1.176 billion, up from the FY 1992 energy bill of $1.13 billion.

To help encourage and reward prudent management, the Army presented Secretary of the Army Energy Conservation Awards to six installa- tions in August 1993. The U.S. Training Center and Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Letterkenny Army Depot, Pennsylvania; and USAREUR's 100th Support Group (Area Support) were winners in the active Army category. Idaho and Louisiana took first and second place in the Army National Guard category, while the 79th U.S. Army Reserve Command was the Army Reserve's winner. Competing against the rest of the federal government, Army installations and personnel won eight of forty-four awards at the 1993 Federal Energy Efficiency Awards.

## Legal Affairs

On 3 February 1993, the Office of Government Ethics' (OGE) Standards of Ethical Conduct became effective throughout the armed services and the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. Publication of the OGE standards ended a piecemeal process that started in FY 1992 whereby separate OGE rules continually superseded elements of the Army's AR 600-50, Standards of Conduct . OGE's guidelines are generally the same as the Army's standards of conduct in setting standards for ethics training, financial disclosures, and other ethics issues.

On 30 August the Secretary of Defense signed DOD Directive 5500.7 and 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), superseding the remaining sections of AR 600-50 and the elements of any other Army regulation inconsistent with DOD policy. JER republished and supplemented the OGE standards and provided additional DOD guidance. JER represents the single source of ethics guidance within DOD, and the services cannot supplement the regulation. Although ethics counselors are now appointed through legal instead of command channels, the JER clearly establishes the commander's responsibility for ethics. For the first time, Army personnel have detailed and specific guidance on official and personal participation in private associations and rules on accepting travel benefits from nongovernment sources. Some sections of the JER are enforceable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and administrative sanctions may be used for other violations.

The new ethics rules required a massive training effort. Requirements outlined in AR 600-50 were relatively general and lacked firm accountability procedures. Under the new guidelines the Army must submit annual training plans and reports on its training accomplishments to OGE. OGE may also conduct audits to check for compliance. In FY 1993 all military and civilian Army personnel were required to receive an hour's orientation on the new standards of ethical conduct. All new employees receive an orientation, and certain employees who file public or confidential financial disclosure reports must receive annual training.

## 122

The number of courts-martial continued to decline in FY 1993. General courts-martial constituted more than half of all courts-martial. Charges involving drug use and distribution, murder, robbery, and sexual assault formed a significant percentage of the offenses before courts-martial. Table 13 represents military justice trends from FY 1989 to FY 1993.

TABLE 13-MILITARY JUSTICE TRENDS FROM FY 1989 TO FY 1993

|                                   | FY 1989   | 1990   | 1991   | 1992   | 1993   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Courts-Martial                    | 2,620     | 2,372  | 1,852  | 1,778  | 1,287  |
| Rate per 1,000 military personnel | 3.45      | 3.26   | 2.59   | 2.86   | 2.20   |

The rate of nonjudicial punishments given under Article 15, UCMJ, remained steady in FY 1993 at about seventy-six per thousand soldiers. Numbers and rates of administrative discharge actions, notably those under chapters 10 (in lieu of court-martial) and 14 (misconduct), AR 635-200, declined.

The United States Army Trial Defense Service (USATDS) continued to provide professional defense counsel services to soldiers throughout the Army during FY 1993. Trial service counsels represented 1,190 clients at proceedings conducted under Article 32, UCMJ; 982 clients at general courts-martial; 412 clients at special courts-martial; and 783 soldiers at administrative boards. USATDS advised 36,273 soldiers regarding nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, and 20,362 clients on a variety of adverse administrative actions. Despite a reduction in defense counsels, the service continued to operate more than seventy offices worldwide and supported the Multinational Force in the Sinai and troops in Southwest Asia, Macedonia, and Somalia.

On 11 February 1993, the CSA approved a recommendation to prohibit the use of "by law" beneficiary designations for Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI). The change required soldiers to designate their primary and contingent beneficiaries "by name" on new SGLI-8286 forms. The CSA's purpose in designating beneficiaries by name was to be certain that the Army carried out the soldiers' intentions for their SGLI benefits. The Army ensured that legal assistance attorneys were available to assist soldiers with legal questions about the SGLI-8286 forms or beneficiary designations. Attorneys also assisted soldiers (particularly divorced soldiers) wishing to execute wills that established trusts so their minor children could receive direct payment of their SGLI proceeds and other property. Soldiers completing new SGLI8286 forms were encouraged (but not required) to provide the address and social security number of each beneficiary to ensure the beneficiary could be quickly located after a sol- dier's death. Although soldiers were no longer authorized to use the "by law" designation, they were not required to immediately change their otherwise current SGLI-8286 forms, even if they used the "by law" designation. These forms will be changed to meet the new requirements when soldiers routinely update their SGLI paperwork.

The Office of the Judge Advocate General Procurement Fraud Division closed 700 cases in FY 1993, with 1,152 cases remaining open at the end of the fiscal year. This number of open cases was the highest in the division's history. The total figure for suspensions and debarments was lower than in the two previous fiscal years, a trend consistent with the decreasing number of indictments and convictions of government contractors over the three-year period. The division recovered a record $72.5 million during the fiscal year. More than $19 million was recovered from the settlement of two major cases. Goodyear Aerospace Corporation paid more than $9 million to settle allegations that it had overcharged the Army for parachutes attached to bombs to slow their descent. The settlement was reached after six years of investigation and litigation. In the second case, Teledyne Industries, Inc., paid $10 million in compensation to settle allegations that it had provided the Army with electronic aircraft identification systems that were falsely tested or had failed testing procedures. In addition to a $5 million cash payment, Teledyne agreed to a recall, screening, and repair program to ensure the reliability of systems that had already been delivered. Other significant cases resolved during the fiscal year included the criminal convictions of nine defendants resulting from one of the longest criminal trials (six months) involving one of the largest losses ever suffered due to procurement fraud (more than $100 million). Sooner Defense of Florida was tried on charges relating to false testing and false progress payment requests, primarily on fuses for ammunition for the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle. Sooner Defense and five of its officers were found guilty of a total of sixty-two charges, including money laundering, wiretapping, bribery, and conspiracy.

Contractor fraud resulted in the largest environmental crimes case ever prosecuted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1990. Chemical Waste Management, Inc., crushed and buried barrels of hazardous waste rather than properly removing and disposing of them as required by government contract. Chemical Waste Management provided $10.5 million in total compensation to resolve criminal and civil fraud allegations. This case also represented the growing cooperation between large government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and DOD in fighting fraud.

Prior to FY 1993 the Army's bid protest mission was split into two parts. Bid protests filed at the GAO were the

responsibility of the Contract Law Division, Office of the Judge Advocate General. Bid protests filed at

## 124

the General Services Board of Contract Appeals, in connection with the procurement of automated data processing equipment, were the responsibility of the Army Chief Trial Attorney, Contract Appeals Division (CAD). In FY 1993 the Army recognized the benefit of consolidating bid protest procedures. The Judge Advocate General integrated the entire bid protest mission at the Contract Appeals Division. With its new mission, CAD acquired one GM-15 attorney and two JAG attorney positions, along with one paralegal and a legal technician. The number of GAO bid protests grew to 355 during the fiscal year, 100 more than the previous year. The large majority of these were litigated after CAD assumed the responsibility for that mission. The active caseload of contract disputes before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals remained steady during the fiscal year at approximately 750 appeals. Of these, approximately 600 cases were Army appeals and 150 were from the COE. CAD also reviewed all performance and payment bonds for the Army. During the fiscal year the number of bonds reviewed decreased by 15 percent, from approximately 10,000 reviews in FY 1992 to approximately 8,500 in FY 1993.

During FY 1993 Chatman v. Shannon (D. Haw.) became the first Army case to go to a jury trial under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The plaintiff alleged race discrimination when he was removed from the federal civil service and filed a civil action after the Merit Systems Protection Board upheld his removal. The jury upheld the Merit Systems Protection Board findings and returned a verdict favorable to the Army.

On 29 January 1993, President Clinton announced an interim policy pending a study of the ban on homosexuals in the military. The policy, referred to as "don't ask, don't tell," prohibited asking prospective recruits about their sexual orientation. On 19 July the President announced a new DOD policy that incorporated the provisions of the January policy and placed limitations on conducting investigations of alleged homosexuality. This policy became known as "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" and clarified that only homosexual conduct was prohibited. Forbidden conduct was defined to include homosexual acts and marriages and making statements that identified oneself as a homosexual. Congress conducted hearings on the policy with a view toward legislating new military homosexual policy.

The case of Pruitt v. Cheney (9th Cir.) was one of three significant homosexual cases for the Army in FY 1993. Dusty Pruitt, a lesbian minister who was married to women on two different occasions, was discharged from the Army Reserve in 1986 after disclosing her homosexuality in a newspaper article. Pruitt sued, alleging her discharge violated her right to free speech and illegally discriminated against her because she was a lesbian. The trial court dismissed her case without reaching the merits of her claim. The 9th Circuit, on appeal, reversed and remanded the case to the district court, ruling that before Pruitt's challenge could be dismissed, the Army had to produce evidence to establish that the homosexual exclusion policy was rationally related to legitimate government interests. In December 1992 the Supreme Court declined to review the 9th Circuit's decision. During the remainder of FY 1993 Pruitt was amending her complaint before the district court to more clearly assert her equal protection claim.

In Cammermeyer v. Aspin (W.D. Wash.), the former Chief Nurse of the Washington National Guard, Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer, admitted on a security application and to a Defense Investigative Service agent that she was a lesbian. An administrative board recommended withdrawal of her federal recognition, and Colonel Cammermeyer was separated from the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. She filed suit in June 1992, claiming the homosexual exclusion policy deprived her of equal protection and violated her rights to privacy and free speech. The government filed its answer to the suit in August 1993, and the case was ongoing at the end of FY 1993.

In January 1993 a federal court temporarily restrained the Army from discharging Maj. Joyce Walmer for homosexual acts in Walmer v. Department of Defense, et al. (D. Kan.). Knowledge of Walmer's homosexual acts came to light while she was a student at the Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth. After referral to a show cause board, she admitted engaging in homosexual acts and the board recommended that she receive an honorable discharge.

Walmer, however, claimed that the DOD homosexual exclusion policy lacked a rational basis and deprived her of equal protection. At the close of the fiscal year, Walmer's motion for a preliminary injunction was before the court.

## Inspector General Activities

In March 1993 the Acting Secretary of the Army, John W. Shannon, approved a Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG) Special Inspection of Environmental Program Management report that concluded that the Army's environmental program lacked unified direction, with resultant confusion and wasted resources. The report recommended appointing a general officer at HQDA to direct and coordinate all Army environmental actions. This recommendation validated an existing proposal to create an Office of the Director of Environmental Programs, which was quickly established to integrate environmental policy and programs throughout the Army Staff and support agencies.

One of the DAIG's most significant inspections in FY 1993 concerned deficiencies in the Field Artillery force structure as well as command and control problems exposed during DESERT STORM. The inspections con-

126

firmed that deficiencies existed, and DAIG produced options to resolve the problems. With the DAIG's encouragement, DCSOPS initiated an Army Science Board Ad Hoc Study, scheduled for completion in FY 1995, to consider the issues and recommend appropriate actions.

Another follow-up to DESERT STORM issues during the fiscal year resulted in the DAIG's creation of an audit trail to ensure that the Army implemented recommendations contained in the 1990/91 DAIG Special Assessment of National Guard Brigade Mobilization. Audit trails traced major reserve component initiatives from the originating source through the Roundout Brigade Task Force, Training and Leader Development Action Plans, and Title XI Task Force processes to confirm that the original intent of the DAIG recommendations was not lost and that all issues were addressed.

Other FY 1993 inspections or assessments focused on Total Army issues or responded to requirements from the Army's senior leadership. These efforts included assessments of the Army Safety Program, Operation RESTORE HOPE, stock funding of depot-level reparables, and reserve component training institutions. Areas under inspection included environmental program management, Advanced Individual Training and One Station Unit Training, and the Army's command and control of geographically dispersed detachments. Numerous technical inspections were conducted at chemical, surveillance, and reactor facilities, and, in conjunction with the DOD Inspector General, there was a special assessment of the use of live animals in research.

The DAIG's responsibilities continued to encompass investigating allegations against general officers, Senior Executive Service civilian employees, inspectors general, and officials in high-visibility positions. During the fiscal year the DAIG conducted 34 formal investigations and more than 160 preliminary inquiries. Of the thirty-four formal investigations, approximately 31 percent were substantiated. The most frequent allegations concerned fraud, waste, and abuse; questionable personnel actions; preferential treatment; misuse of government equipment and personnel for personal gain; misuse of government aircraft and vehicles; and sexual harassment and improper relationships.

The DOD waste, fraud, and abuse hotline resulted in 896 referrals to the DAIG during FY 1993, with a substantiation rate of 19 percent. The DAIG received 2,027 Inspector General Action Requests (IGAR) during the fiscal year. The active Army produced 30 percent of the requests, DA civilian personnel produced 14 percent, the reserve components produced 9 percent, and 46 percent came from unknown sources. Of the total IGARs, 640 we re for assistance and 1,387 were allegations, of which 250 allegations (18 percent) were substantiated. Nine hundred allegations (65 percent) were not substantiated and another 237 (17 percent) were not assigned categories

(neither substantiated nor nonsubstantiated). The most common type of DAIG request, of which there were 559 (28

percent), involved personal conduct, including sexual harassment, discrimination, and nonsupport of family. Command and management problems, such as exercising undue influence or deficiency in soldier and family support, resulted in 324 requests, or 16 percent of the cases. There were 284 complaints (14 percent) concerning military personnel management issues (recruiting, reassignments, evaluation, promotions, and awards) and 235 complaints (12 percent) concerning civilian personnel management issues. There were also 138 IGARs (7 percent) involving finance and accounting issues.

As a result of the HQDA Transformation Study, conducted from October 1992 to January 1993, the Army moved followup and external audit focal point functions from the U.S. Army Inspector General Agency (USAIGA) to the U.S. Army Audit Agency (AAA). Upon completion of the transfer of functions and personnel spaces on 19 September 1993, the AAA's new Audit Followup and Compliance Division became responsible for managing and overseeing the effective execution of the Army Followup and Compliance Program and keeping the Army Secretariat and Staff aware of the status of Army activity audits conducted by the DOD Inspector General, GAO, and AAA. The DAIG retained responsibility for elevating unresolved AAA issues to the VCSA or the Under Secretary of the Army and unresolved DOD Inspector General audit issues through HQDA to the Deputy Secretary of Defense for resolution.

## The Louisiana Maneuvers

Doctrinal updates were one way the Army prepared for the twenty-first century, but in FY 1993 the Army also examined the role of technology in future warfare and the way battlefield leaders could use new technologies. The Army called this process the Louisiana Maneuvers (LAM) to acknowledge another intellectual movement, spearheaded by Generals George C. Marshall and Lesley J. McNair to prepare the Army for World War II. LAM identifies issues that today's changing Army must resolve and searches for common ground among the senior leadership (four-star generals who are also referred to as the LAM Board of Directors) for examining these issues and finding a consensus. Solutions developed through LAM may result in force structure changes and the fielding of improved technologies or weapon systems. LAM expects to take the information obtained from its studies and provide accelerated feedback to the senior leadership to improve decision making on priorities for funding initiatives. A small LAM task force in the Chief of Staff's Office connected the ARSTAF to MACOMs and joint commands to help coordinate and integrate changes.

## 128

At the end of FY 1992 the LAM process identified over 200 issues for further study and refinement. A General Officer Working Group (GOWG) consisting of brigadier and major generals from the ARSTAF, MACOMs, and reserve components examined issues and presented the top twenty to the first LAM Board of Directors meeting in October 1992. Some of the "war-fighting" issues included headquarters above the corps level and joint task forces; military operations with unfamiliar forces; owning the night; battle command; and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I). The LAM Board of Directors also deliberated Title 10, U.S. Code, issues such as force structure, equipping the force, mobilization and demobilization, and sustainment.

As FY 1993 drew to a close, the LAM Task Force prepared a new agenda for a Board of Directors meeting in October 1993. Several solutions explored and developed during the fiscal year were expected to receive approval at this session. One proposal was to use commercially available space-based equipment to improve command and control of forceprojection battlefield operations. A second item was in-transit visibility, a program to track the movement of critical parts and equipment during unit deployments and sustainment operations. In-transit visibility is expected to enhance readiness of the Army's Contingency Force Package and ensure that supplies get to the right unit at the right time. Better logistics control is also expected to help lower overall stock levels in Army inventories because of the ability of such a system to stock and deliver more precisely what customers need rather than the older system's vaguer awareness of where and when needed supplies might arrive. LAM also worked with AMC to develop a computer system to support split-based logistics operations. Under this concept, instead of deploying a large logistics force to manage sustainment operations, much of the sustainment force could remain in CONUS to support the deployed force through a linked computer system that would facilitate the electronic exchange of information. This computer system would reduce the number of combat service support personnel deploying to a theater and free valuable transportation assets to move combat forces and supplies. Recognizing the growing role of the reserve components in force projection, the Board of

## Chapter 9 - 1993 DAHSUM

Directors planned to examine development of a new modeling system that would help FORSCOM analyze and plan the mobilization and deployment of the reserve components.

LAM modernization projects during FY 1993 put direct practical benefits into the hands of the soldiers. Satellite-based multispectral imagery (MSI) provided units with up-to-date maps and terrain databases, allowing commanders to receive real-time reconnaissance photographs through digital transmissions. When deteriorating conditions in the former Yugoslavia alerted the Army to begin planning for possible deployment to

## 129

Bosnia, unit leaders requested terrain information for training simulations, such as Brigade/Battalion Simulation and the Urban Combat Computer Assisted Training System (UCCATS). The Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Topographic Engineering Center used MSI and other data to build terrain databases. In less than three months USAREUR soldiers were rehearsing operations on simulated Bosnian landscapes. MSI is currently being assembled to create a UCCATS digitized terrain for U.S. forces in Somalia.

Another technology that the Army exploited during the fiscal year in preparation for potential peacekeeping missions was the use of prototype transmitters installed on Apache helicopters based in USAREUR. The transmitters send realtime images from crew sights and dedicated photographic equipment into command posts, where commanders receive immediate accurate pictures of a given situation. A similar prototype system, the Nightstalker, placed an elaborate sensor package atop an elevating mast mounted on a HMMWV. This prototype reconnaissance vehicle, which evolved from the border surveillance systems used for counterdrug operations in the American Southwest, was originally deployed to support intelligence collection in Somalia. Images from these systems could be transmitted over almost any communications system, making the information widely available to units. Army peacekeeping forces in Macedonia used another LAM technology to track the movements of their patrols and supply vehicles, also recording the motion of any vehicle or container moving in strategic, operational, or tactical environments during defined intervals.

Battlefield digitization was a major LAM initiative in FY 1993. The Army expected to use digital information technologies to increase the breadth and depth of command and control through near-real-time situational awareness. On 22 January 1993, the CSA endorsed the concept of digitizing divisions. During the fiscal year the Army's Battle Labs experimented with a number of procedures and systems to take advantage of the latest technologies in electronic and information management to greatly improve battlefield operating systems and the command and control structure. These systems are intended to link soldiers and commanders together in one vast information network, and digitization systems are expected to eventually be fielded from tank crews and infantry squads all the way up to the National Command Authority. In FY 1993 the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, evaluated the InterVehicular Information System (IVIS), which improves tactical control of mechanized units. IVIS provided all crews in the same mechanized task force with current intelligence, the locations of friendly units, graphics, and incoming orders over tactical radio in digital bursts. This was accomplished in real time as soon as the information became available. Among

other benefits, advanced systems such as IVIS are expected to help reduce the number of friendly fire losses in combat.

One of the LAM highlights for the ARSTAF was the General Headquarters Exercise (GHQx) 1993, held in August to test the ARSTAF's ability to allocate scarce resources in order to man, organize, equip, train, and sustain the Army elements provided to the combat theaters' commanders in chief (CINC). The exercise's name reflected General George Marshall's legacy and the World War II planning activities of his headquarters, although the ARSTAF is no longer a general headquarters organization. The ability to accomplish missions with limited resources became more important with the Army's continued downsizing. Following requirements laid out in the National Military Strategy, in the GHQx 1993 the ARSTAF planned resourcing for synchronizing and maintaining Army assets during two simulated regional contingencies. The GHQx 1993 coincided with two military exercises that simulated the two nearly simultaneous contingencies: FUERTES DEFENSAS in Central America and ULCHI-FOCUS LENS in Korea. These exercises

provided added realism for the Army Crisis Action Team activated to resolve the problems generated during the scenarios.

GHQx 1993 was an effective means to evaluate the Army's wartime responsibilities and its ability to support multiple war-fighting theaters. The exercise confirmed that the Army needed early access to high-priority reserve component units and selected individual reservists and that it had to work with Congress to change the legislation controlling the Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up. The GHQx 1993 revealed problems concerning mobilization and deployment planning, as well as the serious obstacles to allocating scarce military resources to support two nearly simultaneous contingencies. The GHQx 1993 proved a successful tool for the Army leadership, and Army leaders planned a larger GHQx for 1994.

## Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps

In FY 1993 Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) continued to provide leadership and citizenship training to high school students across the United States and its territories. During the fiscal year there were approximately 130,000 JROTC cadets in 1,142 high schools.

## World War II Commemoration

Since December 1990 the Army has served as the executive agent for the Department of Defense World War II Commemorative Program, in which role it established a committee to plan, coordinate, and assist in

131

fiftieth anniversary events. With the assistance of a number of DOD agencies, the Commemorative Committee financed and distributed World War II educational materials such as videos, maps, bookmarks, and fact sheets during the fiscal year. The committee also assisted a number of private commemorative efforts undertaken by communities to honor the nearly nine million remaining World War II veterans. Although hampered by limited funding, much of the committee's effort in FY 1993 was aimed at preparations for the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy invasion.

## Conclusion

During fiscal year 1993 the Army continued the struggle to reinvent itself in the wake of the end of the Cold War. As operational deployments grew dramatically from the previous fiscal year and force structure and budgets continued to decline, the Army faced sobering challenges of trying to maintain readiness while making the transition from a forwarddeployed force to a power-projection force.

On an average day during the fiscal year, the Army had 20,000 soldiers deployed to approximately seventy-five nations and performing more than a thousand operations other than war missions. Army soldiers helped stem the flow of illegal drugs, helped maintain the peace and provide medical support in new Balkan republics, and helped alleviate the suffering of thousands in Somalia.

The Army conducted these operations with a shrinking force and resources diverted from training and readiness. Army end strength went from 610,000 to approximately 572,000 during the fiscal year, the lowest it had been since FY 1948. As the size of the Army declined, pressing shortages in critical MOSs arose. For example, there was a 29 percent shortage in Multiple Launch Rocket System repairers during the fiscal year. Other personnel problems, such as a shortage of approximately 1,900 branch-qualified captains, further hampered training and readiness.

While the Army's smaller force was doing more in serving the nation, the service remained committed to supporting important modernization programs such as the Comanche RAH-66 armed reconnaissance helicopter, the Advanced Field Artillery System, and the Javelin missile system.

Although these programs received increased funding in FY 1993, procurement expenditures continued to decline, dropping 27 percent from FY 1991 levels. For example, the Javelin antitank missile system received funding only for low-rate initial production.

One measure the Army undertook to increase readiness during FY 1993 was eradicating unnecessary obstacles to service for women. In response to a change in Department of Defense policy that expanded the role of women in the military, the Army opened more specialties and assignment opportunities to women. The Army opened more than 9,000

133

new positions in combat aviation assignments to women in FY 1993 and studied opening additional positions after a new risk rule is developed.

During the fiscal year the Army continued taking steps to reorganize and improve its training and readiness support structure. The adoption of the Combined Arms Training Strategy, which helps provide training strategies for the total force and ensures that those plans interface with new combat developments, was a significant initiative to improve training efficiency. In addition, the expansion of the BOLD SHIFT initiatives, in which active Army units develop associations with Contingency Force Pool units and assist with reserve component training, helped develop a more cohesive total force.

In FY 1993 the Army continued to realign and close installations as the service underwent a transition from a forwarddeployed force to a CONUS-based, power-projection force. For example, in Europe USAREUR returned a number of bases to Germany after decades of American use. After the dramatic force reductions of the past few years created a surplus of materiel in European stockpiles, USAREUR also continued the task of shipping excess equipment back to the United States for use by other active and reserve component units. During the fiscal year USAREUR identified 55,000 excess vehicles for redistribution or disposal and shipped 137,000 tons of excess ammunition to CONUS.

Chapter 10 - 1993 DAHSUM

The Army 1993 posture statement outlined goals to maintain a "strategic force capable of decisive victory." These goals were achieved partly through organizational improvements and efficiencies during the fiscal year. An example of a notable reorganization was the creation of the provisional Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management to bring tighter control over Army facilities and help improve soldiers' quality of life and soldier retention rates. An example of a significant efficiency was the development of the Installation Status Report, which gave the Army Chief of Staff a valuable tool to monitor the fitness of the Army's infrastructure.

Other initiatives that contributed to the Army's achieving its goals included release of the revised FM 100-5, Operations . The revised manual included significant post-Cold War changes to conform with the Army's role as a power-projection force as well as its expanded role in conducting operations other than war missions. Among significant Army automation initiatives was the Army Tactical Command and Control System, a comprehensive approach to automating Army command and control systems with improved communications. Another important initiative, the ongoing Louisiana Maneuvers, helped enable Army leaders to seek new approaches to solving complex Army-wide problems such as battlefield digitization. The Army expects to use digital information technologies to increase the breadth and depth of command and control through near-real-time situational awareness.

The Army's medical research programs and Corps of Engineers Civil Works programs continued to offer positive benefits to the nation during the fiscal year. Army medical research programs developed antibiotics and made advances with blood plasma proteins that may one day assist civilians injured in accidents or violent crime. Medical personnel also investigated diseases that threatened public health and found a new means to combat malaria. The Corps of Engineers Civil Works construction programs protected lives and property during the 1993 floods. The Corps of Engineers also embarked on new projects to provide additional benefits in the future.

By the end of the fiscal year the Army was making progress in its transition from a forward-deployed force to a powerprojection force. Reduced budgets, continued downsizing, and the demands of conducting increasing numbers of operations other than war missions hampered the transition. Training, readiness, and modernization were adversely affected as Army leaders made difficult choices in serving the nation. Looking toward the future, the promise of finding additional efficiencies and innovative solutions to problems enabled Army leaders to remain focused on accomplishing the difficult transition.
