## DePARTMeNT OF THe ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YeAR 2001

## 1 Introduction

Fiscal year (FY) 2001 began auspiciously for the U.S. Army. A long period of budget and force structure reductions had come to a close, and the Army leaders were implementing ambitious plans for the future.  Throughout the  year,  the Army  planned  and  executed  organizational,  doctrinal,  and technological changes to the way it conducted warfare in the new century. The Army was following an ambitious plan named Transformation, issued in  1999  by  Secretary  of  the Army  Louis  E.  Caldera  and  Chief  of  Staff of the Army General Eric K. Shinseki. As part of Transformation, Army leaders envisioned fielding computerized, networked units within the next few years. The units would deploy quickly around the globe and would possess  the  striking  power  of  current  armored  and  mechanized  forces without  their  massive  logistical  requirements.  However,  less  than  three weeks  before  the  fiscal  year  ended,  terrorist  attacks  in  New Y ork  City and on the Pentagon claimed the lives of almost three thousand people. The Army could no longer focus on the distant future; a new conflict had begun. The Army now found itself pressed to continue modernizing while preparing for military operations in Afghanistan in the first months of what would become years of warfare.

This historical summary of FY 2001 chronicles the state of the Army as it found itself thrust into a period of prolonged conflict. Before the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Army conducted a variety of missions and responsibilities throughout the globe. It sent active and reserve units as  part  of  an  international  peacekeeping  mission  to  the  Balkans  and maintained sizable forward forces in the Middle East, western Europe, and South Korea. While helping to keep the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Army also conducted large-scale military exercises with foreign militaries and provided humanitarian assistance to foreign nations. These and other missions  would  continue  even  after  the  United  States  struck  back  at terrorist enclaves in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

The  leaders  of  Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army  (HQDA), dealt with several tumultuous issues in FY 2001. To better lead the Army in the conflicts that lay ahead, Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki realigned  the  headquarters  and  created  new  organizations  to  provide flexible and efficient management of the force. At the same time, service leaders struggled to maintain the force structure of the Army during the

2001 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), and their eventual success prevented the Army from going to war with a smaller force. Finally, an investigation into a tragic event from the Korean War proved challenging but eventually helped forge stronger bonds with South Korea.

Plans to transform the way the Army organized, trained, and waged war continued. During FY 2001, the Army selected a light swift armored vehicle for production and built a new organization around it to bridge the present Army and the Army of the future. Research and development continued to create Future Combat Systems, a collection of vehicles and sensors  connected  by  an  information  network.  Future  Combat  Systems would  provide  the  mobility  and  striking  power  of  the  Objective  Force envisioned  by  Army  senior  leaders.  The  Army  also  reorganized  and restructured  its  aviation  fleet  to  improve  maintenance  and  field  more versatile units. To change the way the Army thought about itself, Army leaders directed changes in doctrine and, controversially, altered the Army uniform to transform the identity of the force.

The Army  also  made  strides  toward  maintaining  its  present  force. During FY 2001, the Army fought successfully to increase its budget. The Army met most of its personnel requirements, with both recruiting and retention proving to be successful. The Army also sought ways to improve the leadership and development of its officers and the quality of life of its enlisted personnel. The commands of the Army Reserve and National Guard were raised to lieutenant generalships, and reservists and guardsmen continued to play vital roles in service to the nation.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Reorganizations and Realignments

Throughout the 1990s, a series of budget and personnel cuts hampered Headquarters, Department of the Army, resulting in bureaucratic inefficiencies. In 1999, Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki initiated efforts  to  bring  greater  efficiency  to  the  management  and  command structures of HQDA. The first phase of institutional transformation began in July of that year and included a study conducted by Military Professional Resources, Inc. The study concluded that the Army lacked a single point of oversight and direction for long-term programmatic development and resources management and suggested the institution of a deputy chief of staff  for  resources,  programs,  and  analysis. This  proposed  office  would combine the Office of the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff with various offices across HQDA to provide unity for the  Army' s program development efforts.

Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki accepted the basic premise of the study. As a result, a major step in the realignment of HQDA took place on 1 December 2000, when General Orders 15 added the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs to the Army Staff and disestablished the position of assistant vice chief of staff. (See Chart.) The general orders placed responsibility for the planning, developing, and funding of Army programs under the new office. The office also received the mission of directing  external  studies  commissioned  by  the Army. The  offices  that constituted the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs included the Army Quadrennial Defense Review Office and the Program Analysis and Evaluation Directorate, both formerly part of the Office of the  Assistant Vice Chief of Staff. The Force Development Directorate, formerly part of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, was also placed under the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs, as was the Directorate of Integration, which previously had been placed under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology.  The  new  office  also  included  the  Executive  Services Division and the Quadrennial Defense Review Communications Cell. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs closely resembled the

Force Structure, Resources and Assessments Directorate (J-8) of the Joint Staff and provided an Army counterpart to the staff sections of the other armed services that dealt with issues of long-term program development. After Secretary Caldera signed General Orders 15 on 3 January 2001, Lt. Gen. Kevin P . Byrnes, who was already serving as the assistant vice chief of staff, became the first deputy chief of staff for programs, with Dr. Craig E.  College  as  his  assistant. The  staff  of  the  newly  created  office  began operations  before  the  fiscal  year  ended.  (For  Department  of  the  Army organization, see Appendixes A and B .)

Other efforts to transform HQDA were under way at this time to better allocate  responsibilities  and  functions  within  the  understaffed  headquarters. From  20-21  November  2000,  the Army  Staff  hosted  a  two-day  meeting  in Arlington, Virginia,  that  gathered  together  general  officers  and  members  of the  Senior  Executive  Service  to  consider  further  changes.  The  participants examined four major categories for improvement. The first of these categories, culture, considered personal and institutional differences between the uniformed and civilian personnel who constituted headquarters staff. The second category, process,  identified  areas  where  bureaucratic  procedures  and  practices  could be streamlined or eliminated. The organization of Headquarters, Department of the Army, itself made up the third category: structure. The final category, information technology and knowledge-based organization, sought to introduce or improve the use of automated systems in order to increase efficiency.

After  the  members  of  the  meeting  established  these  categories, working groups studied more than five hundred recommendations made by an independent contractor in May 2000 to consider whether they could be  implemented,  required  further  study,  or  were  infeasible.  After  the working groups completed their assessments, Director of the Army Staff Lt. Gen. John M. Pickler assigned responsibility for creating a plan to the Strategic Management and Innovation Division in the Office of the Chief

of Staff of the Army. The division directed each Army Staff directorate to validate  the  recommendations  of  the  working  groups  and  established  a council of colonels and a general officers steering committee to oversee progress. For the next six months, the division served as the lead agent for headquarters reorganization and provided Army Staff principals with proposals to consider.

While the Strategic Management and Innovation Division continued its work, Thomas E. White succeeded Caldera as secretary of the Army in May 2001. Soon after, Secretary White created the Realignment Task Force to take over the HQDA reorganization effort. The secretary directed the task force to  reduce  and  consolidate  headquarters  structures  to  eliminate  overlapping functions and redundant layers of supervision. In addition, he wanted the task force to find better ways to use technology, automation, and modern corporate business practices within the headquarters. Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for International Affairs John W . McDonald led the task force, which began its work in June 2001. The Realignment Task Force worked in three phases: Phase I began in FY 2001 and concentrated on HQDA. The other two phases, planned to begin after FY 2001, would consider Army field operating agencies and major commands. During Phase I, the thirty-person task force had two guiding principles: the purpose of the Army Secretariat was to formulate policy and programs, and the purpose of the Army Staff was to prepare, plan, supervise, and execute those policies and programs. Incorporating findings and  recommendations  from  the  previous  work  performed  by  the  Strategic Management and Innovation Division, the task force considered changes to the alignment of responsibilities and authorities within HQDA to reflect the guiding principles. By the end of FY 2001, the task force had completed most of the planning for a major realignment of HQDA, which the Army planned to implement during the next fiscal year.

Below the Headquarters, Department of the Army, level, the Military Traffic  Management  Command,  which  is  responsible  for  the  surface transport  of  supplies  for  all  the  armed  services,  underwent  a  major reorganization during FY 2001. The Army announced that the Operations Division  and  the  Joint  Traffic  Management  Office  at  the  command' s headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, would move to Fort Eustis, Virginia, to  be  combined  with  the  Deployment  Support  Command.  This  would establish  a  new  Military  Traffic  Management  Command  Operations Center. The reorganization would reduce 250 personnel spaces and was scheduled to take place by November 2002.

## Information Management

The Army began developing Army Knowledge Online (AKO) in 1997 to  provide  Army-wide  access  to  unclassified  information  and  business

processes over a secure Internet site. Army Knowledge Online provided electronic mail, search engines, the Army White Pages, and 128-bit Secure Socket Layer encryption for security purposes to its registered users. By 1999, the Army added the AKO-Secret intranet site to provide similar ease of access to classified information across the Army.

FY 2001 saw a major increase in the use of Army Knowledge Online across the service. On 1 October 2000, AKO had ninety-six thousand users across the active Army, National Guard, Army Reserve, Department of the Army civilians, Army retirees, and selected users not directly affiliated with the Army holding guest accounts. User growth continued on a voluntary basis  until  8  August  2001,  when  Secretary  White  and  General  Shinseki issued Army Knowledge Management Guidance Memorandum Number 1. This memorandum mandated that all active duty soldiers, reserve component personnel, and Department of the Army civilians obtain an AKO account and that Army information managers develop electronic versions of applications for use on the Web site by July 2002. As a result of the mandated use of AKO accounts, Army Knowledge Online had 529,688 users by the end of the fiscal year.

Army Knowledge Management Guidance Memorandum Number 1 also  designated the Department of the Army's chief information officer as the responsible officer for all Army information technology initiatives. Additionally, the memorandum subjected information technology programs  operated  by  the  Army' s  major  commands  to  review  by  an executive board chaired by the chief information officer and directed that funds for such programs be withdrawn from major commands. These funds would henceforth be centrally managed at the HQDA level. Finally, the memorandum directed the major commands to curtail their information technology investments unless provided with a waiver and funding by the chief information officer.

## Budget

The  Army  budget  fell  during  the  1990s  as  Congress  cut  military spending after the end of the Cold War. The Army' s end strength fell from 780,000  to  480,000,  and  inadequate  funding  forced  the  cancellation  or restructuring of over a hundred programs during the decade. Between fiscal years 1989 and 1999, the Army struggled to meet operations, personnel, and maintenance costs while investing in its future through research and development  and  equipment  procurement.  Funding  for  modernization was hit particularly hard. Modernization funds fell by over 40 percent in the decade leading up to 2001. Fiscal years 1999 and 2000, however, saw increases in expenditures for the Army, and the budget submission for FY 2001 continued this trend (Table 1) .

On 7 February 2000, the Army requested $70.8 billion in total obligation authority from Congress for FY 2001. Army budget planners believed that this amount would fund training programs for active duty units to maintain current readiness levels. The budget, as submitted, would also maintain the active and reserve components at their approved end strengths. Finally, the funding  request,  if  approved,  would  ensure  that  Army  modernization  and Transformation efforts could proceed at their current pace.  The funding of these priorities, however, required reductions in other areas. Rather than reducing funds for quality of life programs and housing improvements, budget planners made cuts in base operations support, which would be kept at the minimum essential level, in order to fund training, personnel, and modernization costs.

In March 2000, General Shinseki defended the budget request before the House Armed Services Committee. He argued that the Army needed more  funding  than  it  had  originally  requested  and  without  additional funds it would have to divert modernization funds to cover the costs of maintaining unit readiness. The chief of staff also requested supplemental appropriations to pay for operations in the Balkans. On 21 May 2001, the Department of Defense submitted a supplemental budget request for FY 2001 that included $971.4 million for the Army to cover costs related to its current operations. Other important issues addressed by the supplemental request included the  Army' s rising military pay and entitlements, dwindling funds  for  reservist  training,  rising  contract  and  program  development costs, and insufficient funds for base operations support and operations

and maintenance accounts. After these and other additions to the Army' s budget, including an additional $1.6 billion for procurement, the Army received $77 billion in total obligation authority by the conclusion of the fiscal year, $2.9 billion over its initial request.

While deliberations continued with Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Defense, the Army began to formulate its budget request for the next fiscal year. Congress received the Army' s FY 2002 budget request on 27 June 2001 (Table 2) . This request totaled $80.2 billion in total obligation authority, an increase of $6 billion over the previous fiscal year' s request. The Army argued that the increase was necessary to fund  modernization  costs  while  maintaining  readiness  and  executing  its current missions. The new budget would keep end strengths for the active duty Army, National Guard, and the Army Reserve at their same levels as the previous fiscal year and maintain rigorous training. Negotiations concerning the next fiscal year' s budget carried on between the Army, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and Congress after FY 2001 ended.

## The Quadrennial Defense Review

The  first  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  took  place  in  1997.  The intent  of  this  congressionally  mandated  process  is  to  align  the  force structure, modernization plans, infrastructure, and budgets of the armed services  with  the  National  Security  Strategy. The Army,  hampered by

a disorganized effort, unclear definitions of its purpose and goals, and internal  divisions  within  the  service  itself,  fared  poorly  in  the  1997 review. The Army had emerged from the deliberations with increased funding  for  modernization,  but  not  with  the  desired  increase  in  force structure and personnel necessary to support the high operational tempo experienced since the end of the Cold War. Instead, the Office of the Secretary  of  Defense  directed  the Army  to  maintain  its  current  force structure, based upon ten active duty divisions, with a smaller number of uniformed and civilian personnel.

The  Army's  senior  leaders  wanted  to  avoid  the  mistakes  of  the previous  review.  One  mistake  had  been  that  the Army  organized  itself only six months before the review took place. For the 2001 review, the Army began to prepare more than a year in advance. In January 2000, the Center for Land Warfare, a small cell remaining from the 1997 Army QDR Office and part of the Office of the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, received additional  personnel  to  form  a  new  office  to  oversee  the  review. Three months later, Brig. Gen. H. Lynn Hartsell was named director and began overseeing  further  growth  and  reorganization  of  the  office.  The  office created seven panels, each led by a general officer and staffed by  Army Staff and Secretariat personnel. The panels' tasks were to consider the Army's plans and policies for the following subjects: strategy, risk assessment, and transformation; force generation capability and structure; modernization; sustainment; strategic mobility and infrastructure; readiness; information superiority;  and  human  resources. At  the  end  of  the  year,  the  enlarged office fell under the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs as part of the realignment of the Army Staff.

Throughout early and mid-2000, the review panels identified thirteen areas of concern and developed a strategy to address them in the impending QDR. At the beginning of FY 2001, after the review panels had completed their work, Army planners solicited advice from defense experts, retired senior  leaders,  and  commanders  of  regional,  unified,  and Army  service component  commands.  General  Hartsell's  office  also  ran  an  extensive analysis of the Army's force structure, demonstrating that further cuts in personnel would reduce its effectiveness.

Despite over a year of preparation, the Army still faced considerable difficulty  during  the  review.  Relations  between  the  Army  and  the  OSD became strained after Donald H. Rumsfeld became secretary of defense in January 2001. Secretary Rumsfeld, often working with little communication or consultation with the armed services, established ten senior review panels of his own, as well as several smaller working groups, to frame his goals and intent for the impending discussions. The Army's argument to preserve its current force structure ran counter to the vision of military transformation endorsed  by  Secretary  Rumsfeld,  who  argued  that  advanced  technology

could supply, if not exceed, many of the capabilities then provided by large land forces. Also, many of the studies and analyses that the Army QDR Office had conducted during the previous administration appeared irrelevant to  the  issues  and  arguments  raised  by  the  civilian  appointees  of  the  new administration. This forced the  Army to react, often in a hasty and improvised manner, to arguments and objections raised by the Office of the Secretary of  Defense.  Finally,  the  Army's  land  power-based  concept  of  military transformation seemed less futuristic than those of the Air Force and Navy, which shared Secretary Rumsfeld's enthusiasm for small, light, and mobile air  and  sea  forces  equipped  with  precision-strike  munitions.  To  redress these problems, in March 2001 General Byrnes directed General Hartsell to reassess his office's procedures and analysis to better accommodate the new issues raised by Secretary Rumsfeld and his subordinates and to create new working panels to prepare Army responses.

After  the  turbulent  preliminary  meetings  between  the  Office  of  the Secretary  of  Defense  and  the  Army  ended,  the  review  began  in  April 2001 and lasted through August. The Director,  OSD Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&amp;E), oversaw the review and directed the services to develop two Program Objective Memorandums (POMs) for fiscal years 2003-2007. The services were to submit both documents and PA&amp;E would use them during program review. The Army Staff briefed both POMs to the secretary of the Army on 10 September 2011. After the attacks of 11 September, the secretary of defense directed the services to use the higher POM as their total obligation authority, leading the Army Staff to rebuild the fiscal years 2003-2007 POM in six weeks.

By  September,  the  review  began  to  take  shape.  A  new  strategic framework  formulated  by  Secretary  Rumsfeld's  office  broke  with  the policies and guidance of the previous administration, which had based the previous QDR on the presumption that the United States should be able to wage two simultaneous major theater wars. The new concept became known as the '1-4-2-1' strategy,  its  name  derived  from  the  number  of missions the U.S. military had to be prepared to perform in order to meet different national security requirements. The 1-4-2-1 strategy articulated the following roles for the U.S. military: homeland defense (1), forward deterrence  in  four  critical  regions  (4),  the  ability  to  'swiftly  defeat  the efforts' of enemy states in two near-simultaneous conflicts (2), and the ability to 'win decisively' in one of them, meaning the total defeat and overthrow of the enemy regime at the president's option in one of those conflicts (1).

The Office of the Secretary of Defense submitted the draft of its QDR report on 24 September 2001 to the Joint Staff, the armed services, and combatant commanders for review. The report addressed fourteen critical issues related to national strategy and assessed each armed service' s ability

to execute that strategy. Each armed service was allowed to return only three  critical  comments.  General  Hartsell' s  office  prepared  the  Army' s response, which noted that responsibilities and requirements for homeland defense were unclear, that the report distorted assessments of the current force against planning scenarios and acceptable risk estimates, and that the report overemphasized the role of long-range precision-strike weaponry. Despite these concerns, the report that Secretary Rumsfeld submitted to Congress on 30 September 2001 was essentially unchanged from the draft of six days prior.

Although contentiousness had marked the process, by the end of the fiscal year the Army considered its effort in the QDR a qualified success. It had preserved its force structure and budget from suggested reductions, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense accepted approximately twothirds of the Army' s recommendations when it prepared the initial draft of the final report.

## Personnel

## Army Strength

The active Army's end strength, established by the National Defense Appropriations Act for FY 2001 stood at 480,000. As of 30 September 2001,  the  actual  number  of  soldiers  in  the  Army  totaled  480,801  and consisted of 400,461 enlisted personnel; 11,350 warrant officers; 64,829 commissioned officers; and 4,161 cadets. Females made up 15.5 percent of the active force, and 41.7 percent were minorities. As an incentive to maintain end strength, the fiscal year budget allowed a 3.7 percent pay increase  and  began  a  six-year  program  to  improve  pay  comparability levels at one-half percent above the national employment cost index to adjust for inflation.

By the end of FY 2001, the Army National Guard was comprised of 351,829 guardsmen. Of these, 315,250 were enlisted personnel and 36,579 were officers. Minorities made up a total of 26.8 percent of the National Guard, and 12.1 percent were female.

The authorized end strength of the Army Reserve for FY 2001 was 205,000. At the end of the fiscal year, the actual end strength of the Army Reserve  stood  at  205,628,  with  164,760  enlisted  personnel  and  40,868 officers. A total of 41.2 percent were minorities, and almost a quarter of reservists were women. The National Defense Authorization Act allowed for  13,106 reservists to serve on full-time active duty or full-time duty during  the  fiscal  year  to  support  the  organization,  administration,  and training of the Army's reserve component.

## Manning Initiatives

In November 1999, General Shinseki created the Manning Task Force within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. The task force was to study the individual replacement system used by the Army to assign soldiers to brigade combat teams and its effects on readiness. At  the  time,  the  Army  manned  and  equipped  its  units  according  to Authorized Levels of Organization, which determined the personnel and assets necessary to fill the unit' s table of organization and equipment. Historically, units with higher Authorized Levels of Organization, such

as  divisions,  Special  Forces,  and  separate  brigades,  received  priority for  personnel,  equipment,  and  other  resources.  This  left  other  units in a degraded state of readiness and less able to deploy for unplanned crises.  General  Shinseki  halted  this  preferential  practice  and  directed that all units should receive 100 percent of their personnel and resource requirements. By the end of FY 2000, the Army was able to man its ten active component divisions and two armored cavalry regiments at a rate of 100 percent. The personnel requirements for these units had been met, but not all soldiers assigned to the units held correct grades and military occupational specialties.

In  FY  2001,  the  Army  took  steps  to  ensure  that  proper  personnel were  assigned  to  these  twelve  units.  By  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  93 percent of the soldiers serving in those units met the correct grade and military  occupational  specialty  requirements  after  the Army  transferred selected soldiers to them from other units. Headquarters elements also saw manning improvements, with particular attention paid to units designated for  deployment  in  the  early  stages  of  major  operations.  Specific  units above the division echelon level that were expected to deploy in the first thirty-five  days  of  a  major  theater  war  achieved  100  percent  personnel rates  during  FY  2001,  with  91  percent  of  their  soldiers  placed  in  the correct grades and military occupational specialties. Manpower restraints, however,  prevented  the Army  from  manning  its  remaining  units  at  100 percent during the fiscal year.

## Enlisted Personnel

Recruiting was a tremendous success for the active duty Army in FY 2001. On 4 September 2001, the Army announced that it had reached its recruiting target of 75,800 new active duty troops and was also on course to meet its reserve component recruiting quotas by the end of the month. By the close of the fiscal year, the Army had exceeded the active duty goal of  75,800 by fifty-five  recruits.  Overall,  these  recruits  met  or  exceeded the  Department  of  Defense' s  three  main  standards  for  intelligence  and aptitude:  possession  of  a  high  school  diploma,  consistent  high  scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), and a low rate of poor scores on the AFQT. Over 90 percent of Army recruits during FY 2001 held high school diplomas. A total of 63.2 percent scored in the upper half of the AFQT, which placed them in the top three of the test' s eight scoring categories. Less than 2 percent of those admitted scored in category IV , the lowest a recruit may score and still remain eligible to enlist.

There were a total of 52,259 enlisted promotion allocations during the fiscal year: 30,081 to sergeant; 13,061 to staff sergeant; 6,421 to sergeant first class; 2,296 to master sergeant; and 400 to sergeant major.

The Army exceeded its annual goals for initial term, mid-career, and career  retention  for  the  fiscal  year.  A  total  of  64,982  soldiers  in  these categories reenlisted, surpassing the quota of 64,000. In a departure from established practice, soldiers were allowed to reenlist up until the date of their separation from the service, as opposed to the previous policy that required soldiers to reenlist no less than ninety days before separation. To keep soldiers with high-demand skills in the civilian workforce, the Army increased  its  payments of  the  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  from  $44 million to $107 million. In addition to these incentives, soldiers serving in South Korea or at eleven stateside installations with low retention rates were eligible for an incentive called the Targeted Selective Reenlistment Bonus. An additional 12,099 soldiers transitioned into the Army Reserve, exceeding the targeted goal by over 1,500.

In  FY  2001,  there  were  a  total  of  85,246  enlisted  separations, including those for retirements and administrative or physical disabilities. The  numbers  of  separations  for  entry-level  performance  and  conduct, nondisability  medical  conditions  interfering  with  performance  of  duty, misconduct,  poor  physical  fitness,  and  homosexual  conduct  increased from fiscal year 2000. However, the numbers of separations for discharges in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial,  hardship  and  dependency,  parenthood, erroneous enlistment, and failure to maintain weight standards decreased from the previous fiscal year.

## Recruiting Programs and Incentives

Improved educational incentives assisted the Army' s recruiting efforts during FY 2001. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel continued its evaluation of two education-based initiatives: College First and GED+ (General Educational Development Diploma Plus). Under the College First Program, the Army enlisted 342 recruits in FY 2001. College First allowed college students to enlist in the Delayed Enlistment Program and to receive a monthly stipend from the Army while attending classes for up to two years. The other pilot program, GED+, assisted promising individuals without high school diplomas who had achieved high scores on  the  AFQT  and  the Army' s Aptitude  for  Individual  Motivation Test. Under the GED+ program, thousands of prospective soldiers enlisted in the active and reserve components and received tutoring and mentoring to help them earn their General Educational Development diplomas before they entered service. The Army also implemented a program called Army University  Access  On-Line,  a  $453  million  program  in  which  twelve private technology companies and twenty-nine accredited higher education institutions  provided  distance  education  to  soldiers.  As  planned,  Army University  Access  On-Line  would  allow  an  estimated  eighty  thousand

soldiers to earn postsecondary degrees and technical certifications through Internet instruction between fiscal years 2001-2006.

A major change in marketing the Army brand accompanied these new educational incentives. More than two decades had passed since the Army unveiled its highly successful 'Be All Y ou Can Be' recruiting campaign in 1980, and Secretary Caldera decided it was time to change the recruiting message. In June 2000, the Army hired three civilian advertising agencies to create a new recruiting campaign. Leo Burnett USA served as the lead of the contracting team, and two minority-owned firms, Cartel Creativo and  IMAGES  USA,  provided  demographic  marketing  strategies  to reach Hispanic and African American audiences. The centerpiece of the campaign was a new slogan, 'An Army of One,' which was intended to emphasize  the  teamwork  and  unity  of  the Army.  On  10  January  2001, the Army announced the new recruiting message and campaign, and the first primetime televised commercial followed the next day. In print and broadcast  advertisements,  soldiers  told  of  the  challenges  and  rewards of service and stressed the wide range of opportunities for personal and professional development within the Army. A redesigned recruiting Web site and streamlined Army logo featuring a white and gold star on a black background accompanied the new advertisements.

## Officer Personnel

Although the accession of enlisted personnel was a success for the Army in FY 2001, accession of officers proved difficult. The Army commissioned a  total  of  5,540  officers  during  the  fiscal  year:  2,955  from  the  Reserve Officers' Training Corps, 930 from the U.S. Military Academy, 752 from Officer Candidate School, and 903 from direct commissions or other means of accession, such as interservice transfers and officers returning to active duty. A total of 938 officers receiving their commission through the Reserve Officers'  Training  Corps  were  nonscholarship  participants.  Further,  the Army struggled to fill the numbers of officers commissioned in its basic branches and specialty areas, adding only 3,979 of the 4,100 new officers needed.

## Army Training and Leader Development Panel

In  FY  2001,  the  Army  continued  with  its  Training  and  Leader Development Panel, a major effort to study and improve the retention of junior officers. General Shinseki had chartered the panel in June 2000 and charged General John N. Abrams, the commanding general of U.S. Army Training  and  Doctrine  Command,  with  its  oversight.  General  Shinseki instructed General Abrams to review the way the Army trained soldiers, developed leaders, and prepared its members to conduct both combat and noncombat missions. The panel met with over 13,500 officers and spouses in  the  first  of  four  planned  research  phases.  During these meetings, the panel members conducted interviews, surveys, and focus groups. Work on future research phases continued into the next fiscal year.

Between  October  and  December  2000,  the  panel  presented  its findings  to  the  chief  of  staff  and  other  general  officers.  The  panel reported  that  respondents  noted  concerns  about  the  housing,  health care,  and  retirement  benefits  provided  by  the  Army  to  soldiers  and their families. The lack of off-duty time for junior officers represented another critical concern. Many junior officers believed that the Army's rigorous  training  programs,  while  effective,  intruded  on  family  and personal time. The panel also identified widespread concerns harbored by  junior  officers  regarding  their  professional  development.  Some officers believed that the development of junior officers was too hurried and that lack of time prevented them from mastering basic tactical and leadership skills. Others judged the officer assignment process to be more  concerned  with  bureaucratic  personnel  management  than  with individual professional development. Not all of the panel's findings, however, were negative. The research also confirmed a strong sense of dedication to the Army and the nation among the officer corps and their families.

The panel completed its research on junior officers in February 2001 and summarized its findings in the Army Training and Leader Development Panel Officer Study Report. This document identified seven major areas as 'imperatives' where the Army would have to make improvements to better recruit,  develop,  and  retain  future  leaders. The  first  imperative  was  the need for senior officers to tolerate errors made by subordinates in order to train soldiers and to develop leaders. The second and third imperatives cited the need to adapt the Officer Education System and the ways that the Army trained its soldiers for missions in the post-Cold War strategic environment.  The  fourth  imperative  proposed  a  need  to  articulate  and enforce  clear  standards  for  success  and  failure  in  training  officers.  To make officers aware that training affected their development as leaders, the fifth imperative expressed the need for a model of officer professional development.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  necessary  changes  identified  or implied by the five preceding imperatives, the sixth imperative charged the Army with developing a management process that could enact changes in training and leader development. The final imperative was to support lifelong  learning,  and  the  panel  called  for  the  continued  educational development  of  officers  throughout  their  careers.  With  its  research  on officers completed, the panel reconstituted itself in April 2001 and began its study of noncommissioned officers.

The  panel  also  submitted  a  list  of  recommendations  to  remedy its  previously  identified  imperatives.  By  May  2001,  the  Army  began implementing the panel's recommendations by altering policies regarding permanent changes of station and changes of command to provide greater stability  to  soldiers'  families.  The  chief  of  staff  directed  that  soldiers should receive more family time on weekends and holidays by restricting garrison activities  and  by  scheduling  four-day  weekends  in  conjunction with  national  holidays.  General  Shinseki  further  directed  that  tasks  not related to combat training be eliminated and that minor tasks with short response times be reduced. To reduce personnel turnover and to provide adequate time to develop leadership skills, lieutenants would spend at least one year leading at the platoon level. Finally, the chief of staff directed U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command to revise Field Manual (FM) 25-100, Training  the  Force ,  and  FM  25-101, Battle  Focused Training . These two field manuals concerned the Army's basic training doctrine and that  doctrine' s  application  to  the  development and execution of training programs, respectively.

The  panel  also  recommended  that  the  Army  should  designate  a single  proponent  for  training  and  leader  development.  Acting  on  this recommendation, General Shinseki transferred the responsibility for leader development from the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel to the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. In July 2001,

the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans approved the establishment of its Leader Development Division, which would begin operations in the next fiscal year.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, Vice Chief of Staff General John M. Keane directed Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude, the deputy chief of staff for personnel, to create the Army Pregnancy and Readiness Working Group to  examine  and  reduce  the  effects  of  unintended  pregnancies  on Army readiness.  The  working  group  included  representatives  from  the  Office of the Surgeon General, the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, and Human Resource Policy Directorate of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. The working group reviewed the pregnancy policies of each armed service and other documents to help shape a new Army policy based on dignity, respect, and individual responsibility. This new policy, which was still under development at the end of FY 2001, included instructions for handling the impact of sexual behavior and pregnancy on individual soldiers and the Army in general, as well as improved physical training for pregnant and postpartum soldiers.

## Civilians

Civilians continued to play an important role in the Army, although there  was  a  slight  decrease  of  0.2  percent  in  the  number  of  direct-hire civilians from the previous fiscal year. The Army employed 204,506 directhire  civilians  during  2001,  a  total  of  591  less  than  in  fiscal  year  2000. Indirect hires of foreign nationals in Germany, the Republic of Korea, and other nations also decreased by approximately 293 in 2001 to a total of 17,875. Like their uniformed counterparts, Army civilians also received a  3.7  percent  pay  raise  in  FY  2001. To  redress  the  shortage  of  civilian employees, the FY 2002 budget request submitted in June 2001, called for an increased direct-hire civilian workforce of 215,600.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## The Interim Force

On  12  October  1999,  Secretary  Caldera  and  General  Shinseki released  a  document  entitled The  Army  Vision . In  this  important statement, the two senior leaders of the Army declared that the service would  have  to  adapt  itself  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  post-Cold War world. Since World War II, the Army had prepared to deter Soviet aggression in Europe and, if necessary, wage a large-scale conventional war  against  an  enemy  that  used  similar  equipment,  organizations, and  tactics.  After  its  resounding  victory  over  Iraq  in  1991  with Operation Desert storm , the Army found itself responsible for smaller peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Haiti, and the Balkans. To improve the Army's ability to conduct rapid deployments to such missions while retaining  its  superiority  in  future  conventional  conflicts,  Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki explained in The Army Vision that  the Army would need to develop and retain leaders and to provide a high quality of life for soldiers while remaining ready to respond to a wide variety  of  missions.  Secretary  Caldera  and  General  Shinseki  also called  for  a  transformation  of  the Army  with The Army Vision .  The Army of the future, they wrote, should be composed of smaller and easily deployable units able to respond more rapidly and effectively to a greater number of missions than the current Army's heavy and light units. Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki sought to ensure that the Army of the future could fight from a position of dominance, maintain the initiative throughout engagements, and defeat any and all enemies decisively.

By  the  end  of  1999,  General  Shinseki  had  given  further  details as  to  how  the  service  would  transform  itself  with  the  release  of  the Transformation Campaign Plan. Developed by the Army Transformation Office, a cell within the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans' Directorate of Strategic Plans and Policy, the Transformation Campaign Plan identified three forces the Army would employ during Transformation. The first was the Army's current force, called the Legacy Force, which could be trained and ready to meet conventional challenges.

The second, the Interim Force, would use technological improvements to provide the quick-response and limited logistical requirements of the Army's light forces with the firepower and survivability of the Army's armored  units.  The  final  force,  the  Objective  Force,  would  employ Future Combat Systems, a suite of aerial and ground sensors, unmanned attack systems, and futuristic combat vehicles linked by an information network. The Objective Force, as Secretary Caldera and General Shinseki described it, would provide the capabilities outlined in The Army Vision .

The year after the release of The Army Vision ,  the Transformation plan called for a new force, the Initial Force. The Initial Force would serve as a bridge between the Legacy and Interim Forces and test new doctrine, organizations, and technology.  To  establish  the  Initial  Force  the  3d  Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, which were stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington, were reorganized and given new  equipment  in April  2000.  Designated  as  Initial  Brigade  Combat Teams, the two units were reorganized into a novel brigade structure of five battalions: three mechanized infantry; one artillery; and, in order to provide increased intelligence-gathering equipment and capabilities to the brigade, one reconnaissance, surveillance, targeting, and acquisition battalion. In addition to testing the new organizational structure, the two reconfigured  brigades  also  experimented  with  existing  light  armored vehicles  and  equipment  that  could  be  bought  commercially  to  avoid the  lengthy  delays  and  costs  required  by  internal  development  of  new materiel.

The lessons learned from the experiments at Fort Lewis led the Army to purchase a new combat vehicle for equipping the Interim Force. After conducting a series of tests at Fort Knox, Kentucky, on 16 November 2000 the Army awarded a contract for the production of the Interim Armored Vehicle to GM GDLS Defense Group, a joint venture of General Motors and  General  Dynamics  Land  Systems.  The  Interim  Armored  Vehicle was not a single vehicle but a series of vehicles designed in two main variants. The first of these was the Mobile Gun System, which would be armed with a 105-mm. gun to provide direct-fire support for infantry. The second variant, the Infantry Carrier Vehicle, could hold a crew of two and nine soldiers with their equipment. The Infantry Carrier Vehicle would  provide  the  prototype  for  eight  further  variants,  which  would enter production in 2003. The Interim Armored Vehicle could reach a maximum speed of sixty miles per hour and travel three hundred miles on a single load of fuel. Lighter than other armored vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, they could also be airlifted by C-130s or larger aircraft. With a common chassis and interchangeable parts, the vehicles required simpler maintenance and repair and had less logistical constraints than the Army's other armored vehicles.

The contract with GM GDLS Defense Group called for the construction of 2,131 vehicles over a six-year period at a cost of $4 billion, with initial delivery to begin in 2001. This first delivery would consist of more than three hundred vehicles, enough to outfit one of the brigades at Fort Lewis. The contract called for enough vehicles to equip the six Initial Brigade Combat Teams by FY 2006. A competing firm filed a protest against the contract shortly after it was made public, causing a delay of almost four months. On 9 April 2001, the Government Accountability Office rejected the protest and upheld the award to GM GDLS Defense Group.

The  organization  of  the  Initial  Force  Brigade  Combat Team  and  the selection of the Interim Armored Vehicle put into place two elements that would be central to the successful development of the Interim Force. The Interim  Force  would  be  able  to  deploy  six  to  eight  brigades  worldwide within ninety-six hours if given adequate strategic airlift. The  two  Initial Brigade Combat Teams at Fort Lewis became the first element of this force. One of the brigades was expected to be ready for deployment in FY 2003, and the other in the following fiscal year. Plans called for the Initial Force to be joined by another six to eight brigades equipped with Interim Armored Vehicles. On 12 July 2001, the Army announced that three active component brigades and one reserve component brigade would be the next four units to begin converting to Interim Brigade Combat Teams. This group consisted of the 172d Infantry Brigade; the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment; the 2d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division; and the Pennsylvania National Guard' s 56th Brigade,  28th  Infantry  Division. The  establishment  and  equipping  of  the Interim Brigade Combat Team represented the first successful step toward realizing the transformation of the Army outlined in The Army Vision .

## The Objective Force

The  Objective  Force  described  in The  Army  Vision remained  a future  goal  in  FY  2001,  to  be  reached  within  eight  to  ten  years.  In addition to the Interim Force's ability to deploy brigades within ninetysix hours, The Army Vision required that the Objective Force be able to deploy a division within 120 hours and five divisions within thirty days. The Objective Force would be based on the development and fielding of  Future  Combat  Systems,  a  planned  family  of  vehicles  that  would use  advanced  technology  and  be  more  capable  than  existing  combat vehicles. The Army entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in February 2000 to fund  and  develop  Future  Combat  Systems.  Future  Combat  Systems would provide a means to deliver the striking power and survivability of heavy forces with the mobility of light forces described in The Army Vision .

To provide institutional momentum behind Transformation, Secretary White  and  General  Shinseki  placed  Lt.  Gen.  Joseph  M.  Cosumano  Jr. in command of a new office, the Future Combat Systems Task Force, in October 2000. Six months later, General Shinseki ordered that the task force' s responsibilities be broadened, and it became the Objective Force Task  Force.  General  Shinseki  also  directed  the  expanded  task  force  to develop  Future  Combat  Systems  into  an  acquisition  program,  to  set benchmark dates for the deliveries of critical technologies, and to ensure that  Future  Combat  Systems  programs  would  deliver  the  capabilities required  for  the  Objective  Force.  With  its  charter  expanded,  the  task force also served as the chief of staff' s liaison for Transformation-related issues  with  Congress,  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Joint Staff,  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Programs  Agency,  subordinate commands  within  the Army,  and  various  private  corporations  involved with the development of Future Combat Systems. After Lt. Gen. John M. Riggs  succeeded  General  Cosumano  as  director  in  June  2001,  the  task force began preparing a detailed campaign plan to describe and define the purpose, missions, and capabilities of the Objective Force. The study was released in FY 2002.

The growing organizational support placed behind the Army Transformation program was not the only sign of the growing resources required  to realize the ambitious  goal  of  the  Objective  Force.  To accommodate the growing fiscal demands of Transformation, the Army restructured  its  budget  to  offset  the  costs  of  planning,  testing,  and development. To help pay for the development of Future Combat Systems and other Transformation programs, the Army restructured the Crusader self-propelled howitzer and Future Scout and Cavalry System in the FY 2001 budget. Additional budget changes for the fiscal year included the

divestiture  of  seven  major  weapons  systems  and  reallocation  of  their funding to other programs for Future Combat Systems. These restructures and budget cuts provided over $11.2 billion that could be reprogrammed between fiscal years 2001 and 2014.

## Army Aviation

As the Army planned for its future armored ground vehicles, it also unveiled  a  plan  to  modernize  and  recapitalize  its  present  aircraft  fleet during  FY  2001. Army  aviation  had  been  a  major  concern  of  General Shinseki  since  1999,  when  two  events  highlighted  shortcomings  in  the Army's ability to field an effective aerial force. Task Force Hawk , which included two battalions of AH-64 Apache helicopters, performed poorly in Albania, exposing a shortage of trained pilots, experienced leaders, and maintenance  and  equipment  assets.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  entire  UH-1 Iroquois  and AH-1  Cobra  fleets  of  the  National  Guard  were  grounded because of widespread maintenance and reliability issues.

To address the problems with its rotary-wing fleet, in April 2000 the Army announced a new version of its Aviation Modernization Plan. The new plan was the result of a two-year effort to modernize the  Army' s rotarywing aviation  assets  and  intended  to  reduce  maintenance,  training,  and operating costs. It proposed a reduction in the different types of helicopters used by the Army, along with the Army Reserve and National Guard, from seven to four: the AH-64 Apache, the CH-47 Chinook, the UH-60 Black Hawk,  and  the  under-development  RAH-66  Comanche. The  plan  also endorsed the creation of multifunctional battalions. Composed of multiple types of helicopters, these units would be smaller but more capable than the  current  single-airframe  battalions  used  by  the  Army.  In  December 2000, Vice Chief of Staff General John M. Keane created a task force to execute an aviation modernization program that would maintain readiness while divesting obsolete aircraft from the active and reserve component fleets. The task force was chaired by Brig. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, head of the Force Management Directorate in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. After two weeks of deliberation, the task force suggested minor changes to the current aviation plan.

After taking the task force' s recommendations into account, the Army announced its revised Aviation Modernization Plan on 7 September 2001. It called for all UH-1 Iroquois and AH-1 Cobra helicopters to be retired from service by 2004, when only the AH-64 Apache, UH-60 Black Hawk, OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, and CH-47 Chinook would be in service. The plan also  reduced  the  number  of  aircraft  by  over  four  hundred  in  the  active component and six hundred in the reserve component between fiscal years 2001 and 2007. This reduction of almost a quarter of the Army' s aircraft

would  allow  the  Army  to  fund  the  recapitalization  and  modernization of  its  remaining  helicopters. The Army' s  aviation  capabilities  were  also reorganized,  with  the  majority  of  its  attack  aircraft  placed  in  smaller battalions  within  the  active  component  and  the  majority  of  its  lift  and support aircraft placed in the Army Reserve and National Guard. A total of 240 aircraft were moved from active to reserve units. The reorganization and reduction in the number of aircraft units provided more repair and maintenance assets to a fewer number of aircraft needing service. Planners predicted  that  these  improvements  in  equipping,  maintaining,  training, manning, and funding would raise the operational readiness rate of the Army's aviation units from 75 percent to 90 percent within three years.

The  Aviation  Modernization  Plan  dealt  not  only  with  the  Army' s present  inventory  of  rotary-wing  aircraft, but also with  the future technological development of Army aviation. Procurement of the RAH66 Comanche reconnaissance helicopter played an important part in the Aviation  Modernization  Plan. The  Comanche,  the  centerpiece  of Army aviation modernization, was expected to be the first fielded system of the Objective Force. The FY 2001 budget funded the testing of two prototypes and the development of an engine and other related systems to support the Comanche. With the release of the modernization plan and continuing development of the Comanche, the Army moved toward its goal of fielding a capable and more easily supportable aviation component.

## Technological Transformation and Testing

While developing long-term programs such as Future Combat Systems and the Comanche, the Army also began to bring new technologies into the field for testing during FY 2001. At Fort Irwin, California, the 2d and 4th Brigades of the 4th Infantry Division conducted a two-week exercise called the Division Capstone Exercise in April 2001. The exercise included the final test of Army Battle Command Systems, a networked suite of six technologies  that  integrated  information  systems  between  tactical  and strategic  echelons.  The  Advanced  Field  Artillery  Tactical  Data  System coordinated artillery missions and assigned target priorities to the artillery crews linked with the system. The All Source Analysis System processed intelligence and could transmit it from echelons above corps down to the battalion level.  The Maneuver Control System distributed electronic tactical reports and orders between commanders and subordinate units. The Air and Missile Defense Work Station delivered early warning and targeting information  for  air  defense.  The  Combat  Service  Support  Computer System provided commanders with logistical information. The final piece of the Army Battle Command Systems, the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below, was a distributed tactical internet that could broadcast

locations of friendly and enemy vehicles. When combined, the six systems promised to deliver improved awareness of battlefield conditions and an increased ability to spread information between levels of command.

The  Division  Capstone  Exercise  demonstrated  that  Army  Battle Command  Systems  improved  the  amount  of  information  available  to commanders, thereby giving them greater ability to maneuver their units and  make  swift  decisions.  Also,  at  lower  echelons  the  better-informed soldiers displayed greater initiative than the opposing force. The success of  the Army' s  first  'digital  division'  in  the  Division  Capstone  Exercise added momentum to existing plans to digitize the remaining units of the III Corps by FY 2004.

The lessons learned from the Division Capstone Exercise became part of a subsequent war game designed to evaluate the Army's technological transformation efforts intended for the Objective Force. Shortly after the exercise at Fort Irwin ended, the Army held its Army Transformation War Game at the Army War College from 22 to 27 April 2001. Headquarters, Department of the Army, sent representatives, as did U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Materiel Command, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, U.S. Army Intelligence  and  Security  Command,  U.S.  Army  Medical  Department Center and School, U.S. Army Science Board, and U.S. Army Research Laboratory.  Additionally,  participants  from  the  other  armed  services and  Department  of  Defense  commands  and  offices,  three  executive departments, eight federal intelligence agencies, and eight allied armies also contributed to the events.  The war game, named Vigilant warriors 01 , incorporated lessons learned from the Division Capstone Exercise, as well as from the Joint Contingency Force Advanced Warfighting Experiment held in September 2001 at Fort Polk, Louisiana. The scenario of Vigilant warriors 01 involved  a  major  theater  war  in  the  Middle  East  in  2015 and  envisioned  a  Blue  Force  of  U.S.  armed  forces,  other  governmental agencies,  and  multinational  partners  fighting  against  an  unconventional enemy employing both  regular  and  irregular  tactics  to  offset American technological and materiel advantages. The scenario also contained events to test the Blue Force' s ability to respond to noncombat crises and conduct operations after combat had ended.

The  victory  of  the  Blue  Force  in  three  simulations  suggested  to observers  that  the  Objective  Force,  as  currently  planned,  would  be capable of deploying rapidly and defeating a variety of opposing forces. Throughout the war game, the Blue Force was able to strike unexpectedly and  overwhelmingly  at  the  opposing  force,  disrupting  the  ability  of opposing commanders to control and maneuver their units. The war game, however, also suggested that further study would need to be conducted in several areas, including training, leader development, communications,

information collection, logistics, and the provision of air- and sealift. A Senior  Leader  Seminar,  attended  by  the  chief  of  staff  and  other  senior leaders from the Army, the other armed services, and the Department of Defense, followed the war game to disseminate and discuss its findings. Although the war game raised issues for further study, the Army announced that it had demonstrated the value of ongoing Transformation efforts.

## Doctrine

To align its doctrine with its technological and structural transformation, the Army released two new versions of field manuals that laid  out  its  methods  of  waging  war  and  preserving  peace.  On  14  June 2001, Field Manual 100-1, The Army , was replaced by FM 1, The Army . FM 1 provided the basic doctrine for the use of land power in warfare to support the National Security Strategy and National Military Strategy. The new field manual described the fundamental reasons for the Army's existence and the basic functions it bore responsibility for in defending the United States. The authors of the manual took care to make sure it could be understood by a wide audience, including political decision-makers, members of the other armed services,  and  Department  of  Defense  and Department of the Army civilians.

Accompanying FM 1 was FM 3-0, Operations . FM 3-0 represented the  most  comprehensive  change  in  the  Army' s  combat  doctrine  since 1982 with the adoption of AirLand Battle, which envisioned large-scale conventional  operations  against  an  armored  and  mechanized  enemy,  in FM  100-5, Operations .  By  incorporating  experience  from  the  Army' s post-Cold War deployments and engagements, including joint operations with the other armed services, the authors created a new manual including combat and peacekeeping operations to replace the updated 1993 version of FM 100-5. FM 3-0 established the concept of a 'full-spectrum force' capable of executing a wide variety of missions. It divided operations into four major categories: offense, defense, stability, and support operations. Together, FM 1 and FM 3-0 laid the doctrinal and intellectual foundation for an Army capable of operating with the other armed services to protect and advance the nation' s strategic interests.

## The Black Beret

A controversial part of General Shinseki' s Transformation efforts was his decision to adopt the black beret as the  Army' s standard headgear, which he announced on 17 October 2000 at the Association of the United States Army conference. The previous year, U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command  had  begun  studying  the  beret  as  a  means  of  overcoming

parochialisms of branch and specialty.  Accordingly, the command surveyed a wide range of active and retired officers and soldiers to learn what they thought of the idea. The survey results suggested that resistance to the idea would be  pronounced. Although  designed  to  reinforce  the  fundamental point that all soldiers share the same sense of purpose, duty, and sacrifice, the initiative indeed encountered a great deal of resistance. Serving and retired members of the Ranger and Special Forces communities, as well as organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, strongly objected to the idea that all soldiers should wear the same beret. The Office of the Chief of Staff received hundreds of letters and over  a  thousand  e-mails,  mostly  registering  opposition  to  the  idea. The controversy over the beret also invited official scrutiny. Within five months, seventy-one congressional legislators had submitted 112 inquiries to the Office of the Chief of Staff. The White House also requested information. As a result of the uproar, General Shinseki agreed to modify his plan. On 16 March, an announcement that Rangers would be authorized to wear a  distinctive  tan  beret  helped  to  ameliorate  criticism,  and  instructions that soldiers in airborne and Special Forces units would continue to wear maroon and green berets, respectively, followed.

The  berets  began  to  appear  at  central  issue  facilities  and  supply distribution  centers  in  April  2001.  Many  had  to  be  returned,  however, after the politically awkward revelation that some of the berets had been made in China or with Chinese content. Nevertheless, soldiers who had completed entry-level training began wearing the black beret on 14 June 2001. Soldiers entering units after that date had to first complete initialentry training and qualify in weapons and physical training before earning the right to wear the beret. They would then receive their beret in a 'rites of passage' ceremony. Three-fourths of the Army received two pieces of the new headgear by the end of the fiscal year, and the remaining quarter received them in the following fiscal year. The estimated cost of this first issue of two berets per soldier was $26.6 million between fiscal years 2001 and 2002.

## Training

Between fiscal years 1998 and 2000, the Army realigned $1.1 billion dedicated to armor training, in order to fund other programs, and failed to meet tank-mile training goals by an average of 20 percent. In FY 2001, members  of  Congress,  concerned  about  training  tempo,  recommended that  the  Army  develop  a  new  methodology  to  determine  its  funding requirements for training. The Army' s senior leaders responded by making changes  to  its  business  practices.  During  FY  2001,  major  commands began to execute the ground operating tempo and the Flying Hour Program

at  the  levels  specified  in  command  audit  trails  and  in  accordance  with the Army's  Combined Arms Training  Strategy.  Major  commands  could request  permission  to  realign  funds,  but  none  of  these  requests  were approved during the fiscal year. To ensure adherence to the new policy, major  commands  submitted  quarterly  projections  for  the  fiscal  year  to Headquarters, Department of the Army, for scrutiny and approval. At the end of each quarter, expenditures of funds and the training miles and hours performed  by  the  major  commands  would  be  compared  to  projections, with explanations provided in the case of deviations of plus or minus 5 percent from quarterly projections.

While  attempts  to  improve  training  occurred  at  the  HQDA  level, commanders also worked to improve the quality of reporting in the Unit Level  Logistics  System,  the  basis  for  tracking  and  reporting  time  and expenditures related to training. As a result of the new scrutiny on tracking and  expending  training  dollars  and  a  renewed  command  emphasis  on reporting  the  execution  of  the  Combined Arms Training  Strategy  in  an accurate manner, the Army met its ground training goal and achieved 787 tank  miles  during  FY  2001,  the  most  executed  since  Operation  D esert storm .

Resource  and  policy  decisions  made  in  FY  2001  affected  the president' s budget for the next fiscal year, as well as the construction of the Program Objective Memorandum for fiscal years 2003-2007. When constructing  the  Army' s  POM  submission  for  fiscal  years  2003-2007, the  Army  decided  to  accept  significant  risk  to  training  readiness.  The Training Program Execution Group reduced several programs below the presidential budget' s funding level in order to increase funding in other programs and fix readiness problems identified by unit status reports and POM submissions from major commands.

## Deployed Operational Forces

Throughout FY 2001, the Army conducted missions and deployments outside  of  the  continental  United  States.  During  the  year,  approximately 125,000  soldiers  and  15,000  Department  of  the  Army  civilians  were stationed or deployed overseas to meet the Army' s global commitments. The most critical of these commitments was the Army' s ongoing rotation of units to  participate  in  Operation Joint  Forge ,  the  multinational  peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The rotation under way when the fiscal year began was historic because it marked the first time since World War II that a reserve component unit served as an operational headquarters for active duty  units. That  distinction  fell  to  the  headquarters  of  the  49th Armored Division, a Texas Army National Guard unit, which had replaced the 10th Mountain Division in March 2000 as the headquarters for troops serving in

Brig. Gen. Robert L. Halverson, commander of the 49th Armored Division, and General Shinseki

<!-- image -->

Multi-National Division-North of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Stabilization Force. Based in Tuzla, the Multi-National DivisionNorth  bore  the  responsibility  for  peacekeeping  in  northeastern  BosniaHerzegovina. After assuming command of Multi-National Division-North, the soldiers of the 49th Armored Division and the active duty 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment, which reported to the 49th Armored Division, conducted peacekeeping and civil-military operations. These operations contributed to greater security in the region and allowed for a successful legislative election in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 11 November 2000.

The  election  was the  high  point  of  the  49th  Armored  Division' s rotation  in  the  Balkans.  On  5  October  2000,  its  command  of  MultiNational Division-North came to an end, and command transferred to the headquarters of the 3d Infantry Division. The 3d Infantry Division held responsibility for the command until October 2001. Between October 2000 and April 2001, Multi-National Division-North included troops from two National Guard brigades, the 30th Infantry Brigade from North Carolina and the 45th Infantry Brigade from Oklahoma, and troops from the active duty 25th Infantry Division. Units from the Georgia National Guard' s 48th Infantry Brigade joined active duty units from the 3d and 25th Infantry Divisions in April and remained in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the remainder of FY 2001.

In December 2000, General Shinseki approved a schedule to assign a mix of active, reserve, and National Guard units to six-month rotations in the Stabilization Force or the smaller Kosovo Force. General Shinseki concluded  that  enlarging  the  number  of  units  eligible  for  duty  in  the Balkans would allow returning units greater time to train before subsequent deployments. Also,  he  believed  that  serving  together  would  strengthen the relationships between active and reserve component units. To realize these benefits, the schedule called for Army National Guard divisions to command six of the next eight Stabilization Force rotations, which were planned through April 2005. It also called for active duty troops from the III Corps, the V Corps, and the XVIII Airborne Corps to command the Kosovo Force for rotations planned through May 2005.

As the troops of the Stabilization Force kept the peace in the Balkans, another  sixty-two  thousand  soldiers  served  in  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  and the Seventh Army. In addition to the soldiers serving in Multi-National Division-North, troops from U.S. Army, Europe, served in the Balkans under the auspices of NATO. The 21st Theater Support Command oversaw the transit of personnel, equipment, and supplies through Burgas, Bulgaria, en route to Kosovo, Macedonia, and Greece, to support the NATO mission in eastern Europe. While providing forces for these missions, U.S. Army, Europe, also conducted a major aviation training exercise in Poland called Victory strike , which tested pilots and air crews in attack and logistical missions simulations.

In addition to its soldiers in Europe, the Army also had thousands of troops active in the Middle East. An Army infantry battalion and a support battalion  provided  the  core  of  the  Multi-National  Force  and  Observers contingent responsible for peacekeeping  along  the Sinai Peninsula border between Egypt and Israel. More importantly, the Army continued to  maintain  a  forward  presence  in  the  Persian  Gulf  by  contributing approximately three thousand troops to Coalition Joint Task Force-Kuwait at Camp Doha, Kuwait. The combined joint task force oversaw an ongoing training  cycle  called  Operation Desert  spring ,  in  which  four  armored and cavalry brigades from the Army trained alongside the Kuwaiti Army, tangibly demonstrating the commitment of the United States to a secure and stable Middle East.

## Army National Guard

## Organizational Change

In  the  FY  2001  National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  Congress elevated the positions of director of the Army National Guard and chief of the Army Reserve. On 13 June 2001, Maj. Gen. Roger C. Shultz of the National Guard and Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Plewes of the Army Reserve were both promoted to lieutenant general, the first in their positions to hold that rank. These promotions recognized the increasing importance of  the  reserve  component,  as  evidenced  by  the  growing  reliance  on guardsmen and reservists for overseas deployments to Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Middle East.

## Personnel Management

The  Army  National  Guard  met  its  end-strength  objective  of 350,526,  finishing  the  fiscal  year  with  an  end  strength  of  351,829. Enlisted gains were programmed at 60,252, and officer gains at 3,175. The  National  Guard  surpassed  its  recruiting  quota  during  the  fiscal year.  It  enlisted  61,956  new  guardsmen, exceeding the 60,252 target goal by 1,704. Taken as a group, the National Guard recruits met the two aforementioned Department of Defense quality standards related to the AFQT, but the number of high school graduates came in slightly below  expectation.  National  Guard  recruiters,  however,  judged  the group  to  be  the  best  in  a  decade,  and  seasonal  and  targeted  bonus payments helped to fill several critical military occupational specialty shortages in the National Guard. The Guard set its non-prior-service and prior-service accession targets at equivalent 50 percent ratios for the  fiscal  year,  but  the  resulting  rates  showed  an  imbalance  of  53.4 percent  non-prior-service  and  46.6  percent  prior-service  accessions. The Army National Guard continued to lead the reserve components of the armed services with a 10 percent overall attrition rate. The Guard finished the fiscal year with its officer accessions at 107 percent of the goal of 3,175 but ended the year short 821 total officers due to higher than expected loss rates.

## Training and Readiness

The overall unit resources and training levels of the Army National Guard  declined  by  .9  percent  during  FY  2001.  The  primary  causes for this decline were mobilizations in the wake of the terrorist attacks of  11  September  2001  and  a  shortage  of  personnel.  Fourteen  of  the Army National Guard's enhanced separate brigades met their required readiness criteria  as  defined  by  Defense  Planning  Guidance,  and  the equipment on hand for these units increased by 7 percent during the fiscal  year.  Army  National  Guard  divisions,  however,  declined  in readiness due to lack of full-time support personnel. Postmobilization training  levels  and  overall  readiness  for  these  units  remained  below acceptable levels. During the fiscal year, the overall unit resources and training levels for the eight Army National Guard divisions declined by  5.1  percent  because  of  decreases  in  skill  qualification  levels, maintenance, and training.

Despite  these  difficulties,  over  forty  thousand  soldiers  deployed  to the  various  combat  training  centers  to  conduct  Army  National  Guard training  rotations  or  in  support  of  active  component  training  rotations. The Army  National  Guard's Training  Strategy  dictates  that  each  of  its eight  combat  divisions  complete  a  Battle  Command  Training  Program rotation  every  four  years. The  Battle  Command Training  Program  is  a computer-based simulation exercise designed to hone command and staff skills,  the  military  decision-making  process,  and  integration  of  combat assets into a realistic division-level battle. It consists of a five-day seminar followed by an exercise. In FY 2001, the 40th and 42d Infantry Divisions completed the combination seminar and computer exercise at the Army National  Guard  Leadership  Development  Center  in  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas. Approximately four thousand guardsmen from the two divisions participated in Battle Command Training Program exercises in FY 2001. In addition to the division-level Battle Command Training Program, eight National Guard enhanced separate brigades conducted training rotations related  to  the  Brigade  Command  and  Battle  Staff Training  Program,  a brigade-level exercise.

## Mobilization

During FY 2001, the National Guard continued to provide support to  civil  authorities  in  emergency  and  crisis  situations.  State  or  local governments requested National Guard assistance 312 times to deal with natural  disasters,  terrorist  attacks,  or  other  situations.  Guard  members served a total of 236,179 man-days on state-active duty status throughout the year to meet these demands.

The majority of events requiring governors to request assistance from the National Guard were natural disasters. Flood relief efforts represented the primary reason for activation of the Guard, resulting in 67,569 mandays on state-active duty. Major flooding in West Virginia, caused by a series of four deluges throughout the year, required guardsmen from four states to put in 48,100 man-days on state-active duty. Additionally, floods that broke out in the wake of Tropical Storm Allison in June 2001 affected coastal  areas  in  Texas,  Louisiana,  and  Florida.  The  cities  of  Houston, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were particularly hard hit, as were areas  of  southeastern Texas,  where  approximately  1,200 Army  and Air Guard members conducted air and ground search and rescue missions.

Firefighting  continued  to  be  another  major  service  provided  by  the National Guard. In the first six months of 2001, the Florida Guard spent 6,431man-days  helping  local  authorities  fight  a  series  of  wildfires  in that state. Over one-half million acres of land in ten western states were consumed by wildfires in August 2001, and the Guard put in 29,959 mandays fighting the blazes alongside 21,000 civilian firefighters.

In addition to  flood  and  fire  emergencies,  members  of  the  Army  National Guard  also  provided  civil  defense  and  security  when  political  unrest threatened public order. Two notable National Guard call-ups occurred in the nation' s capital during January 2001. Over a thousand guardsmen and air guardsmen contributed to the orderly inauguration of President George W. Bush, providing security and communications support. Less orderly were the organized protests and demonstrations aimed at disrupting the International Monetary Fund conference in Washington, D.C. To support the conference, the District of Columbia National Guard provided security, manned traffic control points, and stood ready to respond in case armed force became necessary. Less than three weeks before the fiscal year ended, the  terrorist  attacks  of  11  September  2001  caused  activations  of  Guard members throughout the country. The attack on the Pentagon resulted in the deployment of Guard members from the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and South Carolina to the scene, while the New Y ork National Guard responded to the site of the collapsed World Trade Center buildings.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The  modernization  of  the Army  National  Guard's  combat  vehicles continued  during  FY  2001. Three  infantry  battalions  in Army  National Guard divisions received the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, and seven  divisional  armored  battalions  received  the  M1A1  Abrams  main battle tank. The Guard also fielded eighteen artillery battalions equipped with  the  M109A6  Paladin  howitzer  system.  Nine  of  these  battalions

were fielded to echelons above division units: eight to enhanced separate brigades, and the ninth to a divisional battalion. Three artillery battalions also received the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System, which was the first component of the Army Battle Command System acquired by the Guard. The National Guards of four states fielded Avenger air defense artillery battalions, continuing the Army National Guard's plan to replace its obsolete Hawk and Chaparral air defense systems with the Avenger.

One materiel issue facing the National Guard in FY 2001 was the lack of surplus inventory of selected items to provide immediate replacements when units sent equipment to depots for repair. This resulted in degraded readiness  as  units  waited  for  equipment  to  return  from  depots  after maintenance and service. The amount of items sent by National Guard units to depots for repair increased by 11 percent during the fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in maintenance requirements for the Guard's aging tactical wheeled vehicle fleet and aviation modernization upgrades. Inadequate funds to support the increased workload of depot maintenance resulted  in  a  backlog  of  unserviceable  equipment.  The Army  National Guard's depot maintenance programs were funded at only 77 percent of the required amount during the fiscal year. Early deploying units, such as the enhanced separate brigades, received 80 percent of their maintenance funding requirements, and the Guard's divisional units received only 74 percent of theirs for the fiscal year.

## Single Stock Fund

The Army continued to implement the Single Stock Fund program, which was first approved in 1997. The Single Stock Fund program is a business  process  reengineering  initiative  designed  to  integrate  logistics and inventory accounting processes in the Army Working Capital Fund, Supply Management-Army business area. The program merged wholesale and retail elements below the HQDA level into a single nationally managed element. During FY 2001, the program moved from the planning stage to  implementation, reaching the first two of its three planned milestone objectives. On 18 October 2000, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics announced that work would begin on reaching Milestone 1, the  conversion of installation-level, retail stock-funded inventories, and Milestone 2, the conversion of corps and theater operations and maintenance retention stocks. Completed by April 2001, the Army managed to merge 91,164 lines of materiel valued in excess of $489 million. The program also  capitalized  former  retail  stock-funded  inventories  valued  at  $451 million and former corps and theater operations and maintenance retention inventories valued at $38 million.

During FY 2001, the Army coordinated planning for Milestone 3, which would extend the Single Stock Fund to tactical supply support activities at division, nondivision, and regimental levels. After initial testing  of  software  and  communications  systems,  the  Milestone  3 operational test was scheduled to begin at Fort Hood, Texas, in June 2002  and  would  involve  the  1st  Cavalry  Division,  the  4th  Infantry Division,  the  Texas  Army  National  Guard,  and  selected  U.S.  Army Reserve activities.

## Recapitalization

As the funding for Army modernization decreased during the 1990s, the service began to search for ways to extend the service life of its aging equipment, vehicles, and weapons systems. To this end, in April 2001, the Army established the Army Recapitalization Program. The program would extend the service life of selected weapons systems, vehicles,

and equipment while reducing their operating and support costs and improving their reliability and ease of maintenance. Recapitalization included  the  rebuilding  or  replacement  of  engines,  transmissions, hydraulics, and wiring systems, as well as the improvement of weapons, sensors, and other technological systems.

In  FY  2001,  the  program  selected  twenty-one Army  systems  for recapitalization, including the M1 Abrams tank; AH-64 A/D Apache/ Longbow helicopters; UH-60  Black Hawk  helicopter; CH-47F Chinook cargo helicopter; M88A1/M88A2 Hercules recovery vehicle; M48/M60  armored  vehicle-launched  bridge;  M9  armored  combat earthmover; M2/M3 series Bradley fighting vehicles; Multiple-launch rocket system; Patriot missile system; M113 family of vehicles; heavy expanded-mobility tactical truck; small emplacement excavator; M915 A4 line haul tractor; AN/TPQ-36/37 Firefinder; AN/ASM-190 electronic  shop  shelter  (includes  AN/ASM-146, AN/ASM-147,  and AN/ASM-189);  M992  field  artillery  ammunition  support  vehicle; D7F/G tractor,  full  track;  small-unit  support  vehicle;  scraper,  earthmoving; and the high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle. Of these twenty-one  systems,  funding  existed  to  begin  the  recapitalization  of only the first sixteen in FY 2002, leading the Army to examine options for  increasing  or  reprogramming  funds  to  recapitalize  the  remaining five vehicles. Scheduled to begin in FY 2002, priority for equipment recapitalization  would  be  given  to  the  headquarters  of  the  III  Corps (including  both  the  active  and  reserve  echelon-above-division  units supporting the headquarters), the 1st Cavalry Division, the 3d Infantry Division,  the  4th  Infantry  Division,  and  the  3d  Armored  Cavalry Regiment.  The  equipment  of  other  units  would  be  recapitalized  as funding allowed in the ensuing fiscal years.

## Information Technology

The Army continued to make progress throughout the fiscal year in improving the software and hardware systems used to control logistical inventories  and  to  monitor  the  distribution  of  materiel.  Originally conceived as a means to correct logistical difficulties identified during Operations Desert  sHielD and Desert  storm ,  the  Total  Distribution Planning  system  supported  the  combat  support  and  combat  service support units of the Army, as well as the technological transformation of  operational  forces.  Funding  for  the  system  in  FY  2001  focused on development, fielding, implementation, and integration of communication services for logistical applications and the acquisition of  Automatic  Identification  Technology  to  enhance  the  visibility  of assets in inventories and in transit.

Automatic  Identification  Technology  included  a  suite  of  storage technologies, such as bar code readers, radio frequency identification devices, and  magnetic  storage  media,  and  was  used  to  process information  on  logistical  assets  throughout  the  distribution  system. It  also  included the hardware and software required to provide these devices  with  data,  read  the  information  on  them,  and  integrate  that information  with  information  from  other  devices  or  systems.  The Army's infrastructure for logistical information consisted of Automatic Identification Technology devices and their supporting servers, networks,  communications  links,  databases,  and  transportation  and supply nodes, through which supplies and units move along the supply and  deployment  pipeline  from  factory  to  unit,  from  home  base  to theater deployment locations.

The Automatic Identification Technology logistical devices and systems operated by the Army had remained unchanged since their initial acquisition, yet the technology outside the Army continued to evolve. In response, during FY  2001,  the Army  examined  the  use  of  readily  available,  off-the-shelf commercial devices  and  systems  to  incorporate  into  the  suite.  Examples of  current  commercially  proven  and  available  technologies  useable  for military applications included radio frequency labels for hazardous material tracking,  chemical  defense  sensors,  radio  frequency  connections  with satellite communications, and property book automation systems.

To  take  advantage  of  Internet  technologies,  the  Logistics  Integration Agency  began  to  develop  a  Distribution  Knowledge  Center  Web  site for  the  Force  Projection  and  Distribution  Directorate  of  the  Office  of the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics.  The  agency  made  progress  on the development of content and design of the Web site and served as the primary liaison between the directorate and technical subject matter experts throughout the logistics staff, as well as the Logistics Knowledge Center. When completed, the Distribution Knowledge Center would improve the management  and  oversight  of  materiel  distribution. The  Web  site  would also serve as the central comprehensive repository for distribution-related policies and provide access to current and emerging regulations and doctrine governing materiel distribution. Users of the Web site would also be able to identify and synchronize ongoing distribution-related efforts conducted by organizations external to HQDA, including the U.S. Army Combined Arms Support  Command,  Defense  Logistics  Agency,  and  U.S.  Transportation Command. The Web site would also keep track of the efforts of various civilian  contractors  working  under  these  organizations.  Finally,  the  Web site  would  provide  an  interface  for  ongoing  Department  of  Defense  and joint  transformation  initiatives  involving  logistical  processes,  such  as  the integration of logistical functions and end-to-end distribution management of materiel.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The Army restructured the acquisition program for the Crusader selfpropelled howitzer in January 2000 and began seeking weight reductions that would improve its ability to deploy by air, rather than by sealift. Despite these steps, the Army still faced considerable congressional opposition to the continued funding and development of the program. During the debates over the FY 2001 budget, the Senate Appropriations Committee cut $155 million from the program's $355 million budget, pending a review to be conducted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and suggested that the Army restructure the program to develop a next-generation self-propelled artillery system that would be compatible with Future Combat Systems. In December 2000, the Office of the Secretary of Defense' s report defended the program, and Congress restored full funding in February 2001. Work then  continued  to  complete  the  design  for  the  program' s  preliminary review, scheduled to take place in early fiscal year 2002.

The RAH-66 Comanche, the Army's next-generation armed reconnaissance helicopter, was the first helicopter designed and developed specifically for both light attack and reconnaissance missions.  When fielded, the  Comanche, equipped with modern avionics, electronic sensors, and weapons systems, will replace both the Army's AH-1 Cobra light attack and  OH-58  Kiowa Warrior  reconnaissance  helicopters. The  Comanche program passed a series of tests and entered a two-year engineering and manufacturing development stage in April 2000. Work began on producing five pre-production aircraft within two years, and eight production aircraft by 2004. The prime contractor, Boeing-Sikorsky, however, had difficulty producing an aircraft that met the  Army' s required weight and engine power requirements. To redress these and other problems with the helicopter' s design, in January 2001, the Department of Defense increased funding for the program by $504 million, including approximately $420 million for production costs. Despite the increased funding, in early September 2001, the Comanche project manager reported that the aircraft' s cost, schedule, and performance requirements could not be met. This resulted in plans for a fifth major restructuring of the Comanche program, to take place in the subsequent fiscal year.

In  1999,  the  AAI  Corporation  won  a  competition  of  prototype unmanned aerial vehicle systems. In January 2000, the Army, impressed with  the  company' s  Shadow  200  test  model,  awarded  the  company  the contract to develop the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. The ensuing development work proceeded rapidly, leading to an initial operational test and  evaluation  in  only  seventeen  months.  The  Shadow  200  underwent developmental testing at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, between December 2000 and April 2001. In May of 2001, the Shadow began the initial operational

test and evaluation process at Fort Hood, Texas. Several incidents resulted in the Army converting the evaluation to a limited user test. Between July and September 2001, AAI modified the Shadow to correct several design deficiencies identified during the evaluation process. The Army expected to complete the evaluation process in FY 2002.

## Support Services

Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

In FY 2001, the Army' s budget included a total of $48.2 million for the Army Community Service, a 7 percent increase over the amount programmed in the previous fiscal year. Before the year had ended, the Army received a total of $50.9 million for the service. A total of $2.97 million provided a broad range of employment services to more than 267,140 patrons. The Employment Readiness program made more than 45,503 job referrals and helped secure paid  employment for 7,750 family members, bringing in revenue of more than $155 million to Army households. In addition, Employment Readiness provided  career  assessment  and  employment  search  counseling  to  37,950 clients worldwide,  including  soldiers,  family  members,  Department  of Defense civilians, and retirees. A further 14,903 clients received job skills training to assist with their professional careers.

In addition to these funds, the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization Act supported several new and expanded benefits that were advanced through the  ongoing Army  Family Action  Plan  process:  military  participation  in the Federal Thrift Savings Plan; chiropractic services at selected locations; elimination of TRICARE Prime copayments and expansion of TRICARE Prime  Remote  to  active  duty  family  members;  reduction  of  catastrophic cap for retiree health care from $7,500 to $3,000; TRICARE for Life for seniors over the age of sixty-five; and retiree access to retail and national mail-order  pharmacies.  Policy  changes  that  resulted  from  Army  Family Action Plan issues included granting dependents of full-time, local-hirenonappropriated-fund  employees  equal  enrollment  priority  with  localhire-appropriated-fund employees at Department of Defense Dependents Schools; authorizing family readiness group newsletters to include unofficial information not exceeding 20 percent of the printed space; and allowing soldiers to request tour stabilization if a graduating high school senior was in their household.

## Installation Management

In FY 2001, Army installation managers faced numerous budgetary pressures that affected daily life for tenants and residents on Army posts.

The Army received $898 million for the year to construct housing, training facilities,  and  air,  sea,  road,  and  rail  mobility  facilities  on  its  active duty installations. The  National  Guard  received  $59  million  in  military construction funds for its installations, and the Army Reserve received a further $82 million. Despite these sums, the Army' s installations continued to be underfunded for base operations services, including transportation, utilities, leasing, food  service,  and  morale,  welfare,  and  recreation activities. The Army  also  received  inadequate  funds  for  real  properties maintenance accounts, which were necessary for maintenance, restoration, and modernization of facilities. As a result, quality of life and provision of services on bases suffered during the fiscal year.

## Housing and Infrastructure

Despite inadequate funding to support base maintenance, the Army made housing improvements on its installations a priority for FY 2001. The annual budget provided $92 million for new housing construction, while  total  Army  Family  Housing  funds  for  operations  and  utilities, maintenance, and leasing amounted to $1.14 billion. The Army entered the fiscal year with a goal, previously agreed to by the Army and Department of Defense, of eliminating all inadequate family housing in the continental United  States  by  2007.  The  Army  hoped  this  could  be  accomplished through  additional  military  construction  of  new  housing,  increases  in Basic  Allowance  for  Housing  funds,  and  increased  privatization.  The latter, supported by the 1996 Military Housing Privatization Initiative Act, allowed the private sector to provide housing construction, maintenance, and management services to the Army. With congressional support and aided by privatization, the Army aimed to provide adequate housing for all soldiers within seven years.

The centerpiece of the Army's attempt to reinvigorate its housing was  the  Residential  Communities  Initiative  (RCI),  in  which  the Army  entered  into  contracts  with  private  real  estate  developers  to provide  quality  modern  residential  communities  for  soldiers  and their families. In FY 2001, four RCI projects were under way at Fort Carson,  Colorado;  Fort  Hood, Texas;  Fort  Lewis,  Washington;  and Fort Meade, Maryland. Plans called for another twenty-four projects by  FY  2005  that  would  build  or  renovate  over  sixty-nine  thousand new homes, or almost 80 percent of the Army's housing inventory. The Fort Carson RCI effort, the first to begin, started in 1999. By the end of FY 2001, the initiative funded the construction of 240 new houses and the renovation of 480 preexisting houses. When the RCI project reaches its conclusion, the post will have 840 new homes and an additional 1,823 homes renovated.

As  part  of  RCI,  the  Army  announced  in  April  2001  that  it  would request  Congress  to  approve  the  largest  public-private  joint  venture  for military housing privatization at Fort Hood. Upon approval and transfer of assets and operations to the developing partner at the beginning of the next fiscal year, this effort will result in the construction of 290 new homes and revitalization of a further 5,622 homes, completely replacing or improving the post' s family housing within fifty years at a cost of $4 billion. The next month, the Army signed a contract to begin an RCI housing project at Fort Meade to build 308 new homes and renovate 2,862 others, and another to  construct  345  new  homes  and  upgrade  3,637  existing  homes  at  Fort Lewis. The implementation of RCI represented the Army's first attempt to  develop and manage soldier housing in a central and comprehensive manner, rather than at the installation level, and provided quality housing to soldiers and families more rapidly than in the past.

To coordinate the Army's housing programs and initiatives, the Army gained congressional approval for its Army Family Housing Master Plan. The plan included a long-term investment strategy based on privatization and military construction to eliminate the Army' s inadequate housing by 2010. The Army would reach this goal by adding twenty-five RCI project to the four already under way. Unfortunately, Congress found the ambitious goals of the Army Family Housing Master Plan unaffordable and did not authorize  the  additional  $186.3  million  in  federal  equity  contributions to  support  the  twenty-five  RCI  projects. To  offset  part  of  the  unfunded requirements, in August 2001 the Army eliminated five of the new RCI projects, which reduced projected costs for the remaining twenty by $130 million. At that time, the Army also revised its Defense Planning Guidance for  fiscal  years  2003-2007  and  shifted  its  goal  to  eliminate  inadequate housing by 2007, rather than 2010. To meet this accelerated goal, the Army reprogrammed $1.09 billion for housing construction between fiscal years 2005 and 2007.

As  improvements  to  installation  housing  made  measured  progress during FY 2001, the Army also secured legislative and executive approval for the expansion of the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California. The Army successfully argued that improvements to its equipment, the growing sophistication of its doctrine, and the increased number of training scenarios demanded by the changing face of warfare in the modern world justified the enlargement of the National Training Center. The expansion increased the installation by 131,000 acres.

While improving soldier housing and training, the  Army also continued to preserve the heritage of its installations. On 28 August 2001, the Army entered into contracts with two private companies to redevelop Fort Sam Houston, Texas, two-thirds of which was considered historic. Agreements called for a real estate developer and environmental engineering company

to preserve three buildings on the post, including the Brooke  Army Medical Center, and to redevelop 465,000 non-excess square feet of building space on the installation at an estimated cost of $50 million. The two companies later  subleased  the  new  properties  to  private  and  public  companies  that provided services to post tenants. By entering into this precedent-setting partnership, the Army hoped to receive almost one-quarter billion dollars over the three fifty-year leases signed with the developers while avoiding maintenance  and  preservation  costs  and  protecting  a  crucial  part  of  its history.

## Safety

The Army lost 168 soldiers to accidents in FY 2001, six more than in the previous fiscal year. The greatest killer continued to be accidents involving personally owned vehicles, which accounted for one hundred, or 59.5 percent, of the deaths. Other accidental deaths included thirteen from  fires  and  explosions,  eleven  from  aviation  operations,  ten  from Army motor vehicle accidents, two from Army combat vehicle accidents, and thirty-two from personal injury accidents such as sports, recreation, and military training. In addition to the deaths of soldiers, the Office of Workers'  Compensation,  Department  of  Labor,  recorded  nine  Army civilian  employee  fatalities  during  the  fiscal  year.  Of  these  nine  cases, seven were determined to be unrelated to official duties.

The Army's Class A-D ground safety record for FY 2001 improved since  the  previous  fiscal  year. There  were  355  privately  owned  vehicle accidents,  down  22  percent  from  FY  2000;  1,255  personnel  injury accidents, down 9 percent; 542 Army wheeled motor vehicle accidents, down 26 percent; and 38 Army combat vehicle accidents, down 33 percent. Army aviation, however, experienced a 7 percent increase in Class A-C accidents over FY 2000, primarily due to an upsurge in Class A and B accidents.

To  help  monitor  safety-related  information,  the Army  continued  to develop and improve the Risk Management Information System, a Webbased system designed to provide management information and hazard controls to commanders, leaders, and other personnel. The system utilized state-of-the-art  risk  management  tools,  including  information  systems, databases, leader training, and safety media.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  provided  support  to deployed  forces  during  FY  2001,  operating  sixteen  facilities  throughout the Balkans, in addition to temporary facilities for soldiers participating in

major exercises in the continental United States, Egypt, South Korea, Japan, Thailand,  the  Philippines,  and  Poland.  A  national  economic  downturn, coupled with customer access restrictions in the wake of the 11 September attacks,  adversely  affected  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service' s revenues  during  the  fiscal  year.  Projected  worldwide  revenues  of  $7.143 billion represented a decrease from the record high of $7.369 billion reached in  FY  2000,  but  earnings  of  over  $360  million  exceeded  the  service' s planned goal of $345 million. These earnings were higher than had been forecast and provided a dividend of $243.9 million for the morale, welfare, and recreation programs of the armed services. In support of operations in 2001, appropriated funds offset approximately 2 percent of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service' s expenses. This funding paid for worldwide transportation  of  merchandise,  overseas  utility  costs,  defense  telephone system access, external facility maintenance, and the salaries of the sixtyeight  active  duty Army  and Air  Force  members  assigned  to  the  service. Capital  expenditures  for  construction  and  renovation  in  2001  exceeded $205 million, up from the $202 million expended in the previous fiscal year. These expenditures subsidized the construction of new shopping and food service facilities at  Y ongsan Garrison, South Korea; Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi; Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico; Robins Air Force Base, Georgia; Fort Eustis,Virginia; and Fort Jackson, South Carolina.

## Special Functions

## Civil Works

The Civil Works Program, executed by the Army Corps of Engineers, provided for nationwide water resources development and management in FY 2001. The program carried out investigations and surveys, engineering and design, construction, rehabilitation, and the operation and maintenance of  flood  control,  navigation,  environmental  restoration,  and  multipurpose hydroelectric power projects having a replacement value of over $125 billion. The  program  supported  improvements  in  flood  control,  storm  damage prevention, navigation, environmental restoration, and other water resources issues. In addition to this direct federal investment program, the Civil Works Program also included an important mission to regulate the discharge of dredged and fill material in waters and wetlands of the United States.

During  FY  2001,  there  were  an  average  of  161  military  personnel assigned  to  the  Civil  Works  Program.  Civilian  employees  accumulated 24,670 work-years for this program in FY 2001. This figure represented a  decrease of 106 work-years from the previous fiscal year. There were a total of 1,481 civil works projects under construction during the fiscal year:  454  that  were  specifically  authorized  by  Congress  and  1,027  that were smaller projects.

The  annual  appropriation  for  civil  works  during  FY  2001  totaled $4.544 billion.  Presidential  budgets  of  recent  years  included  few  new construction starts and stretched out construction schedules because of funding constraints.  In  FY  2001,  Congress  responded  by  both  adding new  starts  and  increasing  financial  support  for  underfunded  projects. However, funding for construction programs in various stages of planning, design,  and  construction  or  operations  remained  inadequate,  delaying their  completion  and  resulting  in  increased  building  and  maintenance costs,  lost  benefits,  accelerated  deterioration  of  facilities,  and  reduced services.

## Environmental Protection

The Army received 107 new enforcement actions for environmental concerns in FY 2001, a 15 percent reduction from the 126 new enforcement

actions  received  in  FY  2000.  This  decrease  occurred  even  though  the number  of  inspections conducted  by  regulatory agencies remained constant.  The  enforcement  action-to-inspection  ratio  decreased  by  17 percent to 0.14 percent during the fiscal year, the lowest level since FY 1993, when the Army began keeping statistics on such actions. During the fiscal year, 57 percent of installations received no new enforcement actions. This improvement was achieved in spite of the fact that the number and stringency of laws and regulations has continued to increase significantly over  time.  Despite  the  improvement  made  during  FY  2001  in  reducing new enforcement actions,  the Army  was  still  assessed  sixteen  fines  for environmental infractions for a total of $884,000 and paid $2.3 million to settle twenty-two other cases.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU) bore the primary responsibility for the Army Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions Program, which was established by the National Defense Act of 1987. This mandate required the Army to set a goal for 5 percent of its contracts to go to small and disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority-owned institutions. The Army SADBU office focused on securing contracting  opportunities  for  historically  black  institutions  of  higher learning  and  minority-owned  institutions  in  the  areas  of  procurement, research, development, testing and evaluation, military construction and operations,  and  maintenance.  The  Army  also  participated  in  technical assistance conferences and workshops to enhance the participation of such institutions in Army-sponsored programs.

In  FY  2001,  the  Army  exceeded  the  goals  assigned  to  it  by  the Department of Defense for prime contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses and to historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. The Army awarded slightly more than $86 million, or  15  percent,  of  all  funds  allocated  to  institutions  of  higher  education to  historically  black  colleges  and  universities  and  minority  institutions. Historically black colleges and universities received contracts and grants totaling  $20.4  million;  Hispanic-serving  institutions  received  contracts and grants totaling $30.3 million; tribal colleges and universities received $3 million in contracts and grants; and other minority institutions received contracts and grants totaling $32.3 million.

Lasting  the  four  years  prior  to  FY  2001,  the  Army  experienced  a consistent increase in contract awards to women-owned firms, rising from $860 million in FY 1998 to a high of nearly $1.4 billion for FY 2001. The Army was the first and only federal agency to award more than $1 billion

to women-owned small businesses in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. While the Army did not quite meet the federally mandated goal of 5 percent, it achieved 4 percent in FY 2001, up from 3.5 percent in the previous fiscal year.

## Legal Affairs

Overall, the court-martial rate during the year was 2.35 per thousand soldiers (Table 3) .  The number of nonjudicial punishments imposed during this same time frame was 45,082, for a rate of 94.1 per thousand soldiers. There were increases in the number of soldiers accused of absence without leave and computer offenses involving pornography. A recent change in Army policy returns most soldiers who surrender or are arrested for absence without leave to their home stations. Military judges at installations with significant numbers of returnees noted a corollary increase in the number of courts-martial for both long and short-term absences.

During FY 2001,  Army attorneys defended the Department of the  Army and its officials against civil litigation in approximately 470 actions filed in federal, state, and international courts. Most of these cases were filed by former soldiers seeking collateral review of courts-martial proceedings or back-pay actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims. Other suits involved challenges  to  confinement  conditions,  to  decisions  to  deny  clemency or  parole,  to  revoke  parole,  or  to  other  administrative  actions  taken  by confinement facility officials.

One case of particular note, Hall v. Department of Defense , involved a class action suit filed in 1997 by the entire inmate population confined to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The inmates claimed they were subject to unsafe living conditions, violating the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. They  alleged  that  the  main  building  of  the  barracks  was  structurally unsound, that they were exposed to unsafe environmental conditions, and that  they  were  improperly  subjected  to  certain  administrative  practices. The district court denied the inmates' request for a preliminary injunction

ordering the Army to transfer them to other correctional institutions. In January 1999, the Army filed a motion for summary judgment, maintaining that the inmates were not exposed to unsafe living conditions and that the barrack' s administrative practices were proper and accepted correctional methods. The plaintiffs' attorney later moved to dismiss the case, claiming that because the new disciplinary barracks would be completed in 2001, the issues presented by the lawsuit would be moot. The court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice in February 2001. Several of the inmates, however, appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers moved back the completion date for the new barracks to June 2002. By the time the fiscal year ended, the Court of Appeals had remanded the case to the district court to determine what effect, if any, the new completion date would have on the inmates' health and safety.

## Reviews and Inspections

On  29  September  1999,  the  Associated  Press  published  an  article about a purported massacre of approximately 350 South Korean civilians at  the  hands  of American  airmen  and  members  of  the  7th  Cavalry,  1st Cavalry Division, in July 1950. The day after the appearance of the report, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen directed the secretary of the Army to  conduct  a  review  of  the  allegations.  On  25  October  1999,  Secretary Caldera assigned Lt. Gen. Michael W . Ackerman, the Department of the Army Inspector General, to begin a formal review. The Republic of Korea also  began  its  own  investigation  into  the  incident.  The  American  and Korean efforts operated independently but cooperated closely and shared information.

The Inspection Division of the Department of the Army Inspector General formed the No Gun Ri Review Team (also called the U.S. Review Team). To monitor and oversee the review team, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs Charles L. Cragin created a steering group, which included Patrick T. Henry, the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs, and Charles A. Blanchard, the Army general counsel. In order to increase public trust in the independence and veracity of the review, Secretary Cohen invited eight outside experts in the fields of military history, journalism, and U.S.-Korean relations to join the review team.

The  review  team  started  work  on  27  October  1999.  For  the  next fifteen months, Army investigators and researchers studied the available evidence and official records, examining over a million pages of official documents and tens of thousands of reels of Air Force reconnaissance film. They also conducted almost two hundred interviews with soldiers who served in  the  vicinity  of  No  Gun  Ri  at  the  time  of  the  incident.

On 28 December 2000, General Ackerman forwarded the final report of  the  review  team  to  the  secretary  of  the  Army.  Secretary  Caldera approved  the  findings  and  sent  them  to  the  secretary  of  defense  for further  review.  Public  release  of  the  report  came  the  next  month. The investigation concluded that the deaths of the South Koreans at No Gun Ri was a regrettable tragedy caused by the Army's lack of preparedness for major combat operations when the Korean War broke out. American troops at No Gun Ri, the report found, had deficient leadership and were inadequately trained for the kind of combat they faced. At the time of the  incident,  the  soldiers  of  the  7th  Cavalry  were  conducting  a  hasty, confused,  and  disorganized  retreat,  engaging  in  sporadic  skirmishes with  North  Korean  forces,  and  had  legitimate  concerns  about  North Korean infiltrators hiding among the masses of South Korean refugees. The report  did  not  find  evidence  of  a  concerted  or  deliberate  plan  or policy to kill South Korean civilians. It also faulted the South Korean National Police for its inability to control the overwhelming number of refugees. Finally, the report suggested that the number of victims cited in the original Associated Press story and by the official South Korean investigation was most likely inflated.

In addition to the No Gun Ri review, the Inspection Division of the Office  of  the  Inspector  General  completed  two  other  major  inspections during the fiscal year and assisted with a third. The first, requested by the secretary of the Army, concerned the resourcing, equipping, and manning of the Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) Program. The inspection  found  that  many  instructors,  some  of  whom  spent  their own money to support cadets, did not fully understand JROTC funding regulations and procedures. Further, the inspection concluded that insufficient  funding  and  a  shortage  of  qualified  instructors  discouraged cadets from participating in the program. Vice Chief of Staff General John M. Keane requested the second inspection, which regarded compliance with  environmental  regulations  at  Army  installations.  This  inspection revealed  that  the Army' s  environmental  regulations  and  responsibilities were largely misunderstood or ignored at installations and that inadequate training  and  funding  was  in  place  for  environmental  programs.  Lastly, the Inspection Division assisted in a triennial review of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service led by the Air Force Inspection Agency, which identified  several  weaknesses  to  be  corrected  in  its  customer  relations, employee development, and marketing programs.

In addition to these major inspections, the Assistance Division dealt with  2,022  Inspector  General  Action  Requests  regarding  non-senior officials or individuals, a slight increase of 6 percent from the previous fiscal year. A total of 1,369 of these were requests for assistance, and 653 were allegations, of which 476 were found to be unsubstantiated.

## Army Audit Agency

During FY 2001, the U.S. Army Audit Agency performed a triennial quality control review of the Army' s Internal Review Program going back for  a  twelve-month  period  to  31  March  2000. The  review  included  the Headquarters, Department of the Army, Management Services; the Internal Review  Directorate;  and  twenty-eight  other  internal  review  activities, including those of five Army major commands and two HQDA internal review offices. The review found that four of the five major commands and both HQDA internal review activities had adequate quality control programs in place or had programs needing only minor improvements. One major command needed to implement a quality control review program for its subordinate internal review offices. In addition, some major command field offices needed to improve aspects of their quality control systems in order to provide reasonable assurance that the auditors followed established policies, procedures, and applicable auditing standards.

In addition to the triennial review, the audits performed by the Army Audit Agency during the fiscal year included reviews of the U.S. Army Corps  of  Engineers'  financial  statements  for  its  civil  works  programs, modernization training, distance learning programs, railway usage, financial management of the Army General Fund, and contracting services on Army installations. Alongside its auditing responsibilities, the Army Audit Agency also provided consulting services to the Army' s leadership. During  FY  2001,  consulting  took  up  approximately  15  percent  of  the agency's time and personnel resources.

## Attack on the Pentagon

On  the  morning  of  11  September  2001,  al-Qaeda  terrorists hijacked four airliners in mid-flight over the eastern United States. At 8:46 a.m., the first airplane crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, New York. At the time, General Shinseki was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, attending a conference of the chiefs of staff of Pacific nation armies. He telephoned Assistant Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations  and  Plans  Maj.  Gen.  Phillip R.  Kensinger,  and  Brig.  Gen.  Peter  W.  Chiarelli,  the  director  of operations,  mobilization  and  readiness  in  the  Office  of  the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. As General Shinseki was on the telephone, a second hijacked aircraft struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center.  Following  General  Shinseki's  instructions, Generals  Kensinger  and  Chiarelli  activated  the  Army  Operations Center's  Crisis  Action  Team  to  monitor  the  situation  and  began developing plans to respond to the disaster.

Approximately  thirty  minutes  later,  American  Airlines  Flight  77, hijacked by five terrorists as it left Dulles International Airport, crashed into the western side of the Pentagon. All onboard the aircraft, including the  terrorists,  fifty-eight  passengers,  and  the  flight' s  six  crewmembers, perished  in  the  crash.  The  plane  smashed  through  the  first  three  rings of  the  Pentagon,  spreading  fire  and  smoke  throughout  the  building  and damaging the remaining two rings. A total of 125 Department of Defense personnel  lost  their  lives  in  the  attack. A  further  106  received  injuries that required hospitalization. The Department of the Army, with seventyfive dead, including twenty-two soldiers, forty-seven civilian employees, and six contractors, suffered more casualties than any other Department of Defense organization. ( See Table 4 .)  Most of the Army' s losses were soldiers and civilians located in offices on the first and second floors of the Pentagon, between the fourth and sixth corridors. Two Department of the Army offices were particularly hard hit by the attack. Thirty-two civilians working for the Resource Management Directorate of the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army were killed. Twentysix personnel in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel lost their lives, including the deputy chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude. He was the highest-ranking soldier to die in the attack.

After  the  initial shock  of  the attack wore  off, personnel began to exit the  stricken  building,  and military  and  civilians  alike  assisted in  rescuing  trapped  coworkers  and administering  first  aid.  Responders from  local  city,  county,  state,  and federal agencies swiftly and capably conducted  most  of  the  firefighting, medical  care,  and  other  emergency response  tasks.  A  total  of  seventyseven HQDA personnel later received decorations for their actions or injuries sustained on the morning of 11 September.

General Maude

Following the plane's crash, almost all Department of the Army personnel  evacuated  the  building, most heading for the parking lots or the courtyard in the center of the Pentagon. The Army Operations Center remained manned throughout the attack and its aftermath, and Secretary White and General Keane made their  ways  there  to  provide  leadership  and  guidance. The  vice

General Keane, left , and Secretary White, 13 September 2001

chief of staff sent messages throughout the Army to inform subordinate commands that HQDA was still directing operations. Amid the hectic activity  and  confusion,  the  Army  Operations  Center  staff  removed Secretary White, despite his objection, to a remote location. Later, the staff realized that his relocation had not been required by the situation in  accordance  with  contingency  plans.  The  evacuation  of  Secretary White left General Keane in charge at the Pentagon for the remainder of the day.

Despite  the  destruction  caused  by  the  impact  of  the  airliner,  the Pentagon still stood. The damage to the building would have been greater had the plane not struck an area recently improved and reinforced during an extensive, years-long renovation project. Although parts of the Pentagon remained filled with flame and smoke, the grim work of recovering the dead began the next morning. Soldiers of the 3d Infantry (The Old Guard) received  the  task  of  collecting  remains,  which  they  turned  over  to  the Federal Bureau of Investigation after proper military honors and respects were rendered.

As recovery efforts continued, the Department of Defense established a family assistance center based at the Sheraton Hotel in nearby Crystal City,  Virginia.  There,  the  families  of  victims  received  counseling  and medical  and  legal  advice.  The  center  ultimately  came  under  control of  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy Lt. Gen. John A. Van Alstyne

provided  the  leadership  and  day-today  supervision  necessary  for  the center  to  perform  its  sensitive  and important duties.

Operation noble eagle , the domestic response to the attacks on New  York  City  and  the  Pentagon, began on 15 September 2001. President Bush authorized the mobilization  of  ten  thousand  Army reservists and guardsmen, along with thousands of reservists from the other armed services. The mobilized soldiers performed homeland defense  missions,  such  as  guarding the attack sites and airports, as well as civil support missions. Operation noble eagle continued  on  into  the next fiscal year as planning began for

Operation enDuring FreeDom , the retaliatory strike against al-Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan.

## 10 Conclusion

The Army  entered  FY  2001  with  great  optimism. The  service  had begun to shake itself out of the doldrums of the post-Cold War drawdown and  budget  reductions.  It  had  a  compelling,  albeit  fiscally  expensive and  technologically  audacious,  vision  of  its  future.  While  focused  on the developments of the next twenty to thirty years, the Army' s leaders were also keenly aware of the need to improve its current inventory of equipment, materiel, and installations, as well as the quality of leadership and the quality of life it offered to its soldiers and their families.

On  the  eve  of  11  September  2001,  the Army  appeared  to  be  on  a stable and secure institutional footing. No major foreign power capable of  threatening  U.S.  security  and  interests  existed,  and  although  the peacekeeping mission in the Balkans continued, Department of Defense officials expected that no major conflicts would arise in the near future. The leaders of Headquarters, Department of the Army, therefore concentrated their  efforts  during  FY  2001  on  internal  reorganizations,  making  what improvements  they  could  under  budgetary  constraints  and  maintaining current  readiness  levels.  Despite  its  peacetime  priorities  and  activities during the previous eleven months, the Army would still prove itself ready and capable of toppling the Taliban regime and disrupting the al-Qaeda terrorist network in Afghanistan during the next fiscal year. The events of 11 September, however, were only the beginning of what would become an era of protracted conflict and uncertainty for the Army.
