## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1994

## Introduction

## Highlights of the Army's Activities

In fiscal  year  (FY)  1994,  the  Army  faced  exacting  challenges  and wide-scale transition. As the service continued post- Cold War downsizing and force  reductions,  it  encountered increasingly varied  obligations  and missions. Secretary of the Army Togo D. West, Jr., registered grave con› cern that "as the Cold War has ended, the world has become a more com› plex and dangerous place. Our daily commitments now encompass disas› ter relief  along the banks of  the Mississippi and in Georgia, peacekeeping operations in Somalia, humanitarian assistance in Rwanda and Zaire, and a deterrent presence on the Korean peninsula." The Army witnessed a 300 percent increase in operational deployments after the end of  the Cold War, with soldiers and civilians  deploying  to  more than seventy countries  in 1994. While the Army continued downsizing, soldiers, civilians, and units faced  the  prospect of being  sent on repeated deployments  to  carry  out combat operations and operations other than war.

A steep decline in resources threatened to aggravate the difficulties of responding to a variety of  complex and dangerous challenges. Financially, the Army's  Total Obligation Authority (TOA) dropped 36 percent between FY 1989 and FY 1994. The service's share ofthe Department of Defense (DOD) budget also decreased over the same period. With shrinking bud› gets  and  fewer  resources, Army leaders faced  difficult choices between supporting operational readiness programs and making needed investment in modernization programs in order to sustain a high-quality force.

Army leaders  chose to advance planned personnel cuts to preserve some crucial modernization programs,  such as  the RAH- 66  Comanche armed  reconnaissance  helicopter  and  the  self-propelled 155-mm. Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS). The Army's rationale for pur› suing  this course  was  explained  by  the Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS). He stated that "we have learned the cost of letting  the Army's modernization programs  stagnate between wars  in the past. We have also  learned that the cost, in terms of  soldiers'  lives, is

too high to do so again." Meanwhile, the budget submission for personnel provided for a reduced active component strength of  540,000 soldiers and 341,177 civilians by the end ofFY 1994. This figure represented an addi› tional reduction of 35,000 soldiers from the revised FY 1993 active duty end strength and 15,800 civilians from the 1993 strength.

Army leaders faced a major problem in keeping readiness programs adequately funded throughout the year. Contingency operations in partie  .. ular presented special resource challenges because they were funded from operating accounts. Unanticipated resource challenges led to a pejorative ripple effect throughout the Army. The Army canceled  training, reduced vehicle and equipment maintenance, restricted spare parts purchases, and deferred  real  property  maintenance.  These  actions  adversely  affected readiness, modernization, and quality-of-life programs.

Recognizing  that  eradicating  unnecessary  obstacles  to  service increases readiness, the Army undertook significant measures in FY 1994 to expand opportunities for women. The role of  women enlarged due to a change  in  DOD policy.  In  response  to  guidance from  the  Secretary  of Defense to the services to open more specialties and assignment opportu› nities to women, active Army representation of  women grew to 13 percent by the end of  the fiscal  year, up 0.5  percent from the start of  the year.

Another way of  boosting readiness was to make progress in prevent› ing and  eradicating sexual harassment and racial and  ethnic discrimina› tion. The service continued to examine ways to reduce sexual harassment and complaints of  racial and ethnic discrimination. The Army also sought to address better the issue of homosexuals in  the Army  by implementing new homosexual conduct policy. Under the new policy, sexual orientation will  not  be  a  bar  to  service  unless  manifested  by  homosexual  conduct. Although homosexual conduct may be a basis for rejection for enlistment, appointment, or induction, the Army will not ask or require its applicants to reveal their sexual preference.

During the fiscal year the Army recognized the need to take signifi› cant steps in its transformation from a forward-positioned Cold War army of eighteen active  divisions  to  a  power-projection force  of twelve  active divisions  based largely  in the  United States.  In breaking away  from  the Cold War mold, the Army faced the imposing task of  reducing itself in size and placing more responsibility for support on the reserve components. The Army  worked  to  forge  a  new  partnership  with the  reserve compo› nents, one that better leverages the strengths of  the Army National Guard (ARNG)  and  the  United  States Army  Reserve  (USAR). The  DCSOPS underscored the importance of  this new partnership in noting that "central to  the Army's ability to execute future missions  is  improved access to the reserve components." Under terms of  a major restructuring agreement, the Guard  would  continue  to  provide  the  U.S. Army's  principal  combat

reserve  forces,  with  combat  service  and  combat  service  support  units divided between the Guard and the Army Reserve. To improve the Guard's ground combat capability, the Army plans to associate fifteen enhanced brigades from the ARNG with active units for training. ("Enhanced" units are those that will receive sufficient resources and training to enable them to begin deploying to a crisis within ninety days of  mobilization.)

Perhaps more important than redefining the relationship between the active  and  reserve  components,  the Army  moved  from  being  a  threat› based force to a capabilities-based force; and from an army with roots in the industrial age to an army actively exploring the promise of  the infor› mation age. As the Chief of Staff, Army (CSA), looked to the future, he held the conviction that information-age technology would revolutionize the way the Army conducts military operations. In line with this reason› ing,  the Army began establishing the conceptual foundations for a future information-age force called Force XXI. At the heart of  the Army's  vision for Force XXI was the belief that in the future information will be almost as important as ammunition. In its desire to produce a future force that can achieve decisive victory,  the Army began developing plans to  overmatch its adversaries by integrating state of  the art information technologies with its weapon systems. This integration is called digitization. The mission of overseeing and coordinating the integration of  Army battlefield digitiza› tion activities went to the newly created Army Digitization Office (ADO). Efforts to develop Force XXI represented the first step in a dramatic move toward reconceptualizing and redesigning the Army at all echelons.

Along with efforts to adopt  postindustrial technology, the Army revised its modernization concepts. Army modernization was no longer about sys› tems  but about capabilities. The Army made the initial steps to bring the power of the information age to  logistics and sustainment. Working with the Air Force and the Navy, the Army initiated strategic mobility programs vital  to  the nation.  Operational planning concepts  based on force genera› tion,  adaptive  planning,  and  innovative  force  packaging  from  readiness pools became hallmarks of  the post- Cold War transformation.

Fielding  new  and  improved  management  and  information  systems also played a pivotal role  in  facilitating  the Army's transition to  a  more efficient  post-Cold  War  power-projection  force.  The  fielding  of the Replacement  Operations  Automation  Management  System  (ROAMS), which better manages personnel flow in military operations and emergen› cies, and the improved Mobilization Manpower Planning System (MOB› MAN),  which  better  supports  mobilizations  and planning  in  personnel management, highlighted the trend in major management and information initiatives during the year.

As the Army changed, the role of  Army installations also changed. Recognizing the long-standing need to improve the efficiency of  installation management, the Army created the Office of the Assistant Chief of  Staff  for Installation Management (OACSIM) in FY 1994. More than ever, installation readiness had an  important impact on Army readiness. Army  installations  became  power-projection  platforms from which forces are launched and supported in the field. Installations directly sup› ported the Army's ability to recruit and  retain high-quality soldiers and civilians, to train  and maintain the  force, and  to project and sustain the force.  Recruitment and  retention of high-quality soldiers  and  civilians are  directly  related  to  high-quality  housing;  medical  support;  morale, welfare,  and  recreation  facilities  and  activities;  post exchanges;  com› missaries;  and  family  programs. The  training  and  maintenance  of the Total Force are tied to the ability of  Army installations to provide ranges, training  facilities, simulators  and  training devices,  general  support maintenance,  and depot maintenance and repair,  as  well  as  other vital logistical support.

To  augment  installations  as  power-projection  platforms,  the  Army invested in rail and airfield upgrades, improved warehousing capabilities, and  upgrades to  other deployment facilities.  Despite  these  investments, repeated  underfunding in  base operations adversely affected Army instal› lations during the fiscal year. Installation commanders continued the prac› tice of diverting funds from  operational tempo (OPTEMPO) accounts to pay for essential services.

Environmental stewardship remained a high priority for the Army in FY 1994. The service spent $1.7 billion in this important area, a sum equal to  53  percent of  the amount the Army spent on OPTEMPO. Guided by an environmental strategy emphasizing compliance, restoration,  prevention, and conservation, the Army continued to make progress in the protection and preservation of  natural and cultural resources.

During the fiscal year the Army continued to transform  its  financial management practices to conform to the Chief Financial  Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. As the first pilot project participant in  the DOD, the Army broke new ground with initiatives that revised physical inventory policy, valuation of  assets, identif ication  of  outcome-oriented performance mea› sures, and management control. Readiness underscored the Army's focus throughout this process.

The Army  also made significant advances  in  changing  its  business practices. In implementing initiatives of  the National Performance Review (NPR),  the  Army  made  a  concerted  effort to  cut  red  tape  by  waiving restrictive  regulations  that  impeded  good  business  practices. The Army moved ahead in eliminating nonproductive costs and improving the devel› opment,  testing,  acquisition,  and  fielding  of new  systems.  During  FY 1994, off-the-shelf, nondcvelopmental items were being purchased at sig› nificant savings over the old, red-tape-encumbered system.

## National Military Strategy

In  July 1994  the  Clinton  administration  issued  the  new National Security Strategy ofEngagement and Enlargement. This document recog› nized that the end of  the Cold War fundamentally changed America's  secu› rity  imperatives,  bringing more diverse dangers in the  world than in the past while providing unparalleled opportunities to make the United States safer and more prosperous. Focusing on these threats and opportunities, the new strategy's goals concentrated on sustaining national security with military forces that are ready to fight, to bolster America's  economic revi› talization, and  to  promote democracy abroad. The document envisioned making a difference in the world tlu· ough engagement, carefully tailored to serve U.S. interests and priorities, and enlargement, fostering the com› munity of market democracies while deterring and containing a range of threats  to  the United States,  its allies,  and American interests. There are three  central  components  of the  strategy:  to  enhance  U.S.  security  by maintaining a strong defense capability and promoting cooperative secu› rity  measures, to work to open foreign markets and spur global economic growth, and to promote democracy abroad. U.S. military capabilities are critical to  the success of  this strategy, which envisions robust and flexible military forces that can deal with major regional contingencies, provide a credible  overseas  presence,  counter weapons  of mass  destruction,  con› tribute to multilateral peace operations, and support counterterrorism and other  national  security  objectives.  A  trained  and  ready,  highly  versatile Army is key to  achieving these national goals.

As the United States moved from a Cold War strategy of containment to  a post- Cold War strategy  of engagement and enlargement, the Army remained focused  on maintaining  a  well-armed, well-trained,  and ready strategic force, serving the nation at home and abroad, capable of  decisive victory. That vision guided the Army in  its efforts to  surmount the many challenges that lay ahead.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

Two  new major organizations  were  added to the Army  Staff in FY 1994. Both represented significant milestones in the Army's moderniza› tion efforts. General Order No. 8 formally  established the Office of the Assistant Chief  of  Staff  for Installation Management (OACSIM) as a staff agency within the Headquarters, Department of  the Army (HQDA), on 1 October 1993. The OACSIM's responsibilities included the promulgation of  policy and integration of doctrine pertaining to the planning, program› ming, and operation of  Army installations.

Beginning  in  the  1970s,  significant  political,  economic,  and  social changes complicated management of  installations and magnified the need for central focus and direction. Installation and garrison commanders were ill equipped  to  deal  with  the  flood  of environmental  legislation,  social issues such as child care and spousal abuse, and dramatic resource reduc› tions and base closures while trying to build a force based in the continen› tal United States (CONUS). Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s anum› ber of  studies cited serious problems and inefficiencies in installation man› agement and a lack of  emphasis by HQDA. A common finding in all these studies  was  the  absence  of a  proponent at the  Department of the Army (DA) level with knowledge of  functional policies and requirements and the authority to coordinate and integrate the two. Recommendations to correct systemic  deficiencies  varied  from  establishing  a  Base  Operations Command to creating a single organization on the Army Staff. The Army's senior leadership established the OACSIM as aDA-level proponent to cor› rect these deficiencies. Withdrawn from specified organizations and reas› signed to  the OACSIM were selected functions and resources:  installation and environmental policy from the  Chief of  Engineers;  installation man› agement functions from  the Management Directorate, Office of the Chief of  Staff, Army (OCSA); the mission of  the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Office from the OCSA; the mission ofthe U.S. Army Commercial Activities  Management  Agency  from  the  OCSA;  Installation  Support

Modules  (ISM)  and  the  major  command  (MACOM)  Internal  Support Modules  Program  from  the  U.S.  Army  Decision  Systems  Management Agency;  the mission of the  U.S.  Army  Community  and  Family  Support Center (CFSC) and the Army Family Liaison Office from the Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (ODCSPER); the mission of  the U.S. Army Toxic and  Hazardous  Materials Agency  (redesignated as the U.S. Army Environmental Center under the OACSIM) from the Army Corps of Engineers; the mission of the U.S. Army Environmental Office (redesig› nated as  the  Office  of the  Director,  Environmental  Programs,  under  the OACSIM) from the Chief  of  Engineers; housing and facilities policy func› tions  and  natural  and  cultural  resource  functions  from  the  U.S.  Army Engineering and Housing Support Center; intraservice, interservice, inter› departmental,  and interagency  support  functions  and the Base-level Commercial Equipment Program from the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff  for Logistics (ODCSLOG).

The establishment of a second new organization on the Army Staff, the Army Digitization Office (ADO), was another significant modern› ization reform. The trend leading to the establishment of  the office began in the early 1990s, as Army modernization faced an uncertain future. The end of  the Cold War presented the Army with challenges of  modernizing in  an  austere  fiscal  environment defined  by  force  structure reductions and dramatic shifts in strategic mission  and worldwide deployment.  In addition, the Persian GulfWar revealed the need for greater synchroniza› tion of military forces.  Rapid advances in technology offered the Army an opportunity  to  meet  these  challenges  better.  Several  Army  weapon systems were upgraded to use the capabilities of emerging digital infor› mation technologies, and initial results from testing these digital capabil› ities were very encouraging.

Following the Persian GulfWar, the CSA identified the need to digitize the  battlefield,  a  primary  underpinning  of  Army  modernization  require› ments, by the turn of the century. In the spring of 1993, the Vice Chief of Staff, Army (VCSA), directed that the concept of Horizontal Technology Integration  (HTI),  integrating  high-payoff technologies throughout  the entire force, be institutionalized to increase force effectiveness.

Traditionally,  the Army's main  effort for  developing  command  and control (C2) systems employed a top-down approach. Various Battlefield Functional Area proponents developed individual automated C2 systems for corps-level operations down to the brigade. These systems were based on principles of  vertical integration. This approach restricted the capabil› ity of gathering tactical information and created an unfilled requirement at lower echelons to  integrate and share critical  information within  and throughout Battlefield Operating Systems. With the proliferation of bat› tlefield  automation,  coupled  with  the  speed  at which  tactical  missions

need to be accomplished, the  decision to  digitize the  battlefield through HTI would enable the  Army  to  increase the breadth and depth of com› mand and control through near real-time situational awareness as well as reduce the risks of  fratricide.

In the summer  of  1993 the  Ad  Hoc  Working  Group  for  the Digitization of the Battlefield investigated various strategies  to  digitize the Army.  Among  the  objectives  it  identified  was  the  digitization  of a brigade by  1996 and of  a division by 1998. In the fall of 1993 the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS) directed that an effort be  undertaken  to  study  the  requirements,  cost,  and  test  and  evaluation needs and to propose a management plan for digitizing the battlefield. On 22 December 1993, a special task force reported its results to  the CSA. Following this report, the CSA commissioned a second special task force in January  1994 to  refine the reconm1endations and establish the organi› zation  and  charter  of an ADO.  The VCSA  and  the  Army Acquisition Executive  approved  the ADO charter on  9 June  1994.  It prescribed the ADO mission to oversee and coordinate the integration of all Army bat› tlefield  digitization  activities. The ADO  became the VCSA's instrument for digitization activities throughout MACOMs and the Army Acquisition Executive' s instrument for providing guidance, assistance, and direction in acquisition matters related to digitization.

Dw·ing FY 1994 the  Army  also  continued  to  execute  the decisions reached in the BRAC process. By the end ofthe fiscal year, the Army had closed  seventy-four of seventy-seven  installations scheduled for closure by  the 1989  BRAC  Commission.  One  of these,  the  Presidio  of San Francisco,  was  transferred to  the  Department of the  Interior in  October 1994, with Sixth U.S. Army continuing to occupy facilities on the Presidio under  a  special  permit.  Of 656  overseas  closures  announced  through October  1994,  the  Army  executed  493  full  and  37  partial  closures  in Europe; 17 fuH and 7 partial closures in Korea; and 1 closure in Panama. Under  the 1991 BRAC  recommendations,  the  Army  closed  the Woodbridge  Research  Facility  of  the  Harry  Diamond  Laboratory  in Virginia;  closed Fort Ord, California, and transferred two land parcels to the University of California; closed Sacramento Army Depot, California; completed  the  move  of  the 5th InfantTy Division  from  Fort  Polk, Louisiana, to Fort Hood, Texas; and initiated the move of  the 1Oth Special Forces Group fTom Fort Devens, Massachusetts, to Fort Carson, Colorado.

Army  civilian  personnel services underwent a major reorganization during the fiscal year.  In accordance with DOD plans to consolidate and streamline civilian personnel services throughout, the Army began estab› lishing  regional  Civilian  Personnel  Operations  Centers  (CPOCs).  The Army  planned  to  establish ten  regional  CPOCs,  seven  in  CONUS  and three  overseas.  As  CPOCs  are  established,  Army  installation  Civilian

Personnel Offices are to be reduced and reorganized to provide assistance as individual advisory centers.

Two  regional  CPOCs  began  operations  in  FY  1994:  the  National Capital Region, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and the U.S. Army Europe Region, Seckenheim,  Germany. The Army  identified the remaining eight CPOC regions as the Southeast Region, the Northeast Region, the South Central Region, the Southwest Region, the West Region, the Korea Region, and the Pacific Region. The locations of  CPOCs in the remaining eight regions are to be determined.

## Management and Information Systems

In June  1992  the  Joint Staff published C4! for  the  Warrior, which addressed  joint  force  operational/interoperability  issues.  This  initiative was  the  centerpiece  of the  effort  to  achieve  a  unified  and  global  C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) sys› tem to  support the  requirements of the joint warfighter, consistent with national security plans and DOD policy. The Army responded to this ini› tiative with the publication of The Army Entetprise Strategy. The strategy provided the  single,  unified  vision for the Army C4J  community in  two documents: The  Vision, published  in  July  1993,  explained  the  Army Enterprise  Principles;  and The  Army  Enterprise  Implementation  Plan, published in August 1994, identified the tasks to be accomplished in order to  achieve the goals of The Vision.

Among these tasks was the development of a technical architecture. To  facilitate  this  development,  the  Army  Science  Board  conducted  an eight-month study, beginning in January  1994, that examined the Army's vision  of the  future,  including  combat doctrine,  organization,  materiel, and the growing need for information management to support the Army in the twenty-first century. The study recommended developing a technical architecture that identified a common set of  standards to guide the defin› ition,  design, and development of the Army's Battle Command systems. The  Army  then  organized  the  Technical  Architecture  Task  Force  in September  1994  with  the  mission  of providing  the  first  version  of the technical architecture by December of that year.

Army personnel management benefited from two notable automation improvements  during  FY 1994.  The  Army made  the  Mobilization Manpower  Planning  System  (MOBMAN)  more  flexible  in  supporting mobilizations  and  planning  analyses.  The  Army  also  fielded the Replacement Operations Automation Management System (ROAMS) to manage personnel flow  better in military operations and emergencies.

The MOBMAN is the Army's sole system for compiling all the infor› mation needed to support HQDA military manpower analyses that identi-

fy  expected  personnel  surpluses  and  shortfalls  for  specific  scenarios, operation  plans,  and  contingencies. It compares  the  total  requirements (force structure and net casualty replacement needs)  with the anticipated total supply of trained manpower available,  including reserve component personnel. Because it was  originally designed to support only full  mobi› lization  planning analyses,  MOBMAN  lacked the  flexibility  of meeting the Army's post  Cold War needs.

The Army enhanced MOBMAN in FY 1994 to increase its flexibility in supporting partial mobilization planning analyses. The enhanced MOB› MAN  can  provide  quick-response  (24-72  hours)  operational  support analyses that focus on  deploying forces on Time-Phased  Force Deployment  Data.  This  capability  supports  the  HQDA  ODCSPER Manning Analysis of  Readiness and Supportability process that allows the ODCSPER to participate in formulating ODCSOPS decisions for the sup› portability  of contingency  and  operational  plans.  For  planning,  MOB› MAN also gained  the  capability of supporting analyses  for all levels  of mobilization.  These  analyses  are  part  of the  ODCSPER  Mobilization Manning Plan process  that  identifies  likely  sources  of individual  man› power to fill Army personnel shortfalls.

ROAMS, the Army's other personnel automation  initiative, also pro› vided greater flexibility in support of contingency and operational plans. One of the U.S.  Total  Army Personnel  Command' s  (PERSCOM)  major missions upon execution of  an Operation Plan (OPLAN) approved by the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  or of  military operations in support of  an emergency is  to manage individual non- unit-related personnel flow to the theater and ensure  that  supported  units  are  maintained  at  an  acceptable  personnel strength level. To  meet these challenges, PERSCOM developed ROAMS to  assist the supporting Army Component Commander (ACC) in project› ing  individual  manpower needs for specified periods and to  track man› power movement to  the  theater of operations during OPLAN execution. ROAMS interfaces with the Total Army Personnel Database (TAPDB) to obtain personnel  data  related  to  assigned  replacements.  Three program modules in ROAMS support this mission:  (1) Automation of  the Theater Shelf  Requisitioning  Process (AUTOREP);  (2)  Non- Unit-Related Personnel  Flow  Computer  Assisted  Program  (FLOWCAP);  and  (3) Automation of  the Casualty Analysis Process (AUTOCAP).

AUTOREP  sorts  casualty  replacement  data  and  generates  data  on replacements and filler personnel. AUTO  REP generates data on personnel by comparing  the  theater's  wartime  personnel  requirements  with  the peacetime authorizations. It displays the filler data in the area of  concen› tration (AOC) and the military occupational specialty (MOS) and by rank. The program sorts projected aggregate casualty information by personnel category, AOC and MOS, and grade and rank for a  specified theater of

operations to predict the number of  replacements required over time. The ACC is tasked to pre-position a theater replacement list at PERSCOM as part of the planning process.

FLOW  CAP supports the PERSCOM mission by managing the Dow of individual filler and casualty replacement personnel to the theater of  oper› ations. It provides the CONUS Replacement Centers (CRCs) the capabil› ity  to  manage, schedule,  control, and  track  the  flow  of replacement per› sonnel from  the CRC through the aerial port of  embarkation. It provides manifest data for  the Air Mobility Command and advance arrival infor› mation  for  the  ACC.  It  also  generates  internal  reports  for  the CRCs to manage and process replacements at the CRC.

AUTOCAP provides the capability to adjust the  difference  between projected  and  actual  requirements.  This  difference  is  based  on  the  pro› jected casualty estimate of  non- unit-related personnel flow  to  the theater of  operations as captured in  FLOW  CAP.  It is also based on actual casual› ty data supplied from the Army Casualty Information Processing System. AUTOCAP allows the ACC or PERSCOM the ability to adjust future pro› jected casualty requirements  based on OPTEMPO, OPLAN changes and updates, and changes in structure or policy.

In  FY 1994 the Army began developing automated system  improve› ments to streamline civilian personnel processes in accordance with DOD regionalization  plans.  Army  systems  under  development  included  the Personnel Action system to process and track personnel actions; the Core Document system to classifY civilian positions; the Automated Reduction› in-Force system to process reduction-in-force actions; the Retirement sys› tem to process retirement actions; the  Training system to process and track employee training; the Standard Automated Inventory and Referral system to track  job  vacancies  and  employee  referrals; and the  Injury  and Unemployment  Compensation  system  to  track  and  process  injury  and unemployment compensation actions. The Army also continued refining the Army Civilian Personnel System (ACPERS) database of civilian per› sonnel  positions  and  employees.  The  Army  is  working  on evolving ACPERS into the Defense Civilian Pers01mel Data System, which even› tually will  link into the Defense Civilian  Payroll System.

During the fiscal year the Army completed fielding of  the Army Food Management  Information  System  (AFMIS).  The  AFMIS  automates installation food  service  and troop subsistence  activity  processes. Automating these processes meets a congressional mandate that the Army and  the  other services automate  their  worldwide food  service  programs because  of subsistence  fraud, waste,  and  abuse  identified  in  a 1981 Defense Audit Service audit.  Software  development began in  1981  but, due to three processing concept changes, system deployment did not begin untill990.

The  Army completed fielding approximately one-third of  its total fifty› seven AFMIS sites  in 1994. AFMIS  consists of four modules:  (1) Troop Issue  Subsistence;  (2) Troop  Issue  Subsistence Activity-Warehouse;  (3) Installation Food Advisor; and (  4) Dining Facility Operations. In addition, AFMIS is mandated to automate dining facility head counts. But, because there  is  no  standard  DOD  identification  card,  the  Army  did  not begin developing this module during the fiscal year. .

The Army  Information  Systems  Selection  and  Acquisition Agency (ISSAA) awarded four major contracts in FY 1994.  One contract award, potentially  worth  $15.4  million,  went to  provide  nonpersonal  technical services  to  support  Keystone,  an  automated  personnel  system  aiding 3,000  Army  users  in  enlistments,  reenlistments,  and  assignments.  One contract, potentially worth $249.4 million, went to provide the next gen› eration of bar code equipment and services, as well  as related technolo› gies, to the DOD and the Coast Guard. Another contract, potentially worth $98.8 million, went to provide the Program Executive Officer for Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) with commercial off› the-shelf computer equipment and  support  services  to  meet worldwide tactical  requirements.  ISSAA also  awarded a contract, potentially worth $135 million, to provide the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) at  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas, with automation equipment to support more than forty computer-based simulations annually.

Army automated intelligence capabilities also continued to evolve in FY  1994. On 29  October 1993, the Defense Acquisition Science Board awarded a contract for an upgraded Block II All Source Analysis System (ASAS). The ASAS is a modular, tactically deployable, computer-assisted Intelligence and ElectTonic Warfare (IEW) processing, analysis, reporting, and  teclmical control system consisting of evolutionary sets of hardware and  software modules that perform system operations management and security,  communications  processing  and  interface,  input message  pro› cessing,  intelligence  processing  and  reporting,  target  identification  and nomination,  and  intelligence collection management. The Army  System Acquisition Review Council approved the fielding of  twelve Block I sys› tems on 29 July  1993. An ASAS variant, the ASAS-Extended (ASAS-E), provides  ASAS  capability  to  additional  units  not  scheduled  to  receive Block I ASAS. ASAS-E uses the Army Tactical Command and Control System  Common  Hardware/Common  Software  Support  and  provides open architecture, assured interoperability, and growth capability. Block I and ASAS-E systems will be upgraded with Block II enhancements begin› ning the second quarter ofFY 1995.

Another intelligence initiative, the Force Integration Master Planner (FIM), is an automated decision support system and force analysis model. It  provides  Plans,  Programs,  and  Budgeting  System  (PPBS)  analytical

support for current and future lEW systems and force structure through› out intelligence functional areas. These areas include collection, process› ing, and  dissemination. The purpose of the FIM is to  validate the objec› tive architecture in the Army Intelligence Master Plan by providing empir› ical data to support resource decisions in the lEW mission area.

In FY 1994 the FIM consolidated approximately fifty databases. This consolidation  of  databases is the  basis for the  power  of  the  FIM. Previously, not all these databases were available in one place. Their seam› less  integration provides for improved lEW resource planning. The data› base  information  is  used  by  force  integration  planners and  combat and materiel  development officers to plan and program the lEW force struc› ture. It enables retrieval and assessment of  all available pertinent informa› tion for a particular analysis. The FIM provides the user with the ability to assess many options rapidly.

With the continuing evolution of  the capabilities of  the Organizations and Cost Analysis component of the FIM in FY  1994, considerable time and  effort  were  devoted  to developing the Operational  Capabilities Analysis (OPCA) component during the fiscal year. Effective  1 October 1993, the FIM OPCA component began to measure the operational added value of  tactical U.S. Army signal intelligence and electronic warfare sys› tems. A similar function for U.S. imagery systems and supporting proces› sors, such  as  the  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)  and  the  Joint Surveillance and Targetry Attack Radar System (JSTARS), will  become available later during FY 1994. Ultimately, FIM will provide a total sys› tem-of-systems  function  for  collecting,  processing,  and  disseminating within the lEW mission area at tactical, operational, and strategic levels.

During FY 1994 the Army Safety Center developed the Army Safety Information Services and Technology (ASIST) system to correct identi› fied  deficiencies  at  HQDA  and  better support commanders' risk  man› agement requirements.  ASIST  is  the  information  management compo› nent of the Army's safety  strategy  (Safe  Force  XXI). It is  intended  to expand  and  transform  the  Army's database,  which  is  oriented  toward safety practitioners,  into a  risk management information system,  easily accessible from existing and emerging unit and installation information support systems.

The  Safety  Center  also  developed  the  Safety  Installation  Support Module (ISM),  one of six ISMs intended for use in  development of the Safety Center's  Sustaining Base Information Service (SBIS). The SBIS is intended to  provide  major improvements in quality,  standardization, and efficiency  in  the  execution  of installation  safety  programs.  The Safety ISM will provide automated processes for inspections, hazard abatement, risk  management,  and  accident  reporting  and  will  interface  with  other automated systems at Army installations and HQDA.

Finally, the  Safety Center established an electronic capability to  pro› vide to Army installation commanders tbe inspection findings and analy› ses of  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA), Department of  Labor. The Army uses the OSHA Inspection and Violation System database, available on line for use  by  the  field,  to  extract infor› mation on citations for  violations  of OSHA  standards at Army installa› tions. Other DOD services can also access this information if  it applies to them. The Safety Center used this  information to draft and distribute the Army "Dirty Dozen" list, the twelve OSHA standards most violated by the Army, for FY 1993 and FY 1994. ·

The U.S. Army Audit Agency (AAA)  introduced several significant automation  initiatives  during  FY  1994.  First,  as  part  of its  efforts  to improve client services, the AAA automated its entire schedule of  audits. The schedule is issued as near to the beginning of the fiscal year as pos› sible  to  include  the  latest  changes.  Previously,  as  a result  of  numerous unprogrammed requests and other disruptions,  much  of the  information had become outdated by the time clients received the schedule. The auto› mated  schedule overcomes  these deficiencies by allowing  Army MACOMs and  other interested  activities  real-time,  on-line  access  that reflects  updated  changes  as  they  occur.  The  automated  schedule  also reflects projected entrance and exit dates and includes audit objectives. In addition, the AAA developed a new feature, the Audit Followup module, for  its  information  management system. This new  feature  facilitates the production of  the  AAA follow-up function Semi-Annual  Report  to Congress. Finally,  the  AAA  incorporated  newly  designed  AAA perfor› mance measures into its  information management system, thereby facili› tating reporting of  AAA internal process improvements.

FY 1994 saw the adoption of a new automated identification card in the  Army,  the  Real-Time  Automated  Personnel  Identification  System (RAPIDS). The new DOD automated card was approved for testing on 1 October 1993. Testing took place at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, from October to  December  1993.  Worldwide  implementation and fielding  of the  new RAPIDS equipment began in January 1994. Eighty-three Army identifi› cation  card  issuing  sites  were  established  in  CONUS,  and  39  outside CONUS, during the fiscal year. An additional 81  Army sites remained to be established in FY 1995.

FY 1994 marked an automation milestone for the U.S. Army Drug and Alcohol Operations Agency (USADAOA). USADAOA completed field› ing  the Drug  and  Alcohol Management  Information  System- Field (DAMIS-FS) to sixteen CONUS installations. USADAOA also created a prototype  Service  to  the  Nation/Drug Demand  Reduction  (STN/DDR) database to  collect information about and  report on the  many volunteer services, programs, and resources Army installations are providing com-

n1umttes  in  support  of Service  to  the  Nation  and  the  National  Drug Control Policy. The findings of the database revealed that of 96 CONUS installations surveyed, 62  installations, or 64  percent, accomplished 154 STN/DDR programs; 41  installations Army-wide conducted Drug Abuse Resistance  Education  (DARE)  programs;  and  overall,  STN/DDR  pro› grams involved 263,530 participants, 56 percent of whom  were  military youth  family  members,  and  3,385  staff members,  41  percent of whom were active duty soldiers or Department of  the Army civilians.

During FY 1994 a major effort was under way to provide automated data  processing  support  for  management  of reserve  component  pro› grams. The goal was to provide improved capability, especially for con› ducting joint operations, of using microcomputers at the local level. The reserve components recognized that on-line communi. cation and interac› tion  with  larger systems  are  essential  to  reduce  delays,  improve  effi› ciency of operations, and make current information available to various L evels of  command.

The  Anny  National  Guard  (ARNG)  benefited  from  a  number  of automation initiatives during the fiscal year. The ARNG implemented and tested  the  Inter-Component Data Transfer (ICDT) process  in July  1994. The ICDT process is a methodology developed to increase the frequency and  efficiency  of transferring  personnel  information  between  compo› nents. The ICDT enables intercomponent transfer of soldiers' automated personnel  records  for  initial  active-duty  training,  active-duty  training, temporary tours of  active duty longer than thirty days, and federalization. It is intended to facilitate loading soldier accession data upon enlistment, to  receive  the  U.S.  Army  Recruiting  Command  Army  Recruiting  and Accession  Data System  records,  and  to  route  the  record  to  the  gaining component. When the ICDT is completely implemented, information will pass from the point of  origin, through the TAPDB, to the appropriate per› sonnel field system within forty-eight hours.

ARNG unit motor pools and  organizational  maintenance shops use Unit Level  Logistics  System- Ground  (ULLS-G)  computer  systems  for managing  unit-level  repair  parts  and  maintaining  ma. intenance  records. After  the  Persian Gulf War,  the  ARNG reached an  agreement with the Army Staff that the Department of the Army would furnish  ULLS-G to early-deploying ARNG  units  and the ARNG would use  congressionally added funds  to purchase ULLS-G for  its  later-deploying  units. As of 31 September 1994, all ARNG Table of  Organization and Equipment (TOE) units had been issued ULLS-G hardware and each state had a trained sup› port cadre in place.

The development of ULLS-Aviation  and  ULLS-S4 (battalion  logis› tics) software also began in FY 1994. With anticipated fielding in mid FY 1995,  the ULLS-Aviation system automates the crew chief requirements

within the aviation flight company and the maintenance and supply oper› ations within the aviation activities.

The ARNG also continued to modernize and expand several areas of tactical automation.  The  Standard  Property  Book  System- Redesign (SPBS-R) is  a means of centralizing property book accounting and pro› viding greater visibility  of assets  to  battalions  and  larger tactical  units. Ninely percent of  the ARNG's SPBS-R systems were fielded in high-pri› ority  deployable  Contingency Force Pool  (CFP)  units  by  the end of  FY 1994. Conversion and training for SPBS-R inARNG tactical units should be  completed  during  the  second  quarter  of FY  1995.  SPBS-R  I/TDA (Installation/Table of  Distribution and Allowances) is a multiuser system that replaces  the  Equipment  Status Report  module  of  the  Supply Accounting Management Information System at the U.S.  Property and Fiscal  Office. This  conversion  began  during the  second  quarter of FY 1994  and  should  be  completed  during  the  second quarter of FY  1995. SPBS-R  I/TDA training  is being  conducted  on-site  or at nearby  active Army military installations.

The ARNG is completely revamping calibration management with the introduction  and  fielding  of  tl1e  Test,  Measurement,  and  Diagnostic Equipment Integrated  Material  Management  System  (TIMMS).  In  FY 1994, TIMMS ancillary hardware,  consisting of smart terminal,  printer, CD-ROM player, and modem, was being prepared for immediate fielding. Fielding is expected to be completed during the third quarter ofFY 1995.

In finance, the ARNG expended considerable efforts toward improve› ment of  the Automated Ftmd Control Orders System (AFCOS) during FY 1994. Extensive systems changes were programmed and tested during the first  quarter,  with  fielding  completed  to  all  states,  territories,  and  the District of  Columbia during the next two quarters. The changes to AFCOS provided program and fund managers with significantly improved control and far more efficient use of  funds available to the ARNG for active duty programs.

The Standard Army Maintenance System- Levels I and II (SAMS I/II) is available in the Army National Guard. This maintenance and readiness management system is essential to direct and general support maintenance operations  in  the ARNG.  In FY  1994  SAMS  I/II  was  operating  on an obsolete  tactical  Army  combat  service  support  computer  system  that required hardware and software upgrades.

The U.S.  Army  Reserve  (USAR)  experienced  mixed progress  with automation  during  FY  1994.  Deployable  USAR units  received  off-the› shelf automation hardware for the logistics STAMIS, yet no correspond› ing  equipping  at  the  management levels  occurred.  Consequently,  there was not an overall net increase in automated logistics management in the Army Reserve during FY 1994. The Army Reserve operates two internal

logistics programs, including center-level application software, which pro› vide  limited  unit-level logistics operations; however,  these have  not been updated due to restrictions on upgrading functions that duplicate those in the Reserve Component Automation System (RCAS).

The Army has historically recognized the modified table or  organiza› tion  and  equipment  (MTOE)  requirements  for  computer  hardware  and software  in  the Army Reserve in organizations not governed by  a TDA. Since the TDA structure of  the Army Reserve includes most of  the peace› time  command and control  headquarters,  effective  logistics  automation management in the Army Reserve is impeded. The lack of internal inter› operability between MTOE units, which include CFP units and TDA units, keeps MTOE units from acquiring the automation usage and experience needed to be as fully trained as their active component counterparts.

Equipping the Army Reserve has fi·equently occurred  at the end of the  Army  equipment-fielding  process.  The Army  has  started  to  equip Army Reserve CFP units in Department of  the Army Master Priority List sequence but continues to equip the remainder of  the Army Reserve at the end of the process. Traditionally, funding has not been available to com› plete the equipping of the Army Reserve.  If this trend  continues, only CFP MTOE units will be interoperable with their active component coun› terparts.  If  other than CFP units arc required for an operation, the Army will  be  required to  equip  and  train  these  units  in  STAMTS  operations upon mobilization.

During FY 1994 the Army Reserve made a transition to a single-source personnel system.  This system, the Total Army Personnel Database--Reserve (TAPDB-R),  eliminated  the  need  for  maintaining  various  personnel sys› tems, such as the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) program, and  the Troop Program Units (TPU), to sup› port the total Army Reserve. The Standard Installation/Division Personnel System-Army Reserve  will  continue to transmit  unit  personnel  data  to TAPDB-R until the RCAS  interface  is  fully  developed  and  fielded.  The TAPDB-R personnel system supports a central database for all three Army components under a single-source data repository. TAPDD-R will also serve as the primary source of  USAR personnel data to support the personnel and pay system interface and USA R retirement repository.

The RCAS began FY J 994 with 381  units fielded with hardware and office automation software and ended by completing the fielding of 1,500 units. The RCAS is a secure, automated information system that supports the decision-making needs of  commanders, staff, and functional managers responsible for reserve component forces. When RCAS is completed, over 8,000 units will be connected through a wide area network. Once fielding of  hardware and applications of  software have been completed, the RCAS program will be capable of exchanging information systems. In addition

to accurate information supporting mobilization planning and execution, commanders at all levels will have the ability to assess training strategies and monitor the logistics functions.

## Economies and Efficiencies

The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller (ASA FM&amp;C) directed an Army-wide study of the Internal Review Program in 1994. Internal Review is a command and control ele› ment that  provides professional audit and  related services for command and senjor management officials. Internal Review facilitates the comman› der's  role as a steward of  Army resources. Internal Review offices provide comprehensive or quick-response audits of known or suspected problem areas  or areas where additional efficiencies are believed to  exist, advice and  analysis  on  the  status  of internal  management conh·ols  within  the organization, additional advisory and consulting services for management as needed, a point of contact for commanders for all external audit orga› nizations, and follow-up audit services to  ensure that audit recommenda› tions  for  corrective  actions were  implemented in a  prompt and  effective manner.  Based on the results of the study,  several initiatives were under› taken during FY 1994. As part of a  strategic planning  effort,  an Army Internal Review vision with a focus on customer needs and high-quality audit services was adopted. The Internal Review Program was redesigned to provide a broader spectrum of audit and related services to customers. Guidelines  were  formulated  for  performing  quick-response  audits  in accordance with Government  Auditing Standards. The Army also adopted an  Internal  Review Awards  of Excellence Program.  Finally,  under joint sponsorship  of the ASA FM&amp;C and  the Auditor General, a program of instruction  was  developed  for  an  eight-hour  course  on  "Serving  the Internal Review Customer" to  be released during FY 1995.

These enhancement initiatives contributed to Internal Review produc› tivity  (measured in terms of audit reports issued).  Internal Review pro› ductivity  registered the most significant increase on record, over 33  per› cent  in  FY  1994  from  FY  1993  levels.  Internal  Review  "value  added," which is measured in terms of  potential monetary benefits identified per Internal Review auditor, registered a 51  percent increase during FY 1994 over FY  1993.  A  $291,000  benefit per auditor represented the highest level of  savings in the FY 1990- 1994 period.

During  FY  1994  the  Under  Secretary  of Defense  (Comptroller), responsible  for  demonstrating  fiscal  stewardship  within  DOD,  empha› sized the  completion  of Antideficiency Act (ADA)  violation cases  in  a timely manner and accountability for violations of the law. An ADA vio› lation is a violation of  statutes included in  Sections  1341,  1342, and 1517

of  Title 31  of  the United States Code, Finance and Money. The statutory intent is to ensure that federal employees do not obligate funds they do not have and do not obligate funds for purposes other than those stated in the authorizations and appropriations acts. The statutes provide administrative and criminal sanctions for violations of  the act. The Secretary of  the Army and senior management within the Army financial community supported the Under Secretary's position.

The Principal Deputy ASA FM&amp;C contacted MACOMs personally to discuss the status of investigations and of  required periodic update brief› ings. Also, the Army Audit Agency was requested to assist in processing of overdue ADA cases and to  evaluate the processing procedures. These actions assisted the Army in  reducing its backlog of  ADA cases from 47 to  25  during FY 1994. This represented a significant reduction from the balance of37 open cases at the end ofFY 1993. The Army took addition› al  actions before the end of FY 1994 to  review  guidance for processing and reporting ADA investigations and  to review programs of instruction to  increase awareness concerning causes of  ADA violations. In  addition, the ASA FM&amp;C completely reviewed the ADA processing procedures to streamline the process.

Public Law  101- 510, FY 1991  National Defense Appropriations Act, significantly changed the way the Army managed financial resources. The law  eliminated  the  merged  account  and  limited  the  availability  of all appropriations for obligation adjustment and payments to five years after the appropriation expired. After five years, the expired appropriation and all  unliquidated obligations are canceled. Payments associated with can› celed  appropriations  must  be  supported  with  obligations  from  current funds.  Prior to  this  law,  unliquidated obligations  remained in an  expired status for two years, after which time they lapsed into the merged account. The merged account represented a compilation of  many fiscal and appro› priation combinations,  and its  unliquidated obligations  and  unobligated balances were available indefinitely for  obligation adjustments and  pay› ment of  liabilities.

FY 1994 marked the beginning of  a new era in resource management because  all  merged  accounts  were  canceled  at  the  end  of FY  1993. Managers  needed  to  develop  procedures to  diminish the  use of current funds  to  pay  liabilities  formerly  financed  by  unliquidated  obligations associated with canceled appropriations. In response to this need, the  ASA FM&amp;C initiated the FY 1994 Joint Reconciliation Program,  combining the skills and expertise of  accountants, budget and program analysts, con› tracting  professionals,  logisticians,  legal  professionals,  and  auditors  to validate the continued need for goods and services that have not yet been delivered. Although  the  Army  previously  used  resource  managers, accountants,  and  budget  analysts  to  conduct  joint  reconciliations,  the

closeout of merged accounts in FY 1993 revealed the need for additional participation  by  logistics,  contracting,  audit,  and  legal  personnel.  The Joint Reconciliation Program wiJ I save money by reducing payments from current  funds  in  support  of canceled  appropriations  and  by  identifying current-year unliquidated obligations that can be deobligated and used for other purposes.

The Resource Management Mcntorship Program (RMMP) is  an ini› tiative of the ASA FM&amp;C that was also introduced in FY  1994. The pro› gram  is  intended to  meet Army Imperatives and Resource Management Future Initiatives for  personnel succession  planning, to  meet affirmative action goals, and to reemphasize supervisory and managerial responsibil› ity through commitment to  employee development. The RMMP is a for› mal mcntoring program with an emphasis on acquiring skills.  It incorpo› rates different mentoring approaches to assist career comptrollers in train› ing,  developing,  managing, and retaining the Army's workforce.  During the fiscal year, 455 resource management careerists (194 mentors and 261 associates) participated in the program.

The Financial Analysis Directorate,  Resource Analysis and Business Practices  Office,  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  for Financial  Management and Comptroller (OASA FM&amp;C), submits legisla› tive proposals to provide conm1andcrs the flexibility to generate additional funds,  maximize  use  of resources,  and  manage  in the  most businesslike fashion  possible. In FY 1994 the Financial Analysis Directorate submitted six  proposals  for  enactment  in  FY  I  995.  First,  the  Expense/Investment Threshold proposal would provide installation commanders increased flex› ibility to  use the most cost-effective methods in meeting mission require› ments by  raising the limits of  operations and maintenance purchases from $25,000 to $50,000. Without this flexibility, commanders are occasionally forced to maintain aged equipment or to lease new equipment at cumula› tive  costs  far  in  excess  of purchase  prices  for  replacing  the  equipment. Second, the Kuwaiti Reimbursement proposal would allow DOD to create obligations in advance of  receipt of  cash payments by the Kuwaiti govern› ment. Although the treaty between the United States and the Government of Kuwait states  that  the Kuwaiti  government will reimburse  the  United States for military costs of  the continued U.S. presence in Kuwait, the DOD cannot afford to carry the approximately $250 million operating cost from existing  total  obligation  authority  until  payment  is  received.  Third,  the Residual Value Threshold proposal would establish a $10 million threshold below  which  the  review  of U.S.-German  settlement  agreements  by  the Office  of Management and  Budget (OMB)  is  not required. This  would allow the OMB to focus on higher monetary settlements and would accel› erate  the  process  for  lower  monetary  settlements.  Fourth,  the  Excess Historical Artifacts proposal  would  allow  the services a  broader range  of

options for  disposing of excess  historical artifacts by trading  artifacts  to compensate for transportation costs and trading artifacts of  equal or greater value with other services. Fifth, the Sale and  Outreach proposal obtained appropriation language that would authorize the use of  funds generated by this program. Sixth, the Residual Value proposal, not to  be confused with the  Residual Value Threshold proposal,  obtained  appropriation  language that would authorize the use of  German funds, paid into a Special Treasmy account as a result of the U.S.  military drawdown in Europe, for building improvements made at U.S. Army installations.

In FY 1994 Secretary of  the Army Togo D.  West, Jr., directed that the Army  Program  Performance  and  Budget  Execution  Review  System (PPBERS) be expanded and conducted as the Quarterly Army Performance Review  (QAPR). The Secretary reached this  decision after reviewing  the PPBERS process and recent legislative initiatives  that  included  the  Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the  Government Performance and Results Act  of  1993,  the  National  Performance  Review,  and  the  Government Management Refmm Act of 1994. This legislation signaled the transition to more outcome-oriented program management and performance budgeting.

From its start in FY 1982, PPBERS served as the corporate review for assessing the accomplishment of  major Army missions through a system› atic set of  performance indicators. The performance measures in PPBERS were  presented  quarterly  to  the VCSA and  the  Under  Secretary  of the Army  by  the  Secretariat  and  the  Army  Staff.  The  QAPR  expanded PBBERS to allow participants more flexibility  in determining core pro› grams, special issues, and related performance objectives and measures. The QAPR also includes presentation to the Secretary of  the Army and the CSA in addition to the Under Secretary of  the Army and the VCSA.

The composition of  the QAPR allows principals to observe how suc› cess or failure  in  one  program  affects  other programs.  Raising program execution problems in this forum also offers an opportunity for  initiating corrective action at the senior management level. This makes the review a powerful  management  tool  for  the Army  and  enables  top  managers  to review, assess, and independently correct program performance shortfalls.

The  OASA FM&amp;C continued to exercise responsibility for  financial oversight of nonappropriated funds  (NAF) in FY 1994 through participa› tion  in  the Morale, Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Board of Directors. The  Comptroller  of the  Army  served  as  the  chairman  of the  Finance Committee and the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Financial Management served as the co-chairman of  the Audit Committee.

The Army  achieved  five  significant  accomplishments  in  financial oversight ofNAF in FY 1994. First, the OASA FM&amp;C established finan› cial standards for all categories of  MWR programs and required briefings by MACOM chiefs of staff on their performance, measured against these

standards, to the MWR Board of  Directors Executive Committee. Second, the  OASA FM&amp;C incorporated financial performance measured against pro forma projections as a criterion for future funding of  major NAF con› struction. Third, the OASA FM&amp;C reviewed the Armed Forces Recreation Center- Europe (AFRC-E) to determine whether the center could operate without appropriated fund support. The review revealed that the AFRC-E should be able to operate without appropriated funds  once its operations stabilize.  Fourth,  the  OASA FM&amp;C established that appropriated funds could be  used to  cover NAF severance pay  requirements at installations affected  by  BRAC  actions.  Finally,  the Army entered into a partnership with  the Air Force to  cooperate and share information on NAF financial oversight issues  and common  areas  of concern  in Army  and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) management.

The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 aimed at producing more effective general and financial management practices in the federal gov› ernment.  Its purpose was  to provide more accurate,  timely,  and  reliable financial  information  through  improved  accounting  systems,  integrated functional and financial management, and strengthened controls. The law designated ten federal agencies, including the Department of  the Army, to take part in a series of  pilot projects that audited financial statements cov› ering all agency operations. The OMB designated the Army as a pilot for FY 1991  and  1992 reporting and extended the project through FY 1995. In  accordance with the  Government Management Reform Act of 1994, Chief Financial Officers Act reporting will  be  mandatory for all  federal agencies as of  FY 1996.

In FY  1994 the Army submitted the audited financial  report for FY 1993. This report resembled a corporate annual report but depicted more than  financial  information.  The  report  included  a  message  from  the Secretary of  the Army, an overview of  significant accomplishments, and a description of  key Army missions and performance. The financial state› ments,  footnotes,  and supplemental financial  information were prepared by  the  Defense Finance and Accounting  Service.  Although the General Accounting  Office audited Army  financial  statements  for FY  1991  and 1992, in FY 1994 the AAA assumed the responsibility, beginning with the FY 1993 report.

In FY 1994 the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held hear› ings on the FY 1993 Army financial statements. Similar hearings had been conducted in FY 1992 and FY 1993 on FY 1991 and FY 1992 Anny finan› cial statements, respectively. In each of  these hearings, the Senate commit› tee criticized the Army for failing to implement the CFO Act fast enough. Although  the  senior Army  leadership  strongly  supported  the  successful implementation of the CFO Act, progress had been slowed by the need to resolve long-term problems that required changes in financial systems.

During FY 1994 the AAA issued 507 reports, including formal  audit reports. These audits identified $1,777,591,083 in potential monetary bene› fits,  of  which  the Army  agreed with $1,397,635,367. Three of the AAA's more significant reports each identified potential monetary benefits exceed› ing $100 million: the Army "Maintenance Float" report, $980,300,000; the "Wartime Host Nation Support  Agreement, U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army"  report,  $199,200,000;  and  the  "Program  Executive  Officer  for Intelligence and Electronic Warfare" report, $123,000,000.

The audit of the Army's Maintenance Float program found  that the Army could significantly reduce its operational readiness float program (a reserve of  equipment) and still maintain equipment readiness. Less than 6 percent of  all Army units reported  that direct-support maintenance repair time affected readiness.  Also,  about 56 percent of the equipment in the program was not considered critical and did not affect readiness. Most of the remaining items in the program either met equipment readiness goals without float assets or had maintenance problems at the  unit  level. The AAA believed that by reducing the program, the Army could cancel about $780  million  in  future  float acquisitions and use about $194  million in existing float assets to fill other Army requirements.

The AAA also believed that the Army needed to manage and reduce its repair-cycle  float  program  better.  The  report  found  that  there  were  no recorded assets on hand to support about $3.5 billion in repair-cycle float requirements,  and  less  than  1 percent of Army  units  needed  repair-cycle float assets to maintain readiness levels. Also, key internal controls, as they relate to maintenance float, were not effective. Through better management and reductions of  items, the AAA believed, the Army could reduce planned acquisitions of  repair-cycle float assets by about $6 million.

The  Army  agreed  with  the  AAA  recommendations  about  the Maintenance Float program or proposed reasonable alternative corrective actions.  The Army partially  agreed with the AAA estimate of potential monetary benefits, reducing them from $980 million to $853  million for FY 1995 to FY 1999. The revised amount represented funds that were put to  better use  within existing Army  programsfunds used  to  buy equip› ment  to  fill  unit  initial-issue  authorizations  rather  than  being  spent  on planned acquisitions for Float assets.

In the "Wartime Host Nation Support Agreement, U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army" audit, the AAA found that the Army was unlikely to benefit from continued expenditures for  military support provided under the host nation support agreement. The AAA believed that the agreement did not respond to a current threat and that U.S. Army, Europe, could not count on support from German units unless Germany was directly threat› ened. The audit found that the Army could save about $199 million if its requirement  for military  support  under the agreement was  deleted.  The

audit also found that the Army needed to improve accountability and over› sight of host  nation  support  equipment.  Equipment valued  at  approxi› mately $80.4 million was not on accountable records, and the Army did not inventory or inspect equipment stored in German depots. The auditors recommended that the Army initiate action to amend the support agree› ment to  delete  the  requirements  for  military  support to  the  U.S.  Army; cancel undelivered orders for German wartime host nation support equip› ment; cancel  delivery of Heavy Equipment Transporter Systems; recon› cile equipment account balances  with  receiving  reports;  and  perform a 1  00  percent inventory and publish guidance to account for equipment.

On  the  basis  of the  report's recommendations,  the Army  disagreed with dropping all  of the  German support groups. The service agreed  to renegotiate  the  agreement  to  reduce  the  number  of German  support groups from three to one and cancel contracts in accordance with a single German support group program.  Since revised force  structure estimates supported  the need for heavy  transportation,  the Army did  not agree to cancel  delivery  of Heavy  Equipment  Transporter  Systems.  The  Army agreed with the other recommendations and reduced the potential benefits from $199.2 million to $101.3 million.

In the  "Program  Executive  Officer  for  Intelligence  and  Electronic Warfare" audit, the AAA found that while the Program Executive Office generally provided adequate life-cycle management of its assigned  pro› grams, materiel developers did not. Materiel developers did not use a for› mal  milestone  decision  review  to  authorize  major  modifications  and upgrades of  some nonmajor programs; did not keep required baseline cost estimates or acquisition plans current; and did not plan to  acquire some systems cost-effectively. The audit identified about $123 million in poten› tial monetary  benefits. The Army  agreed with the AAA's recommended changes to  the program and the estimated potential monetary benefits.

Since 1961 the Army has maintained an aggressive Value Engineering Program encompassing both in-house and contractor efforts. In FY 1994 the program achieved $326.6 million in in-house savings and $40.5 mil› lion in contractor savings. Investments of$32.4 million for in-house value engineering programs and $3.1  million for contractor value  engineering programs produced returns  of 10.1:1  and  12.9:1,  respectively. The  total Army value engineering saving of  $367.2 million represented 43  percent of  DOD value engineering savings.

## Budget

The Army submitted a budget that was in line with President Clinton's planned $60 billion cut to the defense budget for FY 1994-FY 1997. The Army requested $60.7 billion in Total Obligation Authority (TOA) for FY

1994. This represented a $3.1  billion decrease, or a decline of  over 6 per› cent in TOA from FY 1993, not including supplemental funding, and con› tinued a downward trend that began in FY 1986.

Faced with tight budget constraints, Army leaders accelerated planned personnel cuts in FY 1994 to  preserve some critical modernization pro› grams. The budget submission for personnel provided for a smaller force of high-quality active  and  reserve  component forces.  Active  component strength was reduced to 540,000 soldiers by the end ofFY 1994, an addi› tional reduction of  35,000 soldiers from the revised FY 1993 active duty end strength  of 575,000. The  budget provided  funding  to  continue  the Voluntary  Separation  Incentive  Program  (VSIP) and  the Special Separation  Benefit  and  to  expand  the  number  of voluntary  separation tools available by adding an early retirement program for military person› nel.  The  ARNG  and  the  USAR  were  realigned  and  reduced  to  end strengths of  410,000 and 260,000, respectively, in FY 1994, to meet force requirements. The  budget recognized reduced  or transferred functional authorizations resulting in a civilian workforce end strength of  290,257 in FY 1994, down by 18,013 employees from FY 1993.

Quality  of life  improvements such as  upgraded  barracks and  family housing areas, part of  a major, long-term Army effort, remained a top pri› ority in the FY 1994 budget. Army family housing provided $1.25 billion for the operation and maintenance of 165,000 military family dwellings. Barracks renewals at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Rucker, Alabama; and Fort Lee,  Virginia,  accounted  for  $265  million  in  the  FY 1994  package. Another $207 million was earmarked to build, upgrade, or replace family housing at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii;  Fort Irwin,  California;  the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York; Fort Meade, Maryland; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Bragg; and Fort Lee.

Despite reduced f-unds,  the budget represented a  concerted effort to maintain  training  and  readiness  standards.  The  budget  focused  on  the Army's emergence  as  a  power-projection  force  ready  to  meet regional threats.  To  ensure  that  the  Army  was  prepared for  such  contingencies, funding  was  directed to  the  Army's Strategic Mobility Program,  which would rapidly project force anywhere on the globe. At the unit level, fund› ing provided for increasing the training tempo at the combat training cen› ters during FY 1994. Simulators and simulations were  used more exten› sively to supplement costly field training.  Crew-level training maintained an operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of  800 miles per year for combat vehi› cles and 14.5 flying hours per active duty crew per month. The budget pro› vided full  funding for all  known  statutory and regulatory  environmental requirements. The budget continued the Combat Training Center Strategy and funding to improve realism and to increase the number of  participat-

ing units  at  the National Training Center  (NTC) at Fort Irwin, the  Joint Readiness  Training  Center  (JRTC)  at  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana,  and  the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany.

The budget submission for Army modernization provided for contin› uing the upgrade of  Ml Abrams tanks to  M1A2s, the upgrade of Bradley fighting vehicles  to  M2A2s, and the  development of an A3  model.  This directly  supported  the  Army's  initiative  to  digitize  the  battlefield.  The Hellfire II airborne antitank missile system continued to be funded in FY 1994.  The  budget  also  provided  for  low-rate  initial  production  of the Javelin antitank missile system in FY 1994 and continued production of  the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)  launcher. The budget provided for the third year ofUI-I- 60 Black Hawk helicopter multiyear procurement aud continued to fund satellite communications systems, communications command and  control  programs,  and  various  electronic  equipment pro› grams. The budget also set ammunition funding at $734.4 million and con› ventional ammunition demilitarization funding at $53 million in FY 1994.

The budget submission for  the  Army Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTE) program provided funding for several moderniza› tion programs, including the development of  the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS) and the Future Armored  Resupply Vehicle  (FARV);  the RAII- 66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter; and antitank mis› sile  systems  that  include  the  AII- 64D  Apache  Longbow  Hellfire,  the Javelin, the Non- Line-of-Sight (N-LOS), and product improvement pro› grams for MLRS.

Each year the DOD submits to Congress an omnibus reprogramming action that incorporates all reprogramming requests submitted by the ser› vices. Because congressional committees approve only specific items and disapprove  others,  some  of the  Army's approved  requirements  received partial  funding  from  sources  provided  by  other  services.  The  Army's increases  in  FY 1994,  which  totaled  $223,779,000,  were  approved  and funded  by Army appropriations and the balance was paid for by the other services.  The  decreases,  which  totaled  $206,969,000,  were  taken  from other Army programs that were not fully executed.

The Army's proposed $61.1  billion budget request for FY 1995  did not stand on its own but represented the first in a series of  budgets through 1999 based on defense guidance in terms of  missions, forces, and person› nel  strength  resulting  from  the  1993  Bottom-Up  Review.  The  FY  1994 budget required the Army to be at an active duty end strength of 540,000. The Bottom-Up Review would require cuts of 30,000 in  1995; 10,000 in J 996; and 5,000 in 1997. In FY 1995, the active Army would have 25,000 fewer soldiers and 2  fewer divisions  than  the Bush administration's 12division Base Force of 520,000 soldiers. The active Army would be rein› forced by 575,000 National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers organized

into 37 brigades, including  15  enhanced readiness  brigades. These latter units, all from the National Guard, would be capable of  deploying to over› seas hot spots within three months of  mobilization.

Army  active  divisions,  which  numbered  18  in  FY  1989,  would be down to  12  in the FY 1995  budget and would be cut to ten by FY 1997. At  the same time, National Guard divisions that totaled  ten  in  FY 1987 would be down to eight in the FY 1995 budget and are identified at five (plus) in defense guidance for FY 1997.

The Army TOA request for FY 1995 was similar to the FY 1994 TOA but  represented  differences  in  the  appropriation  categories  that  signal changes in focus and priorities. Military personnel costs were lower in  the FY 1995 budget request. The FY 1995  budget request for operations and maintenance appropriations  increased to improve readiness accounts. This increase came at the expense of funding for procurement and RTDE. The FY 1995 budget requested a $1.8 billion increase in operations and mainte› nance funding, from $19.7 billion in FY 1994 to $21.5 billion for FY 1995. The FY 1995 request for procurement would drop $800 million from the FY 1994 budget to $6.1  billion  for FY 1995. The FY 1995 request for RTDE would drop $100 million from  the FY 1994 budget to $5.3 billion for FY 1995. Under the FY 1995 budget request, the Army sought to apportion 43 percent of  its budget to personnel programs~ 35.1 percent to operations and maintenance; 9 percent to the purchase of  weapons and equipment; 8.3 per› cent to research and development;  1.3 percent to military construction pro› j ects; and 2.1 percent to family housing. Table I summarizes appropriations for the FY 1994 budget and the FY 1995 budget request.

Contingency  operations  and  foreign  assistance  in  FY  1994  created unanticipated  resource  challenges  that  had  an  adverse  impact  on  the Army's readiness.  To  support  contingency  operations  during  the  fiscal year, Congress  approved  a  supplemental  appropriation.  Contingency costs,  however, exceeded the supplemental funding provided. To execute Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, the Army was forced to  invoke the Feed and Forage Act for the amount of  $127 million. To accommodate contingency costs, the Army withheld $140 million from MACOMs. This action  diverted  funds  from  training  and  quality  of life  programs  and delayed,  deferred,  or  canceled  programs  that  had  a  direct  readiness impact. Unit training was reduced in scope or canceled, and the purchase of all but priority repair parts was severely curtailed. Quality of  life suf› fered  as real  property maintenance was deferred to pay civilian salaries and  other nondiscretionary costs, such as  transportation of supplies and equipment. In addition, the President granted $56.8 million in aid to for› eign nations  under the  Foreign Assistance Act (FAA),  requiring  the  ser› vices  to  tap  their existing resources  to  provide equipment and services. This depletion of  assets further affected readiness.

As Army forces returned from forward bases to the United States, units were  stationed  at  aging  posts  where  the  infrastructure  was  often  inade› quately funded.  Some quality of life programs, such as child development and family support, were adequately funded, but many other important pro› grams, such as Whole  Barracks Renewal and Family Housing Revitalization, were not. Central support activities that directly affect unit readiness,  such  as  depot maintenance and logistics operations,  were also underfunded. These activities  involve rebuilding and repairing equipment and components and transporting, supporting, securing, and deploying the

Army worldwide. Resource constraints required that the Army defer pro› curement of  modern replacement systems, a practice that increases opera› tion  and  maintenance expenses,  particularly  in  aging  equipment.  Slower modernization also  adversely  affected  the issuance of modem  equipment to the National Guard and Army Reserve, prolonging an existing problem of force  incompatibility.  Modernization of the telecommunications infra› structure  required  to  support  these  central  support  activities  was  also underfunded. Continued resource constraints prevented the timely replace› ment of  obsolete communications equipment and cable plants. As modern› ization resources continued to decline, critical industrial base capabilities were being lost, particularly smaller subcontractors and vendors who pro› vided key high technology components. This added to future weapon sys› tem costs and development time but, more importantly, increased the cost of  spare parts for fielded systems and directly affected Army readiness.

The reserve components also faced resow-ce challenges during the fis› cal year. The ARNG operation and maintenance account was underfunded by  $188  million  in  FY  1994.  The  shortfalls  resulted  from  causes  that included an increase in end strength from 345,600 to 410,000, an increased cost of  air OPTEMPO, and numerous directed reductions during the year. The reduction in air OPTEMPO and flying-hour program affected ARNG aviation safety and proficiency. Ground OPTEMPO mileage was reduced, affecting  the  level  of proficiency  in  some  combat  and  combat  support units. The budget reduction required the ARNG to realign the funding for higher-priority and lower-priority units, which in turn reduced readiness.

The  USAR budget  shortfall  was  $40.2  million.  The  shortfall  and funding  constraints occurred early in  the fiscal year,  degrading training and preventing units  from scheduling training operations. Army Reserve units  not associated with  the contingency force pool  were  not  funded  to execute more than minimal unit training. Equipment shortages continued to  affect  readiness  and  the  ability  to  meet training  standards.  Funding shortfalls  also  prevented  commanders  from  allowing soldiers  to  attend annual training with their assigned unit.

The Army  Program Objective Memorandum  (POM)  for FY 1996- 2001  was  forwarded  to  the  Office  of the  Secretary  of Defense (OSD)  in  June  1994. This POM was  a particularly important document because it provided for completion of the final phase of the Army draw› down  and  for  the  transition  of the  Army  into  the  twenty-first  century. Basic source documents providing guidance for the FY  1996-200  l  POM were the Army Plan FY 1996-201 I; the Bottom-Up Review, published in October  1993;  and  Defense  Planning  Guidance  FY  1995- 1999,  dated September 1993. These, in conjunction with detailed instructions from the OSD to the services on POM requirements, set the parameters for formu› lating the FY 1996-2001 POM.

FY 1996, the first year of  the POM, will mark the seventh year of  Army reductions since the  fall  of the  Berlin Wall. By the  end  of FY 1996,  the Army  was  programmed  to  be  at  the  end-state  force  structure  and  end strength  directed by the Bottom-Up  Review  and  Defense  Planning Guidanceten active component divisions and an end strength of  495,000. Similar goals were programmed for the National Guard and Army Reserve.

A major challenge in formulating the FY 1996- 2001 POM was main› taining "program balance." This refers to  the task of adequately funding each leg of the readiness- modernization- quality of life triad to ensure a trained and ready force. This balance was to  be  achieved in the  face  of what the Army  leadership  characterized as  an "affordability crisis"  that resulted from programmed reductions in the Army budget, particularly in the FY 1996- 1998 time period.

The FY 1996- 2001 POM incorporated initiatives for change that were taking place within the Army.  Strategic changes (post- Cold War environ› ment), intellectual changes (such as  new publications like Field Manual 100- 9, Domestic Support Operations), and technological changes (such as the Army digitization effort) were all factored into the POM to facilitate the Army's  transition to the twenty-first century.

Within the context of the POM for FY  1996-2001, the focus  of the Army's modernization  strategy  was  achieving  land  force  dominance. Toward that end, the modernization strategy was couched in terms of  five objectives: (1) project and sustain the force; (2) protect the force; (3) win the  information war;  (4)  conduct precision strikes  throughout the  battle› field; and (5) dominate the maneuver battle. Achievement of  the five mod› ernization objectives throughout the battlefield is a function of  the Army's ability to protect and enhance weapons systems with four capabilities:  (1) "owning the night," the capability of operating in darkness; (2) digitiza› tion of  the battlefield; (3) use of  smart munitions; and (  4) use of  artillery deep fires. Given an austere fiscal environment, the Army recognized that efficient management of  modernization was required to identify and gain leverage from high-payoff technologies.

POM strategy for Research,  Development,  and Acquisition focused on  modernization,  in  the  first  instance,  by  component upgrade  with  a restricted number of new starts. Modernization is to be executed by force package, a discrete grouping of  fighting units ordered by warfighting pri› ority.  Within  the Army  Science and Technology program,  the  POM FY 1996- 2001 perpetuated the science and technology investment articulated i11  the Army Science and Technology Master Plan. The POM provided core resources to identify and exploit technologies and continue infrastructure reductions resulting from in-house consolidations.

Overall, the POM strategy emphasized RDTE at the expense of  pro› curement, and low procurement-to-ROTE ratios complied with Defense

34

Planning  Guidance  standards.  Many  programs  were  protected,  but  not necessarily sufficiently funded. A concern expressed in the POM was that not  funding  or underfunding  key  modernization  programs  would  ulti› mately erode the technological superiority of  future forces.

## Personnel

During  FY  1994  the  strength  of the  active  Army  decreased  by about 40,000 personnel, from approximately 569,000 at the start of  the year to approximately  529,000 by  the end of the year.  Representation of  minority groups increased slightly during the year. By the end of  the fiscal  year,  African Americans  composed  27.3 percent of the  force; Hispanics  5.2  percent; Native  Americans  .5  percent;  Asians  and Pacific Islanders  1. 7 percent;  and other minorities  3.3 percent of the force.  Also,  13  percent  of the  active  force  during  this  period  were women.

The strength of  the Army National Guard (ARNG) decreased by about 13,000 personnel,  from  approximately  410,000  at  the  start of  the  fiscal year  to  approximately  397,000  at its  end.  Minority strength constituted 25.1  percent of the ARNG. There were 2,930 African-American officers, composing  6.4  percent  of total  officer  strength,  and  59,613  African› American enlisted personnel, accounting for  17 percent of total enlisted strength. Total African-American strength was 62,543, or 15.8 percent of the ARNG, a decline of 1,836 persons from FY 1993. Women represent› ed 8.0 percent of  the ARNG, or a total of32,290 positions, composing 7.9 percent of officer strength at 3,683  positions and 8.0 percent of enlisted strength at 28,607 positions.

The end strength of the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) in FY 1994 was approximately  260,000 Selected Reserve personnel and 412,000 Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) personnel. There were a total of 149,035 African-American personnel; 34,0  l  0 Hispanics; 3,582 Native Americans; 9,086 Asian and Pacific Islanders; and 40,700 other minorities.  Women, representing 18.1 percent, filled 121,770 positions.

## Enlisted Personnel

The  active Army  exceeded  its  recruiting  goal  for  FY  1994  (See Table 2). The objective was 68,000 accessions. Actual accessions num› bered 68,758, or 101.1 percent of  the Army's goal. Key statistics are as follows:

The  USAR  also  exceeded  its  overall  recruiting  goal  for  FY  1994. Compared with an objective of  46,500 accessions, actual accessions num› bered 47,142, or  102.0 percent of the  USAR goal.  Of these accessions, more than 6,500 soldiers transferred from the active Army. See Table 3 for key statistics.

Note: Category I includes recruits  that score in the top 7 percent in the Armed Forces Qualifications Test (AFQT).  Category  II  consists of those in the 65th  through  92d per› centile, and category lilA arc those from the 50th through the 64th percentile. Category IV is the bottom  10- 30 percent. The lowest 10 percent, Category V, arc barred from service.

The ARNG did not achieve its recruiting goal for FY 1994 (see Table 4). Its  total  objective  was  69,710 accessions,  and  it  obtained 61,268, or 87.9  percent  of the goal.  Non- prior-service accessions  of 22,526  were 81.7  percent of the  goal,  while  prior-service accessions  of 38,742  were 91.8 percent of the ARNG  objective. Accession quality was  maintained within established goals with the exception of high school graduates, who were at 84.5 percent instead of 94 percent of accessions. Approximately 54  percent  of the  Guard's non- prior-service  recruits  scored  in  the  top AFQT categories;  100  percent of the  Guard's non- prior-service recruits

had a high school education (84.5 percent with high school diplomas and 15.5 percent with Graduate Equivalency Degrees).

Army reenlistment and reserve component transition programs were very successful in achieving FY 1994 objectives. Part of this success is attributable  to  the restoration  of retention advertising.  Suspended in FY 1991, retention advertising was  reinstated in response to  a dip in reen› listments. An emphasis on command involvement, coupled with a stabi› lized  environment,  also  improved  retention.  The  initial-term  retention rate  for  the  active Army  reached a  high  of 49 percent  for  FY  1994  as compared with  31  percent  in FY  1992  and  46  percent  in  FY  1993. Retention  in  all  categories  (Initial,  Mid-Career,  Career)  of the  active Army  totaled 69,682 for FY 1994. Key retention statistics for FY  1994 are shown in Table 5.

The enlisted d.rawdown program in FY  1994 met DOD and congres› sional  guidance to  maximize voluntary separations and minimize invol› untary separation programs. A total of 10,753 enlisted personnel left the active Army  through the  various  voluntary drawdown programs. Losses from  the  Voluntary  Early  Transition  (VET)  program  numbered  940. Losses  from  the  Voluntary  Separation  Incentive  Program  (VSIP)  num› bered 6,489.  Finally,  losses from early retirement numbered 3,324. There

were no losses from the involuntary drawdown programs such as Selective Early Retirement Boards (SERBs) or Reductions in Force (Rlfs).

The ARNG  achieved  its  goal  to  reduce  the  combined  officer  and enlisted attrition rate  by  3.0 percent.  FY 1994 enlisted  losses of 73,141 represented an  18.4 percent atnition rate. The attrition management plan developed  for  state  strength  managers  was  intended  to  decrease  losses from  causes other than expiration  of term of service (ETS)  and also  to focus  on soldiers  approaching  ETS.  During  the  fiscal  year,  scheduled force structure reductions created a climate of uncertainty and fueled the perception that career opportunities would be limited.

In  FY  1994  the  Army  developed  a  concept  for  a  new  Enlisted Assignment Plan to conform better to  the Army's transition to  a power› projection force. The Chief  of  Staff, Army (CSA), approved the concept, which is  intended to satisfy the need for personnel readiness, ensure the introduction of soldiers  into  the Table  of Distribution  and  Allowances (TDA) force, and enhance the professional developments of the noncom› missioned officer (NCO) corps. The plan calls for soldiers to move after serving three  years  in  continental United States (CONUS) TDA  assign› ments, which are primarily nondeployable assignments. There  would  be no time limit on serving in Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) assignments in deployable tactical units.

In the past, enlisted soldiers have moved mainly to support the over› seas Army. When troops returned to CONUS, others from CONUS went overseas to take their places. This constant rotation benefited soldiers by expanding their knowledge  about the Army.  By FY 1994, however,  the Army's transition to a post- Cold War power projection force from a for› ward-deployed  force  left  only  about 35  percent of the Army  stationed overseas. Without overseas rotations forcing soldiers out of  their positions, CONUS tours could stretch to  more than five years, leaving soldiers too long in nontactical environments and causing NCOs to stagnate and lose their edge.

The three-year TDA tour plan would not apply to all military occupa› tional  specialties  (MOS's).  Some  MOS's with  a  high TDA  population would be exempt. The plan, the Enlisted Assignment Pattern Vision of  the Future,  remained  a  concept  in  FY  1994  with  no  implementation  date selected.

The Army continued to restructure its MOS's  during the fiscal year. In an  effort  to  improve  tlle  readiness  of its  engineering  soldiers,  the  U.S. Army Engineering School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, merged three MOS 's into one. The Materials Quality Specialist MOS 51  G, the Technical Drafting Specialist MOS 81 B,  and the Construction Surveyor MOS 82B were merged into a new Technical Engineering Specialist MOS 51 T. Each of  the three MOS courses had required twelve or more weeks of  training.

Following the merger, training in all three areas was streamlined to nine› teen weeks for new soldiers.

Plans were also under way to rcstructw·e several Signal MOS's. First, the U.S. Army Signal School at Fort Gordon, Georgia, planned to merge two MOS's into one. The Information Systems Operator MOS 74D and the Software Analyst MOS 74F would be merged into a new Information Systems Operator Analyst MOS 74B. This  reclassification  is scheduled for implementation in FY 1995.

In addition, the Signal Corps and the Ordnance Corps cooperated in the realignment of  their career management fields (CMFs) during FY 1994. In FY 1991 the  Commanding  General,  U.S.  Army  Training  and  Doctrine Command  (TRADOC),  directed  that  the  U.S.  Army  Combined  Arms Support Conunand (CASCOM) assume responsibility as the proponent for all electronic maintenance. The Ordnance Corps was designated the branch proponent for all electronic maintenance. The commanders ofTRADOC and CASCOM also detennined that the Signal Corps would retain all operator› maintainer positions related to Signal Corps systems. The Signal Corps and Ordnance Corps were directed to develop training strategies and realign their CMFs concurrently to support the changes necessary to execute the transfer. Phase one of this transfer was completed in June 1994 with the transfer of CMP 29 (Signal Maintenance) MOS's  associated with Signal Corps systems operator-maintainer functions to CMF 31  (Signal Operations).

Note: The Army competitive category includes the 16 basic branches of combat, sup› port, and service support arms.

The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Cadet Conm1and did not achieve its recruiting mission for FY 1994. Its total objective was 4,500, and it recruited 3,924. Of  41,423 students enrolled in the program during  the  fiscal  year,  the  command  commissioned  3,926  second  lieu› tenants.  Approximately  16  percent of these commissioned officers  were women.

The  headquarters  for  all  Army ROTC activities  was  the  U.S.  Army ROTC Cadet Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia. The command consisted of  three regions and 16 brigades in FY 1994. First Region, at Fort Bragg, North  Carolina,  included  six  brigades  and  was responsible  for  schools along the east coast and Puerto Rico. Second Region, based at Fort Knox, Kentucky, consisted of  five  brigades that oversaw programs in the central United States. These programs  included those of the  inactivated former Third  Region.  Fom'th Region,  situated  at Fort Lewis,  Washington,  was made  up  of five  brigades covering  the  western states,  including Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.

Senior ROTC programs existed at military, state, and private schools in all fifty states, the District of  Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Senior ROTC unit strength in  FY 1994 consisted of274 host units and 75 exten› sion centers, for a total of  349 units. Sixteen units closed and one opened in FY 1994. The Army based the decision to close units on projections of a  smaller  Army  and  a  shrinking  national  defense  budget.  Units  were selected for inactivation on several  bases, including enrollment levels and

the  academic  degrees of the  officers  commissioned into the Army.  The units closed were at Georgia Southwestern College; Lynchburg College; Manfield University  of Pennsylvania;  Pennsylvania  State  University  at Delaware;  Pennsylvania  State  University  at  Mont  Alto; the State University of New York at Albany;  the State University of  New York at Cortland;  Cumberland College; Indiana University Southeast; Kentucky State  University;  California State University  at  Chico;  California  State University at San Bernadino; Eastern Montana College; and Northeastern State University of  Oklahoma.

Recruiting efforts in FY 1994 continued to be hampered by signifi› cant  reductions  in  personnel  assigned  to  administer  ROTC  programs. Personnel turnover posed a widespread problem for the Cadet Command. The turnover resulted from  drawdown policies that permitted personnel departures  under  various programs  (Voluntary  Separation  Incentive, Selective Early Retirement Boards, and Selective Separation Bonus) faster than arrivals in the command.

The Cadet Command revised several of its policies during the fiscal year. The  Command formulated  a  new  plan,  "Scholarship Tiering,"  for allocating scholarship money. Under the plan, more scholarships would be available  in an ROTC  program  operating  with  reduced  funding. Implementation of the  tiering program is  scheduled for FY  1995.  Cadet Command  also  received  congressional  authorization  to increase  its monthly scholarship subsistence from $1 00 to $150, begitming in August 1995.  Finally,  HQDA  published an  interim change to Army Regulation 145- 1, Senior  ROTC  Program: Organization,  Administration, and Training, that implemented DOD policy.

The  Junior  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (JROTC)  continued expanding in FY 1994. Initially, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff obtained approval from the Secretary of  Defense in May 1992 to expand the JROTC program in the nation's  schools. The intent was to reach out to America's  "at risk" youth, principally in inner city and rural communities, to  reduce school dropouts, gang violence, and related problems. Congress approved an increase in the number of local programs, defined in law the purpose of the JROTC, to "instill in  students in  United States secondary educational  institutions  the  values  of citizenship,  service  to  the  United States,  and  personal  responsibility  and a  sense  of  accomplishment." Congress also provided for extraordinary financial assistance for schools in  economically  and  educationally  deprived  areas.  As  part  of JROTC expansion and in collaboration with the other services and the Department of Education, the Army  is  also  assisting local communities  to  establish "career academies." Incorporated into each academy are citizenship train› ing,  leadership  development,  and life-coping skills from JROTC. During FY 1994,  30 academies  (20  of them Army-sponsored) were developed,

with another 10 under consideration. The goals of  these academics are to improve the in-school performance of at-risk students in their academic standing, attendance, and disciplinary records; to  increase the graduation rate of academy students  in comparison with other students in the same high school; to  improve the overall quality of the  workforce in  the com› munity in which the academy is located; and to support the long-term eco› nomic needs of the nation through effective investment of DOD  human capital and other resources.

Among the most significant personnel management initiatives in FY 1994, the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (DCSPER)  identified the need  for  a  review  of existing  personnel  management  and  professional development policies for officers  to  develop  the officer corps appropri› ately  to  meet  challenges  it  would  face in the  twenty-first  century.  In response to Force XXI, the initiative to redesign the Army through digiti› zation,  the DCSPER directed that a precursor study be made to  identify topics  that included officer career patterns, officer promotion rates and timelines, officer military and civilian schooling requirements, joint duty requirements,  officer  evaluation  report  modifications,  and  command selection policies and tour lengths, for an Officer Personnel Management System XXI study group. The precursor study is scheduled to begin in the summer of 1995.

In  FY  1994  ODCSPER  initiated  Phase  I  of the  Warrant  Officer Leader Development Action Plan (WOLDAP). The WOLDAP included thirteen-points developed by the Army Staff, TRADOC, and warrant offi› cer personnel proponents to implement the Warrant Officer Management Act passed by  Congress  in  1991. The WOLDAP  included a  strategy to improve  training,  personnel  management,  and the  total  leader develop› ment process for the Army's warrant officers. The CSA approved imple› mentation  of  the  WOLDAP  in 1992.  Full implementation  of  the WOLDAP drove a requirement to restructill'e the Army's warrant officer force from three levels to fow·levels (W2- W5), with a feasible career pro› gression path. An ODCSPER decision provided  guidance to  implement the restructill'ing in  two  phases. All TOE,  modified TOE  (MTOE),  and active component TDA documents were to be recoded in Phase I. Reserve component TDA,  and  any revisions  to  Phase  I Standards  of Grade that were  needed  to  meet  the  Warrant  Officer Average  Grade  Distribution Matrix, established by the ODCSPER, were to be rccoded in Phase II.

ODCSPER initiated Phase I of the WOLDAP documentation during FY 1994.  In  November 1993  the U.S.  Total Army Personnel  Command (PERSCOM)  published  the notification  of future  change  detailing  the WOLDAP Phase I  structure changes. The U.S. Army Force Integration Support Agency (USAFISA) applied the Phase I structure changes to TOE documents in April, during the Consolidated TOE Update.  From July to

## PERSONNEL

September, USAFISA and the major commands applied the Phase I struc› ture changes to MTOE and applicable TDA documents. Department of  the Army  Circular  611- 94-1, Implementation  of Changes  to  the  Military Occupation  Classification  and  Structure, 26  August  1994,  contained instructions for implementing the structure changes.

Implementation of  the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA)  continued  on  schedule  in  FY  1994. Table  8 summarizes promotion rates with respect to DOPMA standards for  Basic Branch selection.

The officer drawdown  program in FY 1994 met DOD and congres› sional guidance to maximize voluntary separations and minimize involun› tary separation programs. A total  of 3,801  officers left the Army through voluntary  and  involuntary  separation  programs.  The  Voluntary  Early Release/Retirement Program  (VERRP)  included  colonels  and  lieutenant colonels with time-in-grade waivers, lieutenants separating with two years' active duty for assignment to reserve component units, and warrant officer MOS's that had a  surplus of  personnel. This program accounted for 61 1 officer losses. The VSIP targeted captains in the RIF zone; captains passed over one time for promotion to major; and chief  warrant officers in grades two and three who were in MOS's  that contained a surplus of  personnel and who were not eligible for the VERRP. Officer losses in this program num› bered  1,374.  The  Early  Retirement  Program targeted  majors  who  were passed over for promotion twice; warrant officers in MOS's  with a surplus of  personnel; majors who were not yet being considered for promotion to lieutenant colonel; and captains and warrant officers who were passed over one time for promotion. There were 673  officer reductions  through  this program. A  Lieutenant Retention Board that considered officers for pro› motion  to  captain  accounted  for  an  additional  450  officer  reductions. Finally,  693  officer losses came from SERBs. A RIF had  been scheduled for February 1994 to consider captains in the 1985 year group but was can› celed due to sufficient VSIP volunteers.

Total  officer strength in the Army National  Guard at the end of FY 1994 was 45,538-1,311 below the program objective. That strength rep-

resented a  1,118 decrease from FY 1993. Attrition for the year was  10.4 percent, which compared favorably with the FY 1993 attrition of  11.2 per~ cent. Table  9 summarizes Army National Guard commissioning sources for lieutenants in FY 1994:

An increase  in  the  percentage of warrant officers was  due  to  force structure changes. In FY 1994 there were 10,169 authorized warrant offi~ cer positions,  compared with 9,853  in FY  1993.  Warrant officer acces› sions of9,011 in FY 1994, however, remained below desired levels.

## Civilian Workforce

Continuing its  contraction, the  Army's civilian workforce shrank by 15,800 during FY 1994, to 341,177. Most of  the reductions were achieved through normal attrition coupled with hiring controls and through use of voluntary early retirement authority and civilian pay incentives to retire. Although  there  was  no  Army  hiring  freeze,  budget  levels  were  again instrumental in reaching strength goals. The civilian workforce includes all U.S. and foreign national civilian employees of  the Army in both mili~ tary and civil functions. The strength of  personnel paid from appropriated funds declined from 323,566 to 306,480 during the fiscal year. Within this category, civilian strength in military functions decreased from 294,217 at the  beginning of the  fiscal year to 279,526 at its end. There were 2,259 voluntary early retirements in FY 1994. Recipients of  the VSIP numbered 4,361. There were 859 RIF separations.

## Special Topics

Recognizing that  readiness  is  enhanced  by eliminating  unnecessary barriers to  service, the Army expanded  opportunities  for  women  in FY 1994. Representation of women in the active Army grew from  12.5 per~ cent at the start of the fiscal year to  13 percent by  its end. Women com~

posed 14.4 percent of  commissioned officers, 4.4 percent of  warrant offi› cers,  and  13.1  percent of  enlisted personnel. In the reserve components, women constituted almost 8 percent of the National Guard and over 21 percent of the Army Reserve. By the end of FY 1994, 91  percent of  the Army's career  fields  and  67  percent  of Army  positions  were  open  to women. In addition, 87 percent of  the Army's enlisted specialties, 97 per› cent of warrant officer specialties,  and 97 percent of officer specialties were open to women.

The role of women in the Army expanded significantly in FY  1994 due to a change in DOD policy. There are no statutory restrictions on the utilization  of women  in  combat  This  policy  changes  whenever  new assignment rules and definitions of direct ground combat are developed. In FY 1993 the Secretary of Defense directed the services to open more specialties and assignment opportunities to women. Women were permit› ted to  compete for combat aviation assignments. The Army responded by opening positions in attack and scout helicopter units.  More than 9,000 previously closed positions opened to women. Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft and some air cavalry units remained closed until they could be evaluated under the new assignment policy.

In January 1994 the Secretary of  Defense announced the new assign› ment rule and definition of  direct ground combat. The rule states that ser› vice members are eligible to be assigned to all positions for which they are qualified, except that women shall be excluded from assignment to units below  brigade  level  that  have  a  primary  mission  of engaging  in  direct combat on the grow1d. This definition excludes women from engaging an enemy on the ground with individual or crew-served weapons while being exposed to hostile fire and to a high probability of  direct physical contact with the hostile force's personnel. Direct ground combat takes place well forward on the battlefield while combat units are locating and closing with enemy forces to defeat them by fire, maneuver, or shock effect. The Army applied the new policy and immediately recommended to the Secretary of Defense the  opening of positions  in eight units.  In  accordance with  the guidance of  the Secretary ofDefense, between January and May 1994 the Army evaluated  other units,  positions,  and specialties closed  to  women and submitted to the Secretary of  Defense final recommendations to open 32,699 additional positions.

In July 1994 the Secretary of  Defense approved the Army recommen› dations.  Effective  1 October  1994, female  soldiers could be assigned  to maneuver  brigade  headquarters, division  military police companies, chemical  reconnaissance  and  smoke  platoons,  mechanized  smoke  pla› toons,  engineer  bridge  companies,  military  intelligence  collection  and jamming  companies,  forward-support  teams  of forward-support  battal› ions,  1st Battalion, 3d Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), 3rd Infantry

Regiment  (The  Old  Guard)  headquarters,  armored  cavalry  regimental headquarters,  160th Aviation Group  headquarters,  Special Forces Group headquarters, divisional air defense artillery headquarters, regimental avi› ation squadrons of armored cavalry regiments, air cavalry troops of divi› sion cavalry squadrons, enlisted MOS 12C Engineer Bridge Crewmember, enlisted MOS  12Z Combat Engineer Senior Sergeant, and enlisted MOS 82C Field Artillery Smveyor.

During FY 1994 the Army also began implementing a new policy of integrating  male  and  female  soldiers during  basic  training. Following a three-month test in FY 1993 of mixed company training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the Army implemented gender-integrated training in FY 1994 at two posts where the majority of  female recruits go for basic train› ing. A company at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, began integrated train› ing in September, to be followed  by  ten more companies at Fort Jackson in October and November 1994.

The Army continued measures to prevent and eradicate sexual harass› ment and racial and ethnic discrimination during the fiscal year. The Army recognizes  that  sexual  harassment  negatively  affects  unit  cohesion  and individual well-being, and Army leaders remained committed to eradicat› ing it.  The Army  implemented ch&lt;:mges  to  its equal  opportunity  program to  resolve  complaints  faster,  document both  formal  and  informal  com› p\aints, improve complaint channels, define the duties of  the equal oppor› tunity  adviser,  provide  feedback  to  the  complainant,  and  institute  an appeals process.

In September 1993 the Office of the DCSPER published Change 4 to Army Regulation 600- 20, Army Command Policy, which overhauled the complaint  process,  established  equal  opportunity  (EO)  hotlines  at  all installations,  and mandated EO training throughout all phases of  profes› sional military education and twice yearly in units. The complaint process reporting procedures were further standardized tlu-ough the adoption of a new complaint form and timelines to pace actions toward the resolution of complaints. In November the CSA reinstated sixteen officer EO positions, which had been eliminated earlier, to bolster support of  noncommissioned officers and EO advisers working in the field. In January  1994 the Army introduced  a  standardized reproducible  complaint form  and  established timelines  to  resolve  complaints. That same month,  the  Secretary of the Army and the CSA demonstrated their commitment to equal opportunity in a joint policy statement. In April ODCSPER began requiring EO advis› ers to make follow-up assessments of  the handling of  EO complaints. The advisers  were  to examine resolution strategies and  the effects of a com› mand's  action or inaction in the wake of  all formal complaints. In July, the Secretary of the Army and the CSA demonstrated their continuing com› mitment to preventing and eradicating sexual harassment in a joint policy

statement. Mandatory unit training on the new complaint process occurred in the spring and summer of 1994.

For  FY  1994  both  racial  and  ethnic  discrimination  complaints  and sexual  harassment  complaints  were  down  from  FY  1993  levels.  There were 691  racial  and etlmic discrimination complaints  in FY 1994, com› pared with  943  in  FY  1993.  Of these  complaints,  165, or 23.9  percent, were substantiated in FY  1994, in contrast with  181, or  19.2 percent, in FY 1993. There were also 512 sexual harassment complaints in FY 1994, 137 less than  in  FY 1993. Of these complaints 146, or 28.5 percent, were substantiated  in  FY  1994,  a  decrease  from  262,  or 40.4 percent,  in  FY 1993. The average female population in the Army in FY 1994 was 70,100, down 1,400 from FY 1993. The average active Army strength was 553,000 in  FY 1994, compared with 587,000 in FY  1993.

In addition to the above  racial  and ethnic discrimination complaints, the Office ofThe Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) conducted jury trials in eight discrimination cases Army-wide in FY 1994. While the Army won the majority  of  these, one  loss stands  out. In Johnson v. West, a Washington,  D.C.,  District  Court  case  alleging  sex  discrimination  and retaliation in the Corps of  Engineers (COE), the jury returned a verdict for the  plaintiff with  an  award  of $3  million,  the  highest jury  award  ever against a government agency for discrimination. While the district court reduced the award to the statutory limitation of  $300,000 under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the court granted substantial equitable relief in addi› tion to  the compensatory damages.

In FY 1994 the Army implemented a new homosexual conduct poli› cy. The  Assistant  Secretary  of Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness approved the new policy for the Army in February 1994, and it was imple› mented  in  March.  The  Army  Homosexual  Conduct  Policy  implements section 654 ofTitle  10,  U.S.  Code, and reflects  the  finding  of Congress that "the  presence  in  the  Armed  Forces  of persons  who  demonstrate  a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an  unac› ceptable risk to  the standards of morale, to order and discipline and  unit cohesion that are the essence of  military capability." Congress stated that the suitability of persons to serve in the Army is based on their conduct. Homosexual  conduct  will  be  grounds  for  separation  from  the  Army. Homosexual  conduct is defined  in  three  terms.  First,  a  homosexual  act means  any  bodily  contact,  actively  undertaken  or passively  permitted, between members  of the same  sex  for  the  purpose  of satisfyi11g  sexual desires and any  bodily contact (for example, hand-holding or kissing, in most circumstances) that a reasonable person would understand to demon› strate a propensity or intent to engage in such an act. Second, an admis› sion that a member is a homosexual, or bisexual, or words to that effect, means  language  or  behavior  that  a  reasonable  person  would  believe

intends to communicate that a person engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts. Under the new policy, such an individual has the oppor› tunity to rebut the presumption of  homosexual acts by demonstrating that he or she does not engage or intend to engage in homosexual acts. Third, a  homosexual  marriage  or  attempted  marriage  occurs  when  a  service member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological gender (as evidenced by the external anatomy of  the per› sons involved).

Applicants for enlistment, appointment, or induction into  the Army under the new  policy will not be asked or required to  reveal  if they are heterosexual,  homosexual,  or  bisexual,  although  homosexual  conduct may be a basis  for  rejection for  enlistment,  appointment,  or induction. Army Regulation 601- 210, Regular Army and Army Reserve Enlistment Program, governs the Army accession policy. Sexual orientation will not be a bar to service unless manifested by homosexual conduct. The Army will  discharge  personnel  who  demonstrate  a  propensity  or  intent  to engage in homosexual conduct. Investigations or inquiries will not be ini› tiated  solely  to  determine  sexual  orientation.  There  must  be  credible information that a basis for disciplinary action or discharge exists. Army Regulation  195- 2, Criminal investigating Activities, provides  guidance on the investigation of  sexual misconduct. All new officers and enlisted personnel of the  active Army and reserve components receive  briefings upon entry and periodically thereafter with a detailed explanation of  reg› ulations  governing  sexual  conduct  by  members  of the  armed  forces. Finally, all personnel involved  with the implementation and administra› tion of  this policy will be trained to the extent that allows for consistent Army-wide policy application.

Litigation  involving  the  old  policy  banning  homosexuals  from  the military continued throughout FY 1994. The year also saw the first legal challenge against the  new DOD policy known as  "Don't ask,  don't  tell, and  don't pursue."  In Cammermeyer v. Perry (9th  Circuit  Court  of Appeals),  Col.  Margarethe  Cammenneyer,  former  chief nurse  of the Washington State National Guard, admitted on a security application and to a Defense Investigative Service agent that she was a lesbian. An admin› istrative board recommended withdrawal of her federal  recognition, and Colonel Cammenneyer was separated from the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. She filed suit in June  1992, claiming the homosexual exclusion policy deprived her of equal protection and violated her rights to  privacy  and free  speech.  On  1 June  1994,  the  court granted Colonel Cammermeyer's summary judgment motion on equal protection grounds and ordered her reinstatement in the National Guard. Declaring the former DOD homosexual policy  unconstitutional, the  court  ruled  that the  sole motivation  for  the  exclusion  of acknowledged  homosexuals  was  preju-

dice. The government sought a stay of Colonel Cammermeyer's reinstate› ment  in  the  district  court and  9th  Circuit  Court of Appeals.  Both were denied,  and  she  was  reinstated.  The  government' s  appeal  of the  case before  the  9th  Circuit  Court  of Appeals  was  stayed  while  the  parties attempted  to  negotiate a  settlement  consistent  with the decision in Meinhold v. Secretaty of  the Navy. The Meinhold case involved the dis› missal from the service and subsequent reinstatement of  a Navy petty offi› cer who publicly admitted being a homosexual.

During FY 1994 the Army continued to treat alcohol and drug abuse. The Army  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention  and  Control  Program (ADAPCP) treated  11,500 soldiers  for substance abuse,  provided 4,119 soldiers with formal educational  treatment services, and  furnished more than 16,000  soldiers  with  general  prevention  and  education  services. ADAPCP  continued  using  tests  as  an  effective  deterrent  to  drug  use, increasing the rate to 1.84 tests per soldier. The 1,130,849 tests conducted during the year yielded a positive test rate of  .8 percent, which was down from 1.01 percent in FY 1993a significant reduction from 10.24 percent in  FY 1983.

The  Army  undertook several  measures  to  reduce  the  demand  for drugs by youths in FY 1994. The ADAPCP Adolescent Substance Abuse Counseling Service (ASACS) contract continued to provide counseling in  Europe  and  the  Pacific  to  Army  and  other DOD  adolescents.  The ASACS program, which provides services comparable to those available in  CONUS,  counseled  1  ,063  adolescents  during  the  fiscal  year  and taught 1,648 substance abuse prevention classes with a total attendance of 54,977.

The U.S.  Army Drug and Alcohol Operations Agency (USADAOA) served  as  the  Army's lead  agency in  establishing  a  DOD  drug demand reduction program for adolescents. USADAOA took the lead for the Army after Section 1045 of  the 1993 National Defense Authorization Act direct› ed the Secretary of  Defense to establish drug demand reduction programs to  assist civilian  communities  in  their  efforts  to  reduce  the  demand  for drugs  by  youth.  USADAOA  chose three community outreach pilot pro› grams at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Meade, Maryland; and Fort Sam Houston, Texas, respectively,  to demonstrate the Army's ongoing efforts. In collaboration with Children's  Television Workshop, USA.DAOA devel› oped an award-winning video, "Brainstorm: The Truth About Your Brain on  Drugs."  The  video  is  part  of an  integrated  curriculum  package. USADAOA distributed 30,000 packages nationwide to reach 1.5 million youths between the ages of  eight and twelve.

Finally, as  part of its  comprehensive strategic  plan  for  drug  demand reduction, USADAOA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, the federal lead agency for substance abuse prevention. This agreement allowed for effective collaboration in the areas of com~ munications, training, program evaluation, and community partnerships.

The Army's weight program continued to  help soldiers keep fit in FY  1994.  All  soldiers,  regardless  of rank,  are  weighed at six~month intervals to demonstrate that they are below tabled height~weight limits (divided  by  gender  and  into  four  age  categories).  Soldiers  exceeding these screening weight standards are assessed at the company level for body  fat  by  an Army~developed circumference  method.  If a  soldier exceeds fat standards prescribed by gender and age, the unit commander must  enter  the  individual  in  the  Army Weight  Control  Program.  The commander is required to provide motivational programs to the soldier, including  nutrition  education  sessions  and  exercise  programs.  As  an additional  incentive  to  achieve  the  standards,  the  soldier's records  are flagged  to  prevent  reenlistment,  assignment  to  command  positions, favorable  actions  such  as  awards,  and  transfer  to  any  professional schooling beyond initial entry training. A soldier who fails to make sat~ isfactory progress toward weight or fat loss can be discharged from the Army under a separation action for failure  to meet the weight control standards.

DOD  accession  standards  are  used  to  eliminate  individuals  for unsuitability  on  the  basis  of physical  fitness  and  military  appearance. Although body fat is a poor correlate of  physical performance, it is used as a surrogate measure of  physical fitness. Lean body mass, or body com› position, is critical in successfully performing the jobs that require car› diorespiratory endurance and  muscular  strength and endurance. According  to  the  U.S. Army  Research  Institute  of  Environmental Medicine,  excess  body  fat  can  detrimentally  affect  a  soldier's perfor› mance. Too much body fat can affect aerobic activities such as running. Retention standards are based on medical research indicating that there is a relationship  between percent of body fat and the incidence  of health problems  such as high blood pressure,  cancer,  and diabetes. The Army body  fat  standards provide  only a  fairly  small  margin of health safety below the maximum thresholds. Soldiers are also required to maintain a base level of  physical fitness regardless of  duty assignment.  In addition, commanders are required to  make every effort to  design and  tailor pro› grams according to what their soldiers may be expected to do in combat, thus  making  conditioning  for  combat readiness  the  focus  of all Army physical fitness programs.

In FY 1994, 2.4 percent of  Army enlisted personnel and 0.5  percent of  officers were enrolled in the Weight Control Program. Table 10 lists the numbers and percentages of  active component enlisted personnel separat› ed due to the Weight Control Program.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint  for the Future

In FY 1994 the Army recognized that it  was on the threshold of  a new era.  As  the  world  underwent  a  transition  from  the  industrial  age  to  an information age, the service realized the need to stay ahead of  that change. The  Army began during the fiscal year to define the parameters of  its envi› sioned twenty-first century force, Force XXI.

The Army conceptualized Force XXI to integrate emerging informa› tion technologies with sound doctrine, reinvented organizations, and high› quality  people  to  make  a  smaller force  more lethal,  more  durable,  and more powerful.  Force  XXI will  be  ideally suited for joint operations.  It will be modular, allowing the Army to generate, project, and sustain force packages that meet the specific needs of  a joint force commander. Also, it will rely on advanced technologies that promise to revolutionize the face of war in areas of  lethality and dispersion, volume and precision of fire, integrative technology, mass and effects, and detectability.  In the Army's vision, command and control on a future battlefield will be based on real› time, shared situational awareness.  Echelons will be more specialized as more people gain access to information, and units will rely more on elec› tronic rather than geographic or physical connectivity.

To transform the Army into this future .force, the service formulated a Force XXI campaign plan, whose main effort focused on redesigning the Army's operational forces. The effort was supported by parallel measures to reinvent the institutional Army and to develop and acquire information age technologies, for which acquisition reform was vital.

Digital technologies that allow the Army to pass vast amounts of  real› time information to all levels will be critical to Force XXI. To integrate all activities  related to digitization,  the Army created the Army Digitization Office (ADO)  in FY 1994. The ADO is developing a digitization master plan  that  will  address  elements  of technical,  systems,  and  operational architectures; acquisition strategy; integration; requirements; and an eval-

uation strategy. The Army also is  working closely with  other services to ensure interoperability. The Army plans to digitize a brigade in FY 1996 and to digitize a division and a corps by the turn of the century.

The Advanced  Warfighting  Experiment  DESERT IJAMMER VI,  con› ducted at the National Training Center (NTC) in April 1994, was the first use of digital  command and control systems and corresponding tactics, techniques, and procedures in a  field  environment. The experiment was designed to  validate "the hypothesis that digitization may lead to increas› es in lethality, durability, and  tempo of operations when digital  informa› tion systems  and  other advanced  technologies  are  overlaid  on existing organizations using current doctrine. The experiment was also designed to highlight an  innovative approach to  initiating and managing the neces› sary and fundamental change the Army will experience over the next few years.  In  the  experiment a  heavy  task  force  was  equipped  with  digital technology  and  linked  digitally  to  a  brigade.  By gathering  data during two  weeks  of intense,  almost  nonstop,  simulator-enhanced,  force-on› force battles with the NTC's opposing force, the Army gained significant insights  into  current  organizations  and  doctrine  when  used  with  new capabilities. The equipment was an example of  a new way of  working that cut across organizational lines, with a great team effort between the U.S. Army  Materiel  Command,  the  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command,  the  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and the Army Staff. The exercise also  demonstrated  that  experimentation  and  training can  be conducted simultaneously,  without  degrading  either.  The  warfighting  experiment clearly  suggested  that  improvements  in  lethality,  durability,  and  tempo could be achieved  by the  application of  digital  technology to U.S. com› bat forces. It also underlined the requirement for continued work on the effect of information technology on the Army's future  leaders, soldiers, organization, and doctrine.

In FY 1994 the Louisiana Maneuvers (LAM) process, named after the historic exercises that General George C. Marshall ordered just before the United States entered World War II, provided a framework to manage the changes occurring in the Army. The LAM furnished a mechanism for the Army to identify new ideas and questions to be resolved and established a basis for consensus among senior Army leaders. It caused selected ideas to  be studied and yielded accelerated feedback to Army leaders.

With the advent of  Force XXI, the LAM concept moved into a more advanced stage of utilization by  the  OCSA, during the year.  While  the LAM's original  mandate was  to  change  the  way  the  Army  changes,  it refocused in 1994 to  act as a watchdog over those changes on the road to Force  XXI. The Army's senior leadership  approved  a  "campaign  plan" developed by the LAM Task Force to serve as the blueprint for the devel› opment of  Force XXI. The LAM process will synchronize the Army team

effort by  ensuring that hypotheses  are  supported by  experimentation› live, virtual, and constructive-to  be able to reach conclusions necessary to  implement the Force XXI campaign plan. The LAM Task Force is the executive agent for this plan and reports to the CSA, while working with the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Operations  and Plans  (DCSOPS)  on  the Army synchronization of the plan. The Army effort to synchronize and coordinate  the  LAM effort with  Force XXI  is  accomplished through  a series  of Board  of Directors,  General  Officer  Working  Group,  and Synchronization Work Group meetings.

In consonance with the overall thrust of  Force XXI during FY  1994, the director of  Army Safety and the safety directors of  Army major com› mands (MACOMs) developed a strategic plan, Safe Force XXI, that iden› tified Army safety objectives and the requirements to achieve them. Safe Force XXI is intended to integrate safety risk management into all of  the Al'my's missions.  Safe  Force  XXI  has  six  goals:  (1)  to  ensure  that  the Army is a safe place for people to live and work; (2) to integrate effective force  protection  processes  into  all  Army  training  development;  (3)  to ensure that force protection is integrated into aU  levels of  doctrine;  (4) to develop  force  protection  strategies  for  equipment  modernization  and acquisition; (5) to structure force protection to  sustain any force mix and support  any  mission,  including  contingency  operations  and  operations other than  war;  and (6)  to  integrate force  protection  into  all aspects  of leader development training.

Safe Force XXI recognizes that Army soldiers habitually face a chal› lenging  array  of hazards.  Safe  Force  XXI  intends  to  ensure  that Army operations, training,  materiel systems, and support services are designed to  reflect the requirements and operational limitations of soldiers as they perform  their  missions  within  this  risky  environment.  An example of a Safe Force XXI initiative is  soldier endurance.  Soldiers performing mis› sion tasks over long periods of  time in fatiguing environments face great› ly  increased  risks  in effectively  and  safely conducting  those  operations. Commanders'  guidance for judging soldier endurance must provide infor› mation on increases in safety risks as soldiers'  performance decreases. A human performance initiative of Safe Force XXI will establish a coordi› nated course of action among the training, medical, test,  and operational communities to provide objective measures and disseminate these as guid› ance to commanders Army-wide.

Joint and Army doctrine drive the Army's modernization vis. ion. The Army's concept  is  to  overwhelm  the  enemy  throughout  the  depth  and breadth  of  the battlefield by executing  simultaneous operations. Modernization  goals  in  FY  1994  stressed  achieving  an  overmatching capability to ensure  land-force  dominance. Joint  Publication  3-0, Doctrine  for  Joint  Operations, published  in  September  1993  by  the

56

Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), became the nation's warfighting doctrine for the conduct of  joint and multinational operations throughout the range of  military operations. The publication provides operational and organizational guidance for the exercise of command and control of  joint forces during campaigns, major operations, and battles.

On  14 April  1994,  two  U.S.  Army UH-60 Black  Hawk  helicopters transporting personnel participating in Operation PROVIDE COMFORT were accidentally shot down over northern Iraq by two U.S. Air Force F- 15 air› craft.  Based on the results of the subsequent investigation, the Secretary of Defense  initiated  a  series  of corrective  actions  that  applied  lessons learned. Corrective actions within the doctrinal arena focused on a  thor› ough review of  extant joint and service doctrine and the accelerated devel› opment an~ promulgation of  joint procedures to ensure that such an acci› dent would not recur. Based on a decision by the CJCS, the Army imple› mented doctrinal changes in July  1994 that were formalized in the accel› erated publication of  Joint Publication (JP) 3-56.1, Command and Control for Joint Air Operations, in November 1994. JP 3- 56.1 enhanced existing guidance in JP 3- 52, Doctrine for Joint Airspace Control in the  Combat Zone, and included specific guidance that addressed command and con› trol procedures during military operations other than war. Under the new guidance, Army rotary-wing aircraft had to operate on air tasking orders or flight  plans  to provide  positive  control  in  highly  volatile  situations. Under normal conditions, Army rotary-wing aircraft using established air› space procedures continued to operate under the control of the land force commander.

During FY  1994 the  integration  and  improvement of joint doctrine continued. The Army was the lead agent for twenty-four publications dur› ing the fiscal year. Table  11 lists joint publications finalized in FY 1994.

Of particular importance during the fiscal year was the development of doctrine  for  information-age  warfare.  The  U.S.  Army  Training  and Doctrine Command led the way in this effort. The importance of infor› mation  warfare  was  clearly  demonstrated  with  work  on Field  Manual 100- 6, Information  Operations. This  new  field  manual  describes  these activities as continuous, combined-arms operations that enhance and pro› tect the commander's  decision cycle while adversely influencing his oppo› nent's. This is the first intellectual step toward a new doctrinal paradigm of knowledge-based  operations  enabled  by  information-age  technology. The emerging doctrine stresses the importance of disrupting the enemy's decision  cycle  through  attacks  on  his  command  and  control  systems. These coordinated attacks use the elements of  electronic warfare, physical destruction, psychological operations, deception, and operational security. At the same time, the doctrine emphasizes the requirement to  increase the speed and accuracy of  the friendly decision cycle through enhanced com-

mand and control. The combination  of attacking  an  adversary's use  of information while enhancing and protecting friendly information provides a decisive advantage.

## Force Development

In FY 1994, for the second consecutive year, the Army published its formal  plan  for  force  modernization  activities.  The  document,  entitled "The United States Army Modernization Plan Update (FY95- 99)," chart› ed the changes that the Army had experienced during the past year as it continued to modernize the force. The modernization vision centered on ensuring  an Army  capable  of establishing  and  maintaining  land-force dominance  on future  battlefields.  The  vision  contained  five  objectives: projecting  and  sustaining  the  force;  protecting  the  force;  winning  the information war; conducting precision strikes; and dominating the maneu› ver battlefield.

More than at any time in the last half century, the Army has  become based in the continental United States, with a much diminished forward presence.  Crisis  response  places  increasingly  heavy  premiums  on  the Army's ability to project and sustain forces  on short notice for extended periods of  time. The Achilles'  heel in this modernization objective is suf-

ficient air and sealift assets. The Army continued  staunch support of  the C-17 air transport and Fast Sealift programs of  the Air Force and Navy, respectively.

Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, along  with cruise and tactical  ballistic  missile  technologies,  posed  increased  threats  to  Army forces during the year. In response, the Army placed significant emphasis on a two-tiered  missile defense.  The upper tier consisted of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system currently in development, which will intercept tactical ballistic missiles at extended ranges and high altitudes. THAAD is intended to provide coverage to defeat missile threats directed against military forces as well as critical and strategic assets such as  population  centers and industrial  resources. THAAD is  scheduled to begin flight  tests  in  1995. The lower tier will  engage incoming missiles operating  below  the  ballistic  space  of THAAD  and  will  consist of the Patriot  missile  system,  with  third-generation  improved  capabilities,  and the Corps Surface-to-Air Missile (CORPS SAM) system. CORPS SAM, which is  currently  in  concept development,  is  intended  to  fill  a  critical need  by  protecting maneuver  forces  and  critical  assets,  providing  360degree coverage against short-range tactical ballistic missiles, cruise mis› siles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and manned aircraft. This emphasis, cou› pled with improvements in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) protec› tion, is intended to ensure improved soldier effectiveness under any con› ditions. NBC improvements  included the  development of the M93  Fox NBC  reconnaissance  system,  the  M40  and M42  protective  masks,  the M43 aircrew mask, and the Ml7 lightweight decontamination system.

Emphasis in winning the information war hinges on having superior command  and  control  systems,  protecting  them  from  exploitation  and degradation, and attacking the adversary's  comparable command and con› trol and decision-support mechanisms. In FY 1994 the Army emphasized the  use  of proven  tools  of destruction,  electronic  warfare,  operational security,  deception,  and  psychological operations.  During the  year,  and looking ahead to the near future, the Army focused on building superior command and control systems such as the Command and Control Vehicle, a replacement for selected M577  Al command post carriers; the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control System, an automated means of furnishing  timely  data  to  forward-area  air  defense  weapons;  and  the Combat Service Support Control System, an automated system designed to  assist the combat service support commander and staff in rapidly col› lecting,  storing,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  combat  service  support information.

During FY  1994 the  Army  continued  to  emphasize modernization objectives  to  improve  its  capability  to  conduct  deep-attack  precision strike  operations  against  any  threat.  Part of the Army's modernization

strategy focused on buying a limited number of  new weapons such as the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Advanced Field Artillery System and Future Armored Resupply Vehicle. The latter is  a  155-mm.  self-propelled howitzer system,  supported by  a  fuel  and ammunition resupply vehicle,  which  is  intended to  provide  a  dramatic increase in artillery fire support. In addition, to ensure the capability to dominate the maneuver battle, the Army emphasized upgrades and mod› ifications  of  existing land  systems tlu· ough  Horizontal  Technology Integration (HTI) and Vertical Technology Integration (VTI). The Army's major HTI effort during the year was the digitization of the battlefield, applying digital technologies throughout the force to effect an enhanced capability  for  all systems.  The  Advanced  Warfighting  Experiment DESERT  HAMMER VI, conducted at the National Training Center, exam› ined the first use of digital command, control, and communications sys› tems in a field environment. VTI allowed the Army to apply an enabling technology within an existing system to upgrade operational capability, to reduce cost, or to improve its warfighting capability. A good example of VTI  in  FY  1994  was  the  Patriot Advanced  Capability  III  program, which  enhanced  the  operational  capabilities  of the  Patriot  air  defense artillery  missile  system  with  an improved  missile and radar,  enhanced system  emplacement  capability,  launcher  modifications,  and  a  remote launch capability.

In FY  1994  the  Army  also  began  implementing  the  Aviation Restructure  Initiative  (ARI).  ARI,  approved  for  implementation  by  the CSA in FY 1993, contained  five  objectives:  correct the  structural defi› ciencies of the  1985 Army  of  Excellence; reduce logistics requirements; reduce costs; modernize the entire fleet; and remain within resource con› straints. U.S. Army, Europe, and Forces Command led the Army's transi› tion to the ARI structure.

During FY 1994 a number of  Army units underwent inactivation and reflagging  as  the  Army  continued  to  downsize.  The  7th  U.S.  Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), long the U.S. military's largest forward› deployed medical command, furled its colors in Heidelberg, Germany. At the height of  the Cold War, the 7th MEDCOM provided care for more than half a  million  soldiers,  civilians,  and  family  members  in  U.S.  Army, Europe. The command staffed 2 medical centers, 9  hospitals,  60 health clinics, 94 dental clinics, and 15 veterinary activities. Also during the year the  following  organizations  at  brigade/regiment  level  and  above  were inactivated or reflagged:  (1)  the  2d  Brigade of the  3d Infantry Division was  inactivated in Germany on  15  January  1994;  (2) the  11th Armored Cavalry Regiment was inactivated in Germany on 15 March 1994; (3) the 7th  Infantry  Division  (less 1  brigade)  was inactivated  at  Fort  Ord, California, on 15 June 1994; (4) the 6th Infantry Division (less 1 brigade)

was inactivated in Alaska on  1 July  1994; and (5) the Berlin Brigade was inactivated in Germany on 15 August 1994.

## Training

Army  training  continued  to  emphasize  producing  a  "Trained  and Ready" force in FY 1994. Realities such as declining budgets, a smaller force structure, and increased participation in peace operations increased the value of  Army training. High-quality training and training to standard were never more important in producing a trained and ready force during turbulent times. The Army Staff  continued to focus on redefining training readiness;  effectively  managing  models  and  simulations;  exploring new possibilities  at  the  Combat Training  Centers  (CTCs);  and modernizing training by  taking advantage of  key technologies to speed the task profi› ciency of  individuals and units.

Redefining  training  readiness  encompassed  many  initiatives.  The Department  of  the  Army  recognized  that  some  operational tempo (OPTEMPO) funding generated by the atmual Training Resource Model, which examines what costs are associated with  Army training, would shift to programs that contained more essential readiness-related items. Army commanders were already forced to maintain a high state of  readiness by drawing  on  the  training  capital  accumulated  during  the past,  living  off Operation  DESERT  STORM  supplementals,  and  using  excess  spare  parts generated during the  drawdown in Europe. This  represented the  greater cause of  a "readiness to resource" gap. Monies not spent directly on train› ing  exercises  had been used to  sustain  training support, such as ranges, lands, and base operations requirements, all  of which were substantially underfunded. To deal with the realities of  the changing world and to man› age  readiness,  the Army worked on a  new methodology  of operational readiness that encompassed the total cost of  preparing a unit to go to war. The methodology encompassed OPTEMPO; training aids, devices, simu› lators,  and simulations; ranges;  land;  and maintenance and  force-projec› tion facilities. The concept was not newit reflected how field comman› ders obligated their funds to pay for readiness. The Army chose Fort Hood, Texas, as the first site to  use the new operational readiness methodology. The  service focused  on a  review  of the tank  battalion training strategy. Tank units are the most expensive ground unit to fund.

The Army intends to systematically validate  this  strategy to  prevent accidental "hollowness." Units in the field will  be measured against this strategy to  determine a rating  based on the percent of mission-essential task list functions in  which  they  are  trained. This  rating, along with the funding profile of  the unit, will present the Army Staff with a more real› istic view of  readiness.

In a move to synergize multiple efforts in the rapidly developing envi› ronment of  models and simulations, the DCSOPS designated the Director of Training  as the general  officer  who would  be  Headquarters, Department of  the Army's (HQDA), single point of  contact for all actions relating  to  simulations.  In  accordance  with this  initiative,  the Training Directorate underwent a reorganization to  form the Training Simulations Division. This division  was  organized into  three  branches  that mirrored the Army's  simulations management architecture: Training, Exercises, and Military Operations; Advanced  Concepts  and  Requirements;  and Research, Development, and Acquisition.

The Army also undertook measures to adjust training scenarios at the CTCs  to  make  them  more  representative  of the  service's needs.  The National Training Center (NTC), for example, conducted a prototype Live Fire Exercise (LFX) with two  heavy battalions,  a trial deployment exer› cise, and a divisional cavalry deployment as part of  a regular rotation. The NTC also developed the "onward movement" package that placed tactical requirements on the brigade as soon as it arrived in country. The greatest effort  at  the NTC  during  FY  1994  was  the  Advanced  Warfighting Experiment, the Army's first attempt to  digitize the  forces on .the battle› field. The Joint Readiness Training Center also made progress during the year toward training the Army by  incorporating rotary-wing aircraft into the LFX scenarios and developing peace enforcement scenarios.

Unilateral, joint,  and  combined  exercises  are  vital  for  the Army  to maintain its training edge. Joint exercises are conducted with another ser› vice,  and  combined  exercises  are  conducted  with  the  armed  forces  of another  country.  Joint and  combined  exercises  are  normally  conducted through  the  CJCS  exercise  program,  which  is  designed  to  improve  the warfighting capabilities  of the regional combatant commanders in chief (CINCs). These exercises allow Army forces the opportunity to train under the operational control of warfighting CINCs. In the post-Cold War era, budget  constraints  and  reduced  force  structure  have  resulted  in  fewer large-scale exercises with thousands of troops in  the field and  increased emphasis on smaller, regionally oriented exercises and computer-assisted exercises.

In  FY  1994  the Army participated in  the  following  CJCS  exercises: FUERTES  CAMINOS,  joint  and  combined  engineer  construction  exercises conducted in Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala; INTRINSIC ACTION, the twice-yearly deployment of  a battalion task force to Southwest Asia; BRIGHT STAR 94, the deployment of  a heavy battalion task force from the 24th Infantry Division to  Egypt;  KEEN  EDGE  94,  a computer-assisted exercise  to  improve  interoperability  between  U.S.  and  Japanese  forces; COBRA  GOLD, an  annual joint and  combined command post exercise  in Thailand, designed to improve U.S.-Thai interoperability and demonstrate

62

U.S.  resolve to support Asian nations in  the event of  hostilities; RSOI, an annual joint  and combined seminar in Korea that addresses reception, stag› ing,  onward  movement,  and  integration  of reinforcing  forces;  DYNAMIC IMPACT 94, a field and command post exercise sponsored by the comman› der in chief, U.S. Army, Europe, to reinforce the Southern Region; AGILE PROVIDER 94, a field training exercise for the U.S. Atlantic Command bat› tle staff and component joint task forces in planning and conducting joint contingency operations; ULCHI-Focus LENS, an annual joint and combined command post and computer-assisted  exercise conducted in conjunction with South Korean forces to prepare U.S. forces to deploy rapidly to Korea; and MARKET  SQUARE  94, a field  training exercise sponsored by  the  U.S. Atlantic Command involving a contingency scenario.

In order to examine the Army's ability to allocate scarce resources and execute its Title 10 responsibilities, the CSA  directed General Headquarters (GHQ) Exercise 94. Set in FYs 1998- 1999, and using pro› grammed  forces,  equipment,  and  strategic  lift  for  those  years,  GHQ Exercise 94 employed a scenario involving a major regional conflict and a large operation other than war occurring simultaneously. GHQ Exercise 94 allowed the Army to test Force XXI concepts in a major regional con› flict and to work out plans for rotation forces in operations other than war. Each of the exercise's four phases included the active participation of the U.S. Transportation Command, MACOMs, and a crisis-action team from HQDA. A senior-leader seminar, chaired by the CSA, examined insights from  each  phase  of the  exercise. The warfigbting phase of the  exercise meshed with an Army Command and General Staff College exercise and incorporated  proposed  twenty-first  century  technology  developed  by Army Battle Labs.

Insights from this GHQ exercise and the previous one confirmed the Army's requirement for early access to selected reserve component units and  individuals  and  the  limitations  experienced  when  the  Presidential Selected  Reserve  Call-Up  is  delayed.  The  exercise  also  validated  the Army's need to attain a complete profile of  units, people, and equipment. As a result of this exercise, the Army began to identify and correct prob› lems  that  arise  when  scarce  resources  must be  allocated in  two  contin› gency plans executed nearly simultaneously. These problems proved par› ticularly acute for combat service support units.

Simulations are the basis for the Army's future training strategy. The Combined  Arms Tactical Trainer  is  the Army's premier  simulator  pro› gram. This program is intended to develop virtual, networkable simulators for training mechanized infantry, armor, aviation, engineer, field artillery, and air defense artillery soldiers. Using this system, commanders will be able to synchronize accurately all  battlefield operating systems and  per› form high-risk and hazardous tasks repeatedly in a safe environment at an

affordable  cost.  In  1994  the  Army  linked the  Combat Service  Support Training  Simulation  System and the  Corps  Battle Simulation,  allowing commanders for the first time to  manage all  classes of supply and fully integrate logisticians into a simulated battlefield.

## Deployed Operational Forces

Between 1989 and 1994 the Army witnessed a threefold increase in operational  deployments  abroad.  In  FY  1994  the  Army  had  anywhere from  16,000  to  24,000  soldiers  and  civilians  operationally  deployed  to more than 70 cottntries.  As the Army has grown smaller,  individual sol› diers, civilians, and units have been deployed repeatedly to execute com› bat operations and military operations other than war.

During  FY  1994 Army  soldiers  and  civilians  supported  maritime interdiction  operations  in  the  Caribbean,  deployed  observers  along  the Haiti- Dominican  Republic  border  to  assist  efforts  to  enforce  United Nations (UN) sanctions on Haiti, and supported efforts to house Haitian and  Cuban  refugees  at  Guantamuno  Bay,  Cuba,  in  Panama,  and  in Surinam. Army soldiers trained multinational soldiers who were to assist in the reconstitution of  the Haitian police forces. In continuing operations, more than 400 soldiers and civilians supported the deployment of  Army forces into Honduras to execute humanitarian and civil affairs operations. Army forces also deployed to Puerto Rico to train military personnel from Caribbean  Community  and  Common  Market  countries  in  support  of Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY.

In  Operation  UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY,  U.S.  Army  troops  deployed  to Haiti on 15 September 1994 to restore to power the democratically elect› ed Haitian government. A1my  forces entered the country without opposi› tion and implemented an agreement between the United States and the de facto government. Peak Army strength in the operation reached 18,401  on 13 October 1994.

During the year the U.S. Army continued to provide soldiers and civil› ians to Somalia in support of  Operation REsTORE HOPE. As a result of a 3 October 1993 firefight between U.S.  soldiers and forces of Somalia war› lord  General  Mohammed  Farah Aidecd,  in  which  eighteen Americans died, U.S. forces were augmented with two heavy battalions from the 24th Infantry Division and a support contingent of civilian employees, and the President  announced  a  withdrawal  from  the  operation.  In  March  1994 most U.S. and UN forces withdrew from Somalia, bringing to an end a fif› teen-month presence in that troubled country. Remaining Army personnel withdrew from Somalia in September 1994.

U.S. Army troops deployed to Rwanda for Operation SuPPORT  HOPE on 17 July 1994. The operation, which began on 24 July 1994 with a pres-

idential order, was the U.S. government's response to a desperate need for humanitarian relief to  alleviate the immediate suffering of refugees flee› ing civil war in Rwanda. By 26 July an Army task force organized around a heavy maintenance battalion was providing clean water to combat out› breaks of cholera, assisting in the burial of the dead, and intebTfating  the transportation and distribution of relief supplies. By 3 August the Army and others were producing and distributing half  a million gallons of  water a day in Goma, Zaire, a major relief site. The respite this provided allowed the  UN  and  other  agencies  to  organize  and  establish  refugee  camps. Additionally,  the  Army  contributed  to  secw·ing the  airfield  at  Kigali International Airport and established a civil-military operations center so that  relief supplies could flow  directly  into Rwanda  and  thereby  entice refugees to return to  their homes. By the end of September, the U.S.  mil› itary joint task  force,  composed of Army and Air Force personnel, had turned over operations to the UN High  Commissioner on Refugees and more  than  seventy-seven  nongovernmental  organizations.  Peak  Army strength had reached 2,415 on 23 August 1994. The operation officially ended on 6 October  1994.

During FY 1994, as part of  Operation SouTHERN WATCH, an Army air defense artillery battalion, a security company, and  maintenance tmits in Saudi Arabia continued to support the mission to enforce the UN "no-fly" zone in southern Iraq. The no-fly zone was imposed after the 1991  Persian Gulf War to protect coalition forces in the region from the threat of  Iraqi aircraft.  Also,  in Exercise  INTRINSIC  ACTION,  which  began  in  1993,  the Army continued to contribute to the security of  the region by deploying a heavy battalion task force to conduct combined exercises with the Kuwaiti army twice a year.

In the former Yugoslav Republic during FY 1994, the Army .had per› sonnel and  equipment  deployed in  support  of  Operations  PROVIDE PROMISE,  AI3LE SENTRY,  and DENY  FLIGHT.  Soldiers assigned to  PROVIDE PROMISE  and  ABLE  SENTRY served  under  the  UN  Protection  Force. Operation PROVIDE PROMISE  was a multinational  airlift of  food and sup› plies  to  the citizens of  Bosnia.  Operation ABLE  SENTRY  supported a UN mission to  observe and report violations of  UN sanctions and to assist in maintaining stability along the Serbia-Macedonia border. Operation DENY FLIGHT  enforced  the  no-fly  zone  over  Bosnia.  American  soldiers  in Operation PROVIDE PROMISE served in Zagreb, Croatia; Naples, Italy; and Kiseljak and Sarajevo, Bosnia.

The U.S. Army also supported a number of deployments to Asia and the Far East. In July  1994 U.S. Army troops provided hospital support at Chisenau, Republic of  Moldavia, as part of  Operation PROVIDE HOPE.  In March 1994 the Secretary of  Defense ordered the Army to deploy a Patriot air defense artillery battalion to Korea. The 2d Battalion, 7th  Air Defense

Artillery Regiment, deployed 772 personnel to the Republic of  Korea to provide advanced tactical ballistic missile defense. Army soldiers also par› ticipated in humanitarian  and  civic action  programs  in  Cambodia, Bangladesh,  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  Indonesia,  Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri  Lanka, Tonga, and Vanuatu.  Construction  and  medical  projects  cemented professional ties between  the  Army  and  the  armed  forces  of those  countries  and improved the nations' living standards.  In  Cambodia, the Army assisted the Cambodian Army in developing a self-sustaining de-mining program. An Army  team  provided nonlethal,  humanitarian  de-mining  training as part of  a train-the-trainer program. Fifty-two personnel were permanently assigned to Joint Task Force FuLL ACCOUNTTNG, conducting investigations, excavations, and recovery operations in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to trace American service personnel missing in the Vietnam War. The Army also  augmented the task force  as  required with medics,  emergency ord› nance  disposal  experts,  and  technicians  from the Clinical  Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.

During  FY  1994  the  AJmy  provided  support  to  civil  authorities responding to a wide range of  domestic emergencies. The service assisted survivors of the Northridge, Calif ornia, earthquake ~md victims of floods in  Alabama,  Georgia,  Florida,  and  Texas. Army  soldiers  supported  the National Inter-Agency Fire Center, a joint operation of  the Departments of Agriculture  and  Interior,  in  fighting  wildfires  in  the  western  United States. During the year the Secretary of  the Army called on the services of approximately 4,100 active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve per› sonnel to respond to these domestic emergencies.

In FY 1994 the Army also made a significant contribution to the DOD effort  in counterdrug  operations.  Even  as  the  budget  decreased,  the Army's commitment  to  counterdrug  operations  expanded.  On  a  daily basis,  the  active Army,  National  Guard,  and Army Reserve  contributed approximately 4,100 soldiers to these operations. More than 200 soldiers and Army civilians were permanently assigned to the three existing joint counterdrug task forces or detailed to federal agencies to coordinate mili·· tary  support.  The  Army  provided  operational  support,  reconnaissance, maintenance,  intelligence  analysis,  linguist  support,  engineer  support, equipment, facilities, training, and planning support to drug law enforce› ment agencies in the United States. Outside the United States, the Army provided  counterdrug  support to  foreign  host  nations  through  regional unified commands. This support included counterdrug and psychological operations training, aviation support, and intelligence, as well as planning and  reconnaissance.  Army  aviation  assets  were  particularly  involved  in counterdrug operations, with  more than  16,000 flying  hours logged dur› ing the first three quarters ofFY  1994.  In addition to flying support, the

66

## HISTORICAL SUMMARY: FISCAL YEAR 1994

Army loaned aircraft to  the U.S.  Customs Service and trained pilots and crews for drug-enforcement agencies. These agencies had a high demand for Army linguists and intelligence analysts as well.

## Army Special Operations Forces

Army Special Operations Forces (SOF) units provide a broad range of military  capabilities  in support of  national  security. These forces  include Special  Forces,  Rangers,  Special  Operations  Aviation,  Civil  Affairs,  and Psychological Operations units. SOF missions include unconventional war› fare,  foreign  internal  defense,  direct  action,  special  reconnaissance,  and counterterrorism. SOF also participate in secw·ity assistance, humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, countcrdrug, and combat search and rescue oper› ations. Many special operations units reside in the reserve components; 97 percent of  the Army's civil affairs units and 70 percent of its psychological operations units are in the Army Reserve.  SOF units are often called upon for service in military operations other than war. In FY 1994 SOF units par› ticipated in Operations  RESTORE HOPE,  PROVIDE  COMFORT,  PROVIDE PROMISE,  and  UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY. The A.tmy  has increased SOF partici› pation in  joint, multinational, and unilateral exercises. SOF participation has also increased at the Combat Training Centers and in the Battle Command Training Program. In FY 1994 each Army corps had a Special Operations Coordination Element to  integrate SOF into corps plans and training.

## MiLitary Intelligence

In FY 1994 the Army played a major role in  joint intelligence training developments.  The  service  cooperated  in  formulating  three  new  joint courses  of instruction  to provide  training  to personnel  that  may  be assigned  to  joint  service  positions.  First,  the  Joint Targeting  Training Program is a course designed to train joint service personnel in the basics of  service-wide targeting and weaponeering, which was found  to be defi› cient  during  Operations  DESERT  SHIELD/STORM.  During  the  year  this course program was retitled the Joint Targeting School of  the U.S. Atlantic Command.  Second,  the  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)  Managers  course  is designed  to  train  both  miJitary  and civilian  personnel  in  grades  E-6 to 0 - 5 and GS 11-14 to serve in a standing JTF, supporting component ser› vice,  element, agency,  or combat command. Third,  the Joint Intelligence Center (TIC)  course is  designed  to provide persoru1el above the grade of E- 5 assigned to joint intelligence billets with essential skills to  conduct effective all-source intelligence analysis.

When these courses were being developed, the A.t·my Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Intelligence (ODCSlNT) worked  to  promote

Army influence in the Joint Targeting Training Program, which the Navy and Air Force initially viewed as an aviation exercise. As a result of  these efforts,  the  Army  Intelligence  Preparation  of the  Battlefield  process, along with Army Field Artillery methods,  were  added to the course to make it acceptable as a joint effort. Training for the JTF and JIC courses began  in  FY  1994. The Joint Targeting School course was  expected to begin in  FY 1995.

Army  Regulation  350-3, Tactical  Intelligence  Readiness  Program (commonly known as REDTRAIN), provides funds to senior intelligence officers to maintain the readiness of  intelligence soldiers, primarily in tac› tical  intelligence units.  During FY  1994, the regulation  underwent revi› sion  to  incorporate  changes  recommended  by  an  Army  Audit Agency report of  29 May 1992. The most recent publication date of  the regulation was 20 November 1984. All commands participating in the REDTRAIN program  concurred  with  the  regulation  revisions  by  12  August  1994. There were four  primary regulatory changes:  (  1)  decentralizing primary supervision and management of  the program from the Department of the Army  Executive  Agent,  the  U.S. Army  Intelligence  and  Security Command,  to  the  primary  commands  participating  in  REDTRAIN;  (2) introducing a REDTRAIN inspection program;  (3) providing for RED› TRAIN programs funded by DA to supplement units' REDTRAIN bud› gets; and (4) opening REDTRAIN to company grade officers. Publication of  the revised regulation is set for the first quarter ofFY 1995.

Also  during FY 1994 the Army's new National Ground Intelligence Center  (NGIC)  was  provisionally  activated  in  Charlottesville,  Virginia. The center's mission is to produce and disseminate ground forces intelli› gence to military leaders and  to provide scientific and  technical, as well as general,  military intelligence to deploying forces. Also, the center will manage the Army's Foreign  Materiel  Exploitation Program  and  foreign materiel  acquisition  requirements.  The  center will  become  fully  opera› tional  by  1 October  1995, when Intelligence and Threat Analysis Center personnel  relocate  from  Washington,  D.C.  Other elements of the NGIC will be  based  at  the  Washington  Navy  Yard  and  at  Fort  Meade  and Aberdeen Proving Ground, both in Maryland.

In November 1993  the Deputy Secretary of Defense established the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO). The establishment of the DARO represented a significant shift of  U.S. Code Title X responsi› bility away from the services. Reconnaissance requirements and money that were formerly designated for Army-specific programs became part of a joint forum  controlled  at the  DOD  level  instead  of at the service level.

The DARO  reports  to  the Deputy Under Secretary  of Defense  for Acquisition  and  Technology  and  is  charged  to  unify  existing  airborne

reconnaissance  architectures and  enhance the  management and  acquisi› tion of  manned and unmanned airborne assets. Directed to assess the air› borne  reconnaissance  needs  of the  United  States  through  2010  and  to develop and implement a strategy to meet them in a timely and cost-effec› tive manner, the DARO published The Integrated Airborne Reconnaissance Strategy in March 1994. This document presented a strat› egy  for  developing  a  comprehensive,  integrated,  and  efficient  airborne reconnaissance capability. The DARO's  strategy addressed platforms, sen› sors,  data links,  data relays,  and  ground stations. The DARO was orga› nized to satisfy the national security community's  desire for common plat› forms and processors and represented one of a growing number of  joint programs to  maximize investment return in  an era of declining budgets. The Army's current and future systems will operate  within this joint ser› vice architectuTal  framework,  created as  a  result of DARO's efforts  and directions.

During FY 1994 the Army established a four-step Army Intelligence Priorities Process (AIPP) for ensuring that intelligence priorities are iden› tified and intelligence support is assessed. Formerly, the Army  Staff and MACOM commanders had no requirement to identify high-priority intel› ligence  needs  based on their Title X  mission. This resulted  in  different, unfocused efforts at the highest level of  the intelligence community. With the Army's focus changing from a threat-based force to a global, capabil› ities-based force and with shrinking resources, the Army needed to estab› lish  its  intelligence  priorities  and  consistently state  them  tlu·oughout the Army, DOD, and national intelligence organizations.

On 4 February 1994, the DCSOPS and the DCSINT cosigned a mem› orandum giving guidance for each MACOM and the Army Staff to iden› tify their  organization's  high-priority intelligence  needs  annually. Intelligence  needs  must be  based  on Army  planning  and  programming guidance as contained in the Army Plan. Annually, each MACOM and the Army Staff develop Priority Intelligence Needs (PINs) based on planning and programming guidance. The PINs are major questions concerning for› eign military forces and technological trends addressing specific countries and time frames. All PINs are forwarded to the Army Priority Intelligence Needs Coordinating Group for review and integration into the Army's  PIN List.  On 13 June 1994, the CSA signed a memo to the CJCS identifying the first Army PIN. When the Army PIN List is approved by the CSA, it is  forwru·ded to  the Army's Intelligence Priorities for Strategic Planning Working Group, where intelligence categories and priorities are identified to  support the CSA's  Army PINs. The approved PIN List is also forward› ed  to DOD  for  incorporation  into its plaru1ing system.  The  Army Intelligence Priorities for Strategic Planning Working Group will assess the  Intelligence  support  quarterly  and  brief the  Army  Priority  Needs

Coordinating Group semiannually. The first annual assessment will be in November 1995 by the DCSINT.

## Nuclear,  Biological,  and Chemical Issues

During  FY  1994  the Army  activated  the U.S.  Army  Chemical  and Biological Defense Command (CBDCOM). The mission of  the new com› mand is to develop and procure nuclear, biological, and chemical defense equipment for American  soldiers.  CBDCOM will  also provide  central management for chemical weapon treaty compliance,  assist in installa› tion-level  restoration and contamination control operations, and provide technical  escorts for planned or emergency disposal of chemical agents, munitions,  and  other  hazardous  materials.  By  October  1994  the Command will include all elements of the U.S. Army Chemical Materiel Destruction Agency.

## Army in Space

Space must be controlled to win the ground battle. Space has become an integral component of  the Army's  technological and operational evolu› tion.  The  success  of Force  XXI  will  be  critically  dependent  upon  the exploitation  of space  assets,  capabilities,  and  products  throughout  the entire  spectrum of military operations.  Space assets  and technology are key  to gathering, managing, and disseminating information to provide a decisive advantage.  Space allows  land-force commanders to see the bat› tlefield  better and to locate and destroy enemy forces.  In an environment of rapid  political,  technological,  and economic change, Army  access to national,  civil,  allied,  military,  and  commercial  space  capabilities  and products is essential to successful operations.

In FY 1994 the use of  space products continued to spread throughout the Armyproducts  for  navigation,  position  location,  intelligence,  ter› rain,  weather,  targeting,  mapping,  communications,  and  early  warning served  soldiers  at all  levels  of command.  Space products  were  used  in every major operation the Army undertook during the fiscal year, both for war and military operations other than war.  For Operation RESTORE HoPE in and near Rwanda, the Army used space-based early entry communica› tions,  satellite  image  mapping,  global positioning systems,  and  national intelligence assets. For Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, the Army made use of all  those  capabilities, plus satellite weather imagery,  radio range extension and video transmission, and secure video-teleconferenc› ing  capabilities  between  commanders  on the  scene  and  in  the  United States, using an experimental National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite. Although a large user of space products during

## HISTORICAL SUMMARY: FISCAL YEAR 1994

the fiscal year, the Army had less than 5 percent of  the military space bud› get and only 2 percent of  the people in military space programs.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

Maintaining the Army's role as a strategic force supporting U.S.  for› eign  policy  requires  the  full  integration  of the  active  Army,  National Guard,  and Army  Reserve.  As  needed,  the  Guard  and Reserve  supply highly  trained  units  and  individual  soldiers  to  support  operations.  The Guard and Reserve provide capabilities not needed on active duty during peacetime, at significant savings. It is  crucial  that the Army have ready access to those units  and individuals  when the nation  caJls. To  meet the needs  of the  nation,  the Army  is  forging  a  new  balance  among  active, Guard, and Reserve forces.  At the start of a contingency mission, active units will form the bulk of  a force, while high-priority·  Guard and Reserve units will provide capabilities not found  in the active force. As the opera› tion continues, a larger proportion of forces  will come from the reserve components,  which  will  support deploying  forces,  backfill  active  units and augment the mobilization base, reinforce sustained operations, and, if needed, expand the Army to meet a resurgent global threat.

To achieve this new balance, on 10 December 1993, the Secretary of Defense  announced  a  major  restructuring  plan  for  the  Army's reserve components.  An  Army  Off-Site  Agreement  was  worked  out  by  senior leaders  of the active Army,  the Army National Guard (ARNG), the U.S. Army  Reserve (USAR),  and the  associations  representing each compo› nent's members. This was the first time that the  three  components have worked together on a major restructuring initiative. The agreement refo› cused the reserve components'  missions. In addition to its traditional state and civil  mission, the Guard generally would be oriented toward combat functions,  and  the  Reserve  would  be  generally  oriented toward  combat service support functions.

According to the agreement, a total of 127,300 positions will be elimi› nated from the reserve components by FY 1999. ARNG end strength will be reduced to 367,000 by FY 1999, and USAR end strength will be reduced to 208,000 by the end ofFY 1998. The Guard will continue to provide the

main combat reserve forces of  the U.S. Army, with combat service and com› bat service support units divided among the Guard and the Army Reserve. Under the terms of  the agreement, most Army Reserve aviation assets will be transferred to the Army National Guard. To implement the provisions of the agreement, the ARNG is reducing the size of its present aviation force by 40 percent. After the full implementation, which will involve the transfer of seven  utility  helicopter  battalions  and  seven  medical  companies  (air ambulance) from the USAR, theARNG aviation force will meet the 40 per› cent reduction.  Some Guard combat support and combat service support units also  will transfer to the Army Reserve.  Overall the USAR will gain 128 units containing 11,062 authorizations from the Guard, and the Guard will gain 44 units containing  14,049 authorizations from USAR.

Restructuring and realignment will not be enough, however.  Like the active  component, the reserve components will have to improve in capa› bility, even as they decline in size. To improve unit and individual skills, the Army will associate fifteen enhanced brigades from the Guard with active Army combat units for training. The ARNG's  enhanced brigades will be the Army's  principal  reserve  component  ground  combat  maneuver  force. Enhanced brigades are expected to  reinforce, augment, and backfill active component units as required by the theater commander to which they are assigned. The brigades are configured as seven heavy brigades, seven light brigades, and one armored cavalry regiment. The term "enhanced" refers to  increased resource  and manning priorities. The Army will ensure that these units receive sufficient resources to enable them to begin deployment to a crisis within ninety days from mobilization. In doing so, the Army will work to ensure that these brigades are logistically supported, command and control  compatible,  and  doctrinally  employable  by  any  U.S.  division  or corps. The remainder of  the Guard's strategic reserve combat forces, eight divisions,  two  brigades, and one infantTy scout group, will  be fully struc› tured but will not be fully equipped or staffed.

Over half the  Army  force  structure  is  in  the  reserve  components, including  forces  in  each  of  the  strategic  force  packages.  The  Army National Guard's authorized strength of 410,000 in FY  1994  was  down 12,725 positions from FY 1993. In FY 1994 the Reserve had an autho› rized  strength  of 260,000  positions  in  the  Selected  Reserve,  412,235 members  in  the  Individual  Ready  Reserve,  and  an  additional  557,247 members in the Retired Reserve.

In July  1994 the Army  Reserve  announced the results of a  concept study  of the  command and  control  reorganization  of the  USAR force structure through the  creation  of Regional  Support Commands  (RSCs). The study's authors proposed to  reduce  the TDA  command and control structure in the  face  of continuing Selected Reserve reductions; provide for  better management, efficiency, and value within the remaining com-

mand and control structure; and provide for easier access to Reserve units and individuals  in case of local or regional emergencies. The U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) initiated the study in 1994 to compensate for the cuts imposed by the Off-Site Agreement. The intent was to reduce the TDA overhead in order to field as many deployable forc. es as possible. The  assessment  of the  USAR command  and  control  structure  recom› mended  inactivating  the  twenty  CONUS  Army  Reserve  Commands (ARCOMs) and activating ten RSCs and three Regional Support Groups (RSGs). The  restructuring would  entail  assigning the  RSGs  to  the  three RSCs that had the largest numbers of  troops or were largest geographical› ly,  expanding  missions  at the command  level  to  support readiness  and management,  streamlining  premobilization functions,  reducing  the  U.S. Army Reserve Command's  span of  control from forty-seven direct-report› ing  units to  thirty-one,  and aligning the RSCs to the ten standard federal regions. The mission of  the RSCs would be to exercise command and con› trol of  all assigned units and to provide full service support to all USAR units within their region, reducing the administrative workload for deploy› able commanders and allowing them to concentrate on wartime missions. The mission would improve unit readiness by concentrating a higher per› centage  of full-time  support  soldiers  in  fewer  headquarters.  The  RSC regional alignment with other federal agencies would improve the ability of  the Reserve to provide military support to civilian authorities. The new structure would also provide federal planning assets to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) planners and managers at the regional level by establishing State  Emergency  Preparedness  Liaison  Offices and Regional  Emergency  Preparedness  Liaison  Offices  at  each  RSC.  An implementation decision on the concept is expected in early  1995, with a restructuring completion date of  September 1996.

By  the  close  of 1994  the  USAR  included  over  forty-seven  major USAR  commands  and  two  direct  supporting  units.  There  were  21 ARCOMs, 7 divisions (Institutional Training),  5  divisions  (Exercise),  1 corps support command, 3 theater army area commands, 3 engineer com› mands,  1 military police command, 2 transportation commands,  1 signal command,  l  infantry brigade,  and  1 medical command.  In addition,  56 units, with 8,400 force structure spaces, were inactivated. A total of  2,400 spaces  were  activated,  with  700  spaces  represented  by  conversions, updates, and reorganizations. These actions affected combat, combat sup› port, and combat service support units.

## Strength and Personnel Management

The FY  1994 end strength objective for the ARNG was  a  Selected Reserve strength of  410,000, consisting of  46,849 commissioned and war-

rant officers and 363,151  enlisted  personnel. The fiscal  year ended with ARNG strength at 396,928, 96.8 percent of the objective and reflecting a decline of 12,991  from opening strength. Total strength included 45,538 o.fTiccrs  and 3  51 ,3  90 enlisted personnel.

The Select-Train-Promote-Assign test program moved forward during the  fiscal year  with  a  recommendation  to  the  director  of the  Army National  Guard  for  nationwide  adoption.  Promotion  policies  will  be changed to allow a state-by-state transition from the grade vacancy selec› tion process now used. Full implementation is planned for January 1996. The program will provide to soldiers selected for promotion and  leader› ship  assignments the Noncommissioned  Officer  Education  System (NCOES) course required for promotion. This approach, already  imple› mented in the enlisted  leader development program, is  bringing the total number  of noncommissioned  officers  trained  much  closer  to  the  total number promoted.

In consonance with a change  in Army policy,  which recognized that readiness is  enhanced by eliminating unnecessary barriers to service, the ARNG moved to open all TDA positions to women in FY 1994. FY 1995 will  see an additional six to eight thousand positions opened to women in the  ARNG  as  a  result of the  new  policy that opened  91  percent of the Army's career fields to women.

## Training and Readiness

FORSCOM had established the  Contingency Force Pool  (CFP),  the power projection force ready to deploy to regional crisis spots around the world,  in  FY  1992. The purpose of the CFP is to  provide a pool of high› priority units to support eight and two-thirds Army divisions in the event of a  national  emergency.  CFP  is  composed of units  from  the USAR, the ARNG, and the active Army. In FY 1994 there were 478 USAR units and 368 ARNG units in the CFP.

ARNG units in the CFP expanded in FY 1994. Two categories ofCFP forces emerged.  CFP units already designated to support first-deploying active Army divisions became CFP I units. The expansion created CFP II units. These units were designated to support later-deploying active divi› sions.  CFP  I  units  were  broken down  into  four support packages,  num› bered  l-4, each package earmarked for a particular division. CFP II units were broken down in support packages 5- 7, with each package generally earmarked for a specific division. This expansion increased the number of ARNG CFP units from  171  to 368. At its peak there were 59,000 ARNG soldiers  in  CFP  units  during FY  1994. ARNG  units  placed  in  the  CFP received additional resources to ensure that readiness standards were met. ARNG deployability was at 95 percent in October 1993. The composition

of  the  CFP  continued  to  change  during  FY  1994,  while  readiness remained high. There was some degradation in readiness indicators as new units were added to the CFP.  Deployability of  the CFP declined to 89 per› cent by the end of  FY 1994. Until changes were implemented in October 1994, deployability of  ARNG CFP units was consistently greater than that of both the active component and the USAR.

The Army Reserve used a concept of  tiered readiness to set priorities for and manage the provision of  resources to USAR units, especially those in  the  CFP.  Based on the  deployment dates required  to  support regional operations plans, the Army Reserve classified its units into four tiers, with a  priority  for  funding,  equipment, training, and recruiting  in  descending order from Tier  I  through  Tier 4.  Tier  I  included  CFP  units  in  support packages  1  through  4,  CONUS-based  support  units,  and  units  with  an arrival  date of  less than  15  days after being alerted. Tier 2 included CFP units  in  support packages 5  through 7,  units with a  latest arrival date of more than  14 days but Jess than 31  days after being alerted, and divisions (Exercise). Tier 3 included  U.S.  Army Reserve Forces Schools, Regional Training Sites, Area  Maintenance  Support  Activities, Equipment Concentration Sites, and  the  remaining units  in  the  DA  Master Priority sequence. Tier 4 included inactivating units. As a result of  tiered readiness, the early-deploying units  received a  greater share of training money and resources. By the end ofFY 1994, the 209 USAR CFP units in Tier I were authorized to receive  I  00 percent of their requirements in  force structure program  money,  while  the  269  CFP  units  in  Tier 2  were  authorized  to receive 72 percent.

By October 1994 the CFP gave the Army the capability of  worldwide deployment of up  to  2  corps headquarters  and  8  2/3  active  component divisions  iJ·om  CONUS  bases, a  force  that included  approximately  540 Army Reserve units,  or 38 percent of the  units in the CFP.  Of these 540 units,  USAR controlled 475  and the  U.S.  Special  Operations Command controlled 65.

To improve  readiness  of  the reserve  components  in  the  CFP, FORSCOM had implemented the Bold Shift program in 1992. In FY 1994 Bold Shift involved  units  from  every  major USAR command. The pro› gram grouped activities to  enhance readiness into seven major programs: reorganizations  and  realignments;  operational  readiness  evaluation (ORE);  soldier training;  unit training;  leader training  and development; training involvement of  the wartime chain of  command; and full-time sup› port.  Excepting full-time  support,  the  ORE existed  as  the second  most important clement  for  improving readiness. The ORE assessed  training and readiness in two phases. During phase one evaluators determined the units'  compliance with existing policy and guidance in  such areas as per› sonnel  qualification,  supply  management, maintenance,  and  security.  In

phase two  the unit demonstrated its premobilization and predeployment readiness through the performance of  individual and collective tasks dur› ing  realistic  and intense  training  experiences. The OREs were adminis› tered by evaluation teams sent from one of  the CONUS armies composed of officers and noncommissioned officers from the active Army, ARNG, and USAR.

In training the USAR had three significant initiatives under way in FY 1994:  the  testing  of the  Institutional Training Division  concept and the activation of  9 institutional  training divisions; the activation of  5 exercise divisions;  and the assumption of command and control of 4  installations from FORSCOM to support training operations. These training resources support individual and collective training during both the premobilization and postmobilization phases of  military operations in peace, crisis, or war.

In  FY  1994  one  of the  goals  of the  Total  Army Training  Strategy (TATS) focused on giving the reserve components the same attention as the active component in training quality and control. In collective training, for example, the Army recognized the need for greater standardization in unit lane training and command and staff simulation exercises, especially for combat support and combat service support organizations. The ulti› mate goal ofTATS was to create a system that trained all soldiers (active and reserve components) to the same standard and basically in the same tasks,  and  to  do  so  with  fewer  resources. The  resulting  concept plans became the genesis for the USAR Institutional Training and Exercise divi› sions in  1994.

An Institutional Training Division would consolidate the U.S. Army Reserve Forces Schools, the Regional Training Sites- Maintenance, and the U.S.  Army Reserve Forces Schools- Intelligence to provide individ› ual  training within one organization. This training would  include initial entry training, military occupational specialty qualification, profession› al development, and refresher training. In FY 1994 TDAs for nine insti› tutional training divisions were authorized, with an  effective date of 1 October  1994,  reducing  USAR  initial-entry  training  and  Reception Battalion  personnel  authorizations and U.S. Army  Reserve  Forces Schools authorizations from 43,500 to  27,500, thus saving about 16,000 authorizations. A  two-year test of the  division is scheduled to  begin in FY 1995.

The Exercise Division reorganization process began in October 1993. Plans called for augmenting the size of  each of  the 5 existing exercise divi› sions from 5,177 to 12,761 to promote combat support and combat service support  training.  Also,  6  regional  training  brigades  were  created  and manned  by  active  component soldiers  to  support combat  training.  The Exercise Division consolidated and reorganized the existing 2 maneuver area commands, 9 maneuver training commands, 3 training divisions, and

the existing  battle projection centers  into  5 exercise divisions  to provide the capability  for conducting command post exercises, lane training, and other training activities. The exercise division reorganization process was scheduled for implementation on 1 October 1994, to be followed by a two› year transition period.

Finally, the fixed-site training capabilities for improving reserve com› ponent combat readiness increased in December 1993 when the Secretary of the Army transferred  control  of four FORSCOM installations to the USAR. The installations were Forts Pickett, Virginia; McCoy, Wisconsin; and Hunter Liggett and Camp Parks, both in California. Funding control was scheduled for transfer in stages by FY 1996.

The Army completed the  interim stage  of the Army Pre-positioned Afloat (APA)  program in July  1994. The APA program bad an armored brigade/armored cavalry regiment (minus the air cavalry squadron), with organic combat support and combat service support elements afloat. The APA program also consisted of  port opening units with corps and theater combat  service  support  capability.  Future  APA  projects  will  further increase the combat support and combat service support capability. Army reservists with the Third U.S. Army assisted in developing the APA pro› gram and providing warfighter overwatch for it. The 143d Transportation Command  is  responsible  for  the  development  of the APA  ship  battle› books, which provide the warfighter with information on vessel charac› terislics, deck  diagrams,  stow locations, and  equipment  listings. Reservists will assist in  the deployment, employment, and redeployment of the APA  program in a major regional conflict. Reserve Theater Army Area Commands will have overall supervision of ship off-load and equip› ment maintenance after the APA  assets  arrive at theater base reception points. The final APA package, in FY 1998, will include seven unit sets of equipment  for  reserve  component  units  to  use.  Reservists  can  be expected to play a significant role in APA exercises both within and out› side CONUS.

The ARNG faced  considerable  training  challenges  and  changes  in FY  1994.  The ARNG participated fully  in the development and  imple› mentation  of the Total Army  School System (TASS).  As the  new fiscal year began, so did the test and evaluation of the prototype TASS  region. The primary benefit will  be a reduction of training redundancies due to the  rcgionalization of training institutions. In addition,  the Training and Doctrine Command will act as the executive agent for school accredita› tion, ensuring training to one standard.

The pilot Officer Candidate School program conducted in  1993  for the ARNG was continued in  1994, with all states conducting portions of the program's training at consolidated sites. This concept builds upon the considerable resources already dedicated to the Reserve Officer Training

Corps advanced  camp  mission,  the  mandatory  six-week training  camp required for cadet commissioning, and results in standardized training at reduced cost.

FY 1994 was  also  a  year of progressive change for ARNG enlisted leader  development.  First, enlisted  ARNG  soldiers  benefited  from improvements made at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major  Academy. The acad› emy updated the programs of instruction for both the basic and advanced noncommissioned  officer courses.  Phase  I  of these  courses  became  the promotion standard in FY 1994. Second, the Guard initiated action to treat military technicians in the same manner as traditional M-day soldiers.

Plans  were  also  completed  for  the  implementation  of the  "Select, Train, Promote, and Assign" policy for the ARNG during the fiscal year. In the  future,  only  soldiers  on  a  promotion list  for  CtuTent  or projected vacancies will be trained. Future NCOES requirements will be identified from promotion lists. This system will establish viable priorities for train·· ing and will ensure that funding supports actual training requirements.

The ARNG continued to expand the use of simulations, simulators, and advanced training devices and technologies to  improve readiness in 1994.  GUARDFIST  I,  a  precision tank gunnery  trainer,  is  being  acquired solely  for  reserve  component use.  This  strap-on  training  device  allows units to train in their armories without ranges or targetry. Once the devices are fielded,  organic unit personnel will be used to conduct unit training. GUARDFIST  II,  an  artillery  trainer,  is  being  developed  in  response  to reserve component training challenges. GUARDFtST II has two trainer con› figurations: a one-to-one version used to instruct one individual at a time and a one-to-thirty version used for group instruction.

The TATS incorporates the use of simulations and simulators and is the basis for the simulation fielding plan to support the five reserve com› ponent  division  Battle  Projection  Centers  (BPCs).  The  fielding of JANUS, the Army's battle-focused trainer, and Brigade/Battalion Battle Simulation (BBS) to the BPCs in FY 1994 greatly augmented the reserve components' ability  to  maintain  the  combat  readiness  of their  units. Fielding includes transit cases for each system, providing a dual capabil› ity  for  units  to  train  at  either  home  station  or  the  BPC.  The  Brigade Command Battle  Staff Training  (BCBST)  team  trains  ARNG  ground combat maneuver brigades in battle staff tasks using BBS to drive com~ mand post exercises. BCBST also uses JANUS to support seminar train› ing  in  preparation for  each  command  post  exercise.  Fourteen BCBST seminars were conducted in FY 1994. Two reserve component division› level  Battle  Command Training  Program  (BCTP)  seminars  were  con› ducted  in  FY  1994.  The  49th  Armored  Division  and  29th  Infantry Division  (Light)  commanders  and  their  staffs  participated  in  five-day seminars  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas.  The  218th  Infantry  Brigade

(Mechanized) (South Carolina ARNG) participated with the active com› ponents during a divisional BCTP Warfighter Exercise. The 42d (Light), 34th (Light), and 40th (Mechanized) Infantry Divisions conducted divi› sion-level BCTP Warfighter Exercises during the year.

A  combination  of  existing  Army  technologies  and  development efforts were being explored in FY 1994 for possible use  by  the ARNG. The design parameters for these efforts included timeliness, availability, and affordability; minimization of  operating personnel overhead; extend› ed disttibution of  training opportunities; and realistic programs for battle or combat training centers. One such program, Simulation in Training for Advanced Readiness (SIMITAR),  is  a congressionally mandated ARNG and Advanced  Research  Projects Agency  (ARPA)  advanced  simulation program.  It was  established  in  I  992  to  apply  advanced  technology  to increase  training  levels  of ARNG Roundout and  Roundup  Brigades  by 200 to 300 percent. SIMITAR was subsequently adopted as an advanced technology  demonstration  under  Department  of Defense  Science  and Technology  Thrust  No. 6  (Synthetic  Environments).  The  overarching intent of SIMITAR is to leverage selected development of  more objective measures  of performance  and  effectiveness;  opportunities  for  battalion and  brigade  command and  staff battlefield synchronization skills;  low› cost simulators and simulations to enhance small-unit collective training; opportunities to exercise collective and individual combat service support skills; and technologies and programs for local individual functional train› ing for key personnel. The 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Georgia ARNG,  and  the  116th  Armored  Brigade,  Idaho  ARNG  and  Oregon ARNG, are the two experimental brigades. The !55th Armored Brigade, Mississippi  ARNG,  and  218th  Infantry  Brigade  (Mechanized),  South Carolina ARNG, are the two comparison brigades. All four are scheduled for futtu·e National Training Center rotations.

FY 1994 SIMITAR accomplishments included modifying JANUS to add  to  the  capability for  conducting distributed exercises and  increasing the  degree  of  Combat Support and  Combat Service Support interaction; modifying armories, installing phone wire, selecting hardware, and pur› chasing  and  delivering  commercial  off-the-shelf computer  systems  for .JANUS; developing the first two battalion scenarios to be used in JANUS and  SIMNET  through  the  ARPA  Reconfigurable  Simulator  Initiative; beginning  development  of a  brigade  scenario  for  Simulation  Brigade Armor Training; funding early fielding of  GuARD  FIST I to the test brigade; and  developing  the  ARPA  Reconfigurable  Simulator  Initiative  to  give each brigade Ml, M2, and scout vehicle crew simulators.

There were minor fluctuations in overall unit resources and training levels  in  the ARNG between the October 1993  and October  1994 Unit Status Reports (USRs). These fluctuations were attributable to  seasonal

trends and implementation of the revised Army Regulation 220- 1, Unit Status  Reporting, which  incorporated  FY  1993 National  Defense Authorization Act Title XI mandates of developing one Army standard for  deployment,  readiness,  and  quality.  The  first  USRs,  based  on  the revised AR 220-1, reflected a minor overall degradation of2 percent in January and again in April. Between the April and October USRs, over› all status  remained  unchanged.  During  the  year  equipment  on  hand declined by  1 percent and personnel by 6 percent. Personnel trends were the  result of  Title  XI  mandates.  The new reporting has  provided better accountability  of nondeployable  categories.  The  October  l 994  USRs reported 50,633 nondeployable soldiers, both temporary and permanent, in theARNG.

Between the October 1993 and October 1994 USRs, overall readiness declined by 3 percent in the  186 ARNG CFP support package 1- 4 units, which are the highest priority units in the ARNG. This was due to a 2 per› cent decline  in  equipment and  a 4  percent decline  in personnel. During this time, however, equipment serviceability increased by 3 percent. At the same time the  196 CFP support package 5- 7  units,  the combat support and combat service support units that support the three and one-third divi› sion Early Reinforcing Force, declined in overall unit status by 2 percent. This decline was attributable to  a 5 percent decrease in personnel. There was a 2 percent increase in equipment on hand and a 1 percent increase in training.

The ARNG Roundout/Roundup  Brigades  increased  by  8 percent in overall  unit resources  and  training  levels  between  the October  1993 and October  1994  USRs. There  was  a  6  percent  increase  in  equipment on hand, 5 percent in equipment serviceability, and 6 percent in personnel. Training declined by 2 percent. Increases in equipment serviceability were also  driven  by  the Army  regulation change.  Equipment serviceability is now based on all on-hand equipment versus wartime requirements.

Reserve components must receive equipment upgrades, system mod› ernization, and product improvements to be effective on the battlefield. In FY 1994, due to  fiscal  constraints, the  reserve components experienced training equipment shortages in  a variety of  weapons and vehicles. In the ARNG, Bradley fighting  vehicles  and  armor and  field artillery  trainers highlighted  training  equipment  shortages.  In  the USAR  howitzers, machine guns, pistols, tanks, personnel carriers, trucks, and tractors stood out as the most prominent equipment shortages.

## Mobilization

USAR and ARNG  soldiers  participated  in a  number of liaison and contingency  operations  overseas  during  FY  1994.  The  ARNG  and  the

USAR became involved in the Joint Military-to-Military Contact program in June  1993. The ARNG participated in the program under the auspices of the National  Guard State Partnership Program. ARNG members pro› vided  traveling  contact teams,  seminar participants, and  adjutant gener› al/state governor visits to Central and Eastern European countries, as well as  hosting  numerous  familiarization  tours  to  the  partner  states  in  the United  States.  Under  this  program  approximately  150  ARNG  soldiers deployed  overseas to various  countries,  including  Albania,  Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech  Republic,  Estonia,  Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The USAR participated in the Joint Military-to-Military Contact pro› gram by sending members and chiefs of  military liaison teams to Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and other former Soviet Bloc countries during  the year. Army reservists also  were part of overseas traveling contact teams, sharing their expertise in medicine, engi› neering,  reserve  force  structure,  and  civil  affairs,  with  an  emphasis  on refugee  operations,  emergency planning,  and  disaster relief.  More than 6,000 Army reservists participated in humanitarian assistance and  host› nation support missions under the Military-to-Military Contact program. This  program  and  the  overseas  deployment  training  program  enabled Army reservists to participate in operations in Eastern Europe and Central and South America. Numerous medical readiness training exercises and host-nation  support  operations  were  conducted  in  Central  and  South America.  The  largest  host-nation  support  operation  was  FUERTES CAMINOS, which included road repair and expansion, water well drilling, airport runway repair, and road and bridge construction.

In FY  1994 the ARNG deployed military police platoons to Panama and Honduras to augment existing forces. Nearly 350 medical personnel deployed to the U.S. Southern  Command  and  the  U.S.  Atlantic Command to provide medical aild dental care and preventive medicine education  to  local  populations.  Approximately  6,200  ARNG  soldiers deployed overseas to conduct humanitarian and civic activities and host› nation missions. ARNG mobile training  teams deployed to Somalia to train  coalition  forces  on  the  M60  tank  and AH- 15  helicopter  and  to shrink-wrap U.S.  aircraft for redeployment. Although no ARNG forces were deployed to  Haiti  for  Operation UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY  because  of the averted invasion, the ARNG activated three military police compa› nies to provide backfill units at three Army installations that deployed to Haiti.  Also,  Camp  Santiago,  Puerto  Rico,  an  ARNG  installation,  was used by FORSCOM, the Special Operations Command, and the Atlantic Command as the training site to prepare Caribbean coalition forces and the multinational peacekeeping forces for Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY.

The ARNG and USAR prepared to participate in the United Nations Multinational Force and Observers Sinai  mission during the year. A three› component composite  ARNG  battalion  was  constituted  at  Fort  Bragg, North  Carolina, and  began to  train.  The  battalion  had  110 active Army, 401  National  Guard, and  38 Army Reserve soldiers. These  soldiers  are scheduled to deploy for a six-month mission in FY  1995.

The Army Reserve provided support for Operation PRovmE PROMISE with  three  rotations oC parachute  riggers that prepared  supplies  for Bosnian  airdrop.  Fifleen Army  Reserve  soldiers  assisted  UN  teams  in monitoring  Iraqi  compliance  with  UN  sanctions.  Army  Reserve  civil affairs,  civil  engineer,  and  medical services personnel  provided  support for Operation UPHOLD  DLlMOCRACY  and  Operation SuPPORT  DEMOCRACY, the U.S. and  allied  sea  enforcement  of UN  sanctions  against  Haiti. Nineteen  of the  paratroopers  who  look  part  in  the  recalled  parachute assault on Haiti were not members of  the 82d Airborne Division but Army reservists  from  the 450th  Civil  Affairs  Battalion  (Airborne).  An  Army Reserve  postal  unit  went  to  Somalia  within  a  few  weeks  of the  U.S. deployment  there,  as  did  civil  a:fTairs  specialists,  who  met with  Somali clan leaders.

During  the  fiscal  year  Army  National  Guard  units  participated  in more than 721  mobilization exercises conducted by State Area Command Headquarters. Forty-nine units participated in a Headquarters, Department of  the Army (IIQDA), exercise, OPTIMAL Focus 94, designed to  evaluate  a  unit's ability  to  conduct  home  station  mobilization tasks. Nineteen units participated in CALL FORWARD 94, an IIQDA mobilization station exercise at Fort Lewis, Washington.

Finally, as America's Europe-based military units were drawing down and  returning  to  the United States in  FY  1994,  the  reserve components played a significant role.  More than 5,000 USAR soldiers and more than 3,300 National Guardsmen took part in programs to handle the repair and shipment of  equipment from Europe back to the United States.

## Reserve Component Support to Civil Authorities

Soldiers  from  the  reserve  components  were  actively involved in responding to hundreds of  natural disasters and emergency missions in FY 1994.  More  than  27,801  soldiers  of the  Army  and  Air National  Guard answered the call to 402 emergency missions in forty-eight states and ter› ritories during the year. The USAR, meanwhile, cooperated with the active Army and the ARNG in combating western wildfires during the year.

The  California  National  Guard  activated  and  deployed  more  than 2,600 Army and Air National Guard soldiers on state active duty during the  emergency  following  the  Northridge  earthquake.  The  earthquake,

which  struck  on  17  January,  measured 6.7  on  the  Richter  Scale. Thousands of  aftershocks followed the original earthquake, many of  them exceeding 5.0.  Sixty-one people died and more than 18,000 were injured. More  than  21,000  houses  and  apartments  were  rendered  uninhabitable. Numerous water systems and  other utilities failed,  and many key  roads were damaged. During the peak of  the response, the Guard provided logis› tics support to disaster relief centers, command and control expertise for the governor's otJice, area damage assessment, liaison to key state agen› cies, transportation for military and law enforcement personnel and equip› ment,  use  of armories  as  temporary  shelters,  linguist  support,  potable water, and soldiers to reestablish public order.

Heavy snowstorms and subfreezing temperatures throughout the east› ern United  States in January  brought repeated calls for National  Guard help. Guard soldiers from thirteen states were called out to assist in every› thing from snow removal, to evacuation of  residents in danger, to assisting the American Red  Cross. The troops hauled water to  residents and facili› ties left waterless due to frozen pipes and wells, opened armories as emer› gency  shelters  for  the  homeless,  cleared  roads  of snow and debris,  and evacuated elderly  residents or those without power.  In some cases Guard members also used primary and backup power generators to pump water to residents without power.

Kentucky had the biggest National Guard call-up, with  1,143  mem› bers providing emergency snow support.  Other states whose Guard units supported emergency  operations  were  Alabama, Arizona,  Indiana, New Jersey, New  York,  North  Carolina,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

In July  1994 Tropical  Storm Alberto  stalled  over  central Alabama, Georgia, and the Florida panhandle, bringing severe flooding that caused 33 deaths  and  forcing  approximately  40,000  people  to  evacuate  their homes.  Two  hundred  thousand · people  lost potable  water service.  More than 4,600 National  Guard soldiers were used by state governors to sup› port evacuations, purify and distribute water, transport relief  supplies, and control traffic.

In  the summer of 1994 the active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve were  all  involved in supporting the National Inter-Agency Fire Center,  a  joint  operation  of the  Departments  of Agriculture  and  the Interior, in fighting wildfires in  the western United States. In addition to several active Army units  from  the  Sixth  U.S.  Army,  the 57lst Medical Company and the  !58th Aviation Battalion of the Army Reserve support› ed fire fighting in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The National Guard  supported  state  fire  fighting  operations  in  those  states  and  in Arizona,  California,  and Utah, with more than 4,200 soldiers engaged in these operations.

Operation GUARDCARE  is  a National Guard pilot program authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 1993 to provide health care to  underserved populations in  the United States. Originally conducted in state active duty status, the program was authorized in federal status in the FY 1994 National Defense Authorization Act.  Under the 1994 guidance, thi1·teen states (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee) have executed missions. Operation GuARDCARE  benefits both soldiers and the civilian communities they assist. Soldiers get training  in military specialties and deployment; communities receive medical screen› ing and limited care for medically underserved citizens. For example,  in five  weekend exercises,  the  Michigan National Guard saw almost 2,500 patients and administered more than 5,600 immunizations.  In  Missouri, the !35th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital conducted a two-week operation in the town ofVan Buren, seeing more than 2,500 patients. The Tennessee National  Guard  screened  more  than  1,400 patients  in six  exercises.  ln Denver,  the 147th  Combat  Support  Hospital  of  the  Colorado  Army National Guard saw 814 patients and gave 623  immunizations in  a two› week exercise.

The reserve  components are playing a  greater  role  in  civil-military outreach programs, many of  them drug-demand reduction programs, such as  Drug Abuse  Resistance  Education  (DARE)  and  Drug Education  for Youth,  aimed  at  youth  at  risk.  The  ARNG  Drug  Demand  Reduction Program  reached  more  than  5,096,610  young  people  throughout  the nation in  FY  1994. Since its  inception, the National  Guard's DARE pro› gram has evolved  into  5,492  programs  nationwide  that  National Guard members support as mentors, tutors, and role models. Each of  these activ› ities  is  a  result  of a  community-based  needs  assessment.  Major Army Reserve commands incorporated the drug-demand reduction message into events  sponsored  by  their  family  support  coordinators.  One  command developed the week-long Camp Wildcat devoted to educating and build› ing the  self-esteem of  the children of  Army Reserve soldiers.  Corporate sponsorship is planned to cover most of the costs for camps in FY  1995. Other commands are planning similar camps of their own.

During FY 1994 the National Guard conducted 6,709 operations and spent more than  1.2 million man-days in support of local, state, and fed› eral law enforcement agencies responsible for counterdrug activities. This support was  provided  over  and  above  normal  training  requirements  by individual National Guard members. The number of man-days was down from FY 1993  due to significant FY 1994 funding reductions levied on the National Guard Counterdrug Support Program.

While  not  considered  to be  a  measme  of effectiveness,  National Guard- assisted drug seizures have increased dramatically over the years.

Although funding reductions had an adverse impact on total man-day lev› els  in  FY  1994,  the  National  Guard's efforts  continued  to  increase  the capabilities of  drug enforcement agencies; and assisted seizures increased in  the  categories  of cash  confiscated,  cocaine  seized,  vehicles  seized, weapons  seized,  and resulting  arrests,  while  they  declined  in  the  cate› gories of  marijuana plants and processed marijuana seized. The estimated street value  of drugs  seized  was  $98  billion.  Data for  FY  1994 assisted seizures is listed in Table  12.

Under provisions  of Section  112, Title  32,  United  States  Code,  the Secretary of Defense is authorized to  grant funds to  state governors for counterdrug  use  by  state  law  enforcement  agencies.  For  FY  1994  the Secretary granted more than $169 million to  Guard units in fifty  states, the  Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico,  Guam,  the Virgin  Islands,  and the District of Columbia to provide that support.

The FY 1994 National Defense Appropriations Act designated $5 million  for  establishment of a  transcription and translation  system to support  the  Drug  Enforcement Administration. The National  Guard was  designated as the action agency for this initiative and responded by establishing a  linguistics support center and providing the required linguists.  Approximately  seventy National  Guard  linguists  supported this  project during the  year. The Army took measures to  procure spe› cialized transcription and translation equipment that will be delivered to  the  National  Guard  to  support  this  mission  during  FY 1995  and beyond.

The states perform counterdrug missions that support the President's Drug Control Strategy and best meet state priorities of the governor and the adjutant general. Table  13 lists the sixteen missions approved for FY 1994.

During FY 1994 twenty-four states conducted more than  1,200 aerial counterdrug reconnaissance and interdiction missions. The ARNG con› ducted many of  these missions at night, utilizing the capabilities of  a spe› cially  designed  OH-58A+  scout  helicopter.  That  aircraft,  an  improved OH- 58A, was modified with an engine upgrade, a thermal imagery sys› tem, a communications package for law enforcement, and enhanced nav› igational  equipment.  The  ARNG  Reconnaissance  and  Interdiction Detachment distribution plan calls for 76 OH- 58A+ aircraft to be located in  31  states and the Western Army Aviation Training Site. By the end of FY 1994,24 states had their allocation of0H- 58A+ aircraft. The final? states  on the  distribution plan are  scheduled to  receive  aircraft  and per› sonnel during FY 1995.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The Army National Guard continued to take advantage of the down› sizing of the active component to receive through transfer much-needed equipment, from radios to  tanks. The redistribution and fielding of  High Mobility  Multipurpose  Wheeled  Vehicles  (HMMWVs)  provided  an opportunity to upgrade fleet CFP units and fill nearly half  of  CFP II units.

The fielding  of new  Heavy Equipment Transporters  (HETs)  began during FY 1994. Twenty-five systems were fielded in FY  1994, and 179 will be fielded during FY 1995. The new HET is rated at 70 tons and can transport M1A1  tanks. Fielding of the Palletized Loading System (PLS)

also began in FY 1994 and will  increase artillery and supply units'  ability to move greater amounts of  ammunition and supplies.

The  ARNG  continued  to  modernize  its  equipment  inventory.  The number of cargo helicopters  increased with the  addition of twenty-three CH-470 helicopters. ARNG units added nine OH- 58C helicopters while turning  in  older  model  OH  6A  observation  helicopters.  Fifteen Kiowa Warrior, OH- 580, helicopters were received in FY 1994. The utility heli› copter fleet was modernized with twenty-one UH- 60A Black Hawk heli› copters. The Army National Guard combat force increased its capabilities with thirty-five MlAl Abrams tanks. The armored personnel carrier fleet was significantly modernized with more than one hundred Ml13A3 car› riers, in  addition to seventy-two  M2/3  Bradley  fighting  vehicles. Signifh:ant quantities  of night  vision  goggles  and  secure  speech  equip› ment were also received.

The ARNG continued  undergoing  several  major equipment conver› sions to maintain compatibility with the active component that will carry into  the next century.  In  FY J 994, M60A3 tanks were converted to Mls, Mll3  armored  personnel  carriers  were  converted  to  Bradley  fighting vehicles, and units converted from the VRC- 12/46 series radios to the new single channel ground and airborne radio system (SINCGARS). The .45caliber pistol was converted to the new 9-mm. Beretta and Ml6Al rifles were  converted  to  M16A2s.  Also,  two  ARNG  field  artillery  battalions converted from MilO howitzers to  the Multiple Launch Rocket System.

The ARNG  continued  supporting  the  upgrade  of equipment during the  fiscal  year. The Guard funded  the  modification of 305  Mll3A2 per› sonnel carriers to the Ml13A3 version to provide an armored personnel carrier capable of operating on the battlefield with the Abrams main bat› tle tank. This program will  continue throughout FY 1995 and beyond as funding allows. Guard funding also included modifying the Fire Support Team Vehicle with an automatic turret-positioning system to give the sys› tem  greater  battlefield  durability.  The  Guard  funded  a  2.5-ton  truck extended  service  program,  which  furnishes  new  clean-burning  engines and new automatic transmissions with transfer cases and central tire infla› tion  systems,  to  improve  the  service  life  of the  aging  cargo  truck fleet through the year 2000. An initiative to extend service life to the bulldozer fleet gathered support within the Guard. All 07F bulldozers will be placed in  an enhancement program, making the "F" model 90  percent compati› ble with the newer "G" model. The latest initiative is the extended service program of  5-ton cargo trucks. This will offer the same enhancements as the 2.5-ton extended service program, with greater hauling capabilities.

The $113.6 million FY  1994 ARNG Depot Level Maintenance Repair and Return Program yielded $71.9 million for overall repair and contrac› tor logistics support of  rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft. The $41.7 million

ground  vehicle  program  returned  inoperable,  high-cost  vehicles  to  the Guard inventory,  offering calibration support for all  specialized items  of equipment for which the Army has no organic repair capability. More than 8,000 pieces of  equipment were returned to operation at a cost of  $33 mil› lion. Two-thirds of  the work was done at Tooele Army Depot; the remain› der of the equipment was  repaired at U.S.  Marine Corps  logistics  bases under a pilot program.

Unfunded depot maintenance requirements have an impact on Army Reserve equipment. Repair requirements and maintenance costs increase if  the equipment is not repaired in a timely manner. Without upgrades, the equipment breaks down more and  becomes less reliable as  it gets older. Because of funding constraints, emphasis is placed on  the "first to fight, first to  be equipped" policy.

The  Army  National  Guard's unfunded  depot  maintenance  require› ments grew from $36 million in  FY  1993  to  $82.5 million  in  FY  1994. These  unfunded  requirements,  affecting  both  equipment and  programs, include  the  extended  service  program  for  5-ton and  1  0-ton  trucks;  the "Inspect and Replace Only as Necessary" program for  the M  1 family of vehicles;  maintenance  of the  M  113  family  of vehicles,  including  the M113Al conversion to the Mll3A3; transfer of  active component HAWK (Homing  All-the-Way  Killer)  air  defense  missile  equipment;  repair  of communications  and  electronics  equipment;  and  overhaul  of UH- 60, AH- 64, CH-47, and CH- 58 aircraft. The effect of the climbing trend of unfunded depot maintenance requirements will have an adverse effect on equipment readiness.

The Army Reserve's unfunded depot maintenance requirements rose dramatically from $1.3 million in  FY 1993 to $52.3 million in FY 1994. This  affects  the  repair  and  return  program,  construction  and  engineer equipment,  communications  and  electronics  equipment,  and  watercraft vehicles.  Increases  in unfunded  requirements in the Army Reserve were due  to  a  mission  transfer  from  the  active  Army  to  the  Army  Reserve (Army watercraft dry-docking mission) and costs associated with the ser› vicewide  medium  tactical  truck  upgrade  initiative.  The increases in unfunded  depot  maintenance  requirements  were  due  to  programmed maintenance scheduling of the Army Reserve's equipment and vehicles.

Emphasis continued to  be placed  upon  improving  the  overall  readi› ness  of  Guard first-to-fight, high  priority, Project Standard Bearer units. The  Guard's Logistics  Directorate  allotted  $1.2  million  from  the  sec› ondary stock fund  to  reduce  mission-essential Equipment Requirements Code shortages in all CFP I and II units.

Army Reserve modernization centers around "core competencies" per› taining  to  combat support  and  combat service  support missions.  In  FY 1994 two  large tugboats were placed  in service, with two  additional tug-

boats scheduled for service in FY 1995. These 128-foot craft are oceango› ing vessels.  Initial quantities of HETs, capable of  carrying the 70-ton Ml Abrams tank,  and the  PLS  were  received  during the  year.  Both  systems provide significant productivity advances. In addition, SINCGARS equip› ment provided early deploying Army Reserve units with fully modern FM radio  communications capabilities. This SINCGARS equipment raised to 50 percent the proportion of Army  Reserve  units  with  modern radios  in 1994. The Army Reserve also had the following major equipment conver› sions: the M113A3 program converted 87 Mll3A2 armored personnel car› riers to  the latest Mll3A3 configuration, and the CH-47D program con› vetted ten CH-47B helicopters to the latest CH-47D configuration.

The percentage of  major equipment on hand rose for the reserve com› ponents in FY  1994. The ARNG  had  98 percent of major equipment on hand,  compared with 90 percent in FY  1993. The USAR had 88 percent of major equipment on hand  in FY  1994, compared with 84 percent the previous  fiscal  year.  During FY  1994, however,  the reserve components experienced some major equipment shortages. (See Table  14.)

Obsolete  and incompatible  equipment  is  maintained  within  the reserve  component  inventory.  Modification  and  conversion  programs

within  the Total Force  continue  to  minimize the  negative  effect  of such equipment on  readiness. The ability of the reserve components to  effec› tively  reinforce the  active Army  upon  mobilization  will  be  directly pro› portional  to  the efforts made  to  continue to modernize weapons systems and equipment assigned to the reserve components. The following obso› lete and incompatible equipment was in reserve component inventories for FY 1994. (See Table  15.)

ARNG combat units have tanks that move at different speeds, usc dif› ferent  ammunition,  and  have  different communications capabilities. The same applies to armored personnel  carriers and other families  of equip› ment. Tactical wheeled vehicle fleets  range from  gasoline-powered vehi› cles more than twenty-five years old to the latest diesel-powered vehicles. Tactical FM radios in different units  include both single-frequency broad› cast models and the latest frequency-hopping,  secure voice SINCGARS radios.

The USAR, which provides combat support and combat service sup› port units and equipment to the Army, has the same problem with tactical wheeled vehicles and  tactical FM  radios as the Army National  Guard. In addition,  both  the M16Al  and M16A2  rifles  still  remained  in  the Army Reserve in FY 1994. These rifles  usc two different sizes of  ammunition, and their parts are not fully compatible.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

After the Persian Gulf  War, Congress charged the DOD to determine strategic mobility requirements in response to  both the changing world environment and a revision of  the national military strategy that calls for fewer forward-deployed forces and more reliance on forces based in the continental  United  States  (CONUS).  The  congressionally  mandated 1992  Mobility  Requirements  Study  concluded  that  the  military  can increase its deployability only through investment in sealift, airlift, pre› positioning, and transportation infrastructure. The study's major recom› mendations  included  buying  up  to  twenty  Large  Medium-Speed  Roll› On/Roll-Off (RO/RO)  ships,  increasing the size of the  Ready  Reserve Force to include thirty-six RO/RO ships, improving airlift with procure› ment of the  C- 17  transport,  placing an Army  armored  brigade  afloat, and  making  numerous  improvements  in  the  CONUS  strategic  infra› structure.

In  FY  1994  the  Army  established  an  interim Army  Pre-positioned Afloat (APA)  package  to  respond  to  major regional  contingencies. The package consisted of an armor brigade set of equipment with doctrinal field  artillery,  combat  engineer,  air  defense  artillery,  chemical,  signal, logistics,  and  military  intelligence  support.  Corpsand  division-level combat support and combat service support units  and  15  days of supply were also pre-positioned. The interim APA package had 12 ships: 7 Ready Reserve Force RO/RO ships with unit equipment; 3 Lighter Aboard Ships with  a  portion  of the  contingency  corps' supplies;  1 T-class  Auxiliary Crane  Ship;  and  1  Heavy  Lift Pre-position Ship  for  port opening. Two leased container ships were  scheduled  to  be operational  in  FY  1995  to complete the contingency corps' thirty-day supply package.

The  Army  also  purchased  187  railcars  for  pre-positioning  at  key installations for rapid deployment and at select depots for basic load and early ammunition sustainment requirements. Half  of  the railcars measured 89  feet  in  length  and  are  designed  to  hold up  to  four  standard overseas

shipment  containers.  The  other  half  were  extra-wide  68-foot  railcars designed  to  hold  oversize  equipment  or  one  MlAI  Abrams  tank.  The Army plans to buy a total of  ,630 railcars by FY 2001. L

## Maintenance

Depot maintenance is  important to sustain the force because it is the only  source of fully  reconditioned  and  overhauled  weapon  systems and equipment for replenishment or redistribution to fill  the equipment readi› ness  needs  of deployable Army  units.  In FY  1994 Army  depot mainte› nance faced  the  challenges of providing the needs  of a downsized  force with  reduced funding  and  a  requirement to  sustain an  adequate organic depot  infrastructure to  meet wartime  needs. The Army's participation in the Joint Cross Service Group for Depot Maintenance (JCSG-DM) helped formulate depot maintenance policies during the analysis process for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)  1995. The JCSG-DM was one of six Joint Cross Service Groups created by the Deputy Secretary of  Defense to work with the military departments and the defense agencies in areas with significant  potential  for  cross-service  impacts  in  BRAC  1995  and  to enhance  opportunities  for  consideration  of cross-service  tradc-offs  and multiservice use of  remaining infrastructure. The JCSG-DM was to deter› mine the common-support depot maintenance fw1ctions  and to  establish guidelines, standards, assumptions, measures of  merit, data clements, and milestone  schedules for  the  DOD  components  to  conduct cross-service analyses of those common support functions.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) defined core require› ments as "the capability maintained within organic defense depots to meet readiness and sustainability requirements of  the weapon systems that sup› port the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  contingency scenario(s). Core depot mainte› nance will comprise only the minimum facilities, equipment, and skilled personnel necessary to  ensure a ready and controlled source of required technical competence." The OSD-approved methodology for determining core requirements resulted in an  Army  calculation of 14.6 million direct labor  hours  allocated among  sixty-three  weapon  systems.  This  core requirement formed the basis for the BRAC 1995 analysis.

The Army  participated in a Defense Science Board Depot Maintenance Task Force, composed of  both government and industry rep› resentatives,  which studied how the depot maintenance workload should be allocated among the public and private sectors. The Task Force recom› mendations  included replacing  the  "60/40" policy  and  other legislative restrictions  with a concept consistent with the core requirements policy; eliminating  public-to-private  and  public-to-public  competitions;  sizing organic depot maintenance capacity to the core requirements; and assign-

ing selected noncore workload to the private sector, which would support the maintenance of  its industrial  base capabilities.

## Sustainability

In  FY  1994  the Army began  implementing a conversion  from  JP-4 aviation fuel to the safer JP- 8 fuel  in  CONUS. All overseas unified com› mands had previously converted or were in the process of  converting to a single fuel  suitable for both aviation and ground equipment. The FY 1994 CONUS conversion started on the West Coast in October 1993, followed by  the Gulf  and  East Coast regions  in  April  1994.  Conversions  for  the remainder of the country were scheduled to  continue through FY 1995 and FY 1996.

The Clean Air Act, which followed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  regulatory  guidance,  went  into  effect  on  1  October  1994,  and it required 0.05  percent low-sulfur fuel  in diesel engines for  highway  use. The Army wanted  to  use  JP- 8  fuel  in CONUS  to  improve  deployment readiness.  Using JP- 8  reduces  the  filter  clogging  that  combat vehicles experienced in transitions from diesel fuel to JP- 8 before overseas deploy› ments or upon arrival overseas. With a sulfur content of  0.3 percent, how› ever, JP- 8 fuel did not meet the EPA specification limit.

In  FY 1994, at the Army's request,  the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) awarded contracts for provision of  nonspecification 0.05 percent low-sulfur JP-8 fuel  to  major deployment installations. Later-deploying units remained on low-sulfur diesel fuel  (LSDF). Since the availability of nonspecification  low-sulfuJ  JP- 8  fuel  presented  supply  difficulties,  the Tank-Automotive Command (TACOM) Mobility Technical Center began testing emissions from standard JP- 8 fuel, which was  inherently "clean› er" than LSDF. These tests concluded in FY 1994 that standard JP- 8 fuel emissions were equal to or less than  the  emissions standards  set by  the EPA for LSDF. Based on test results  that revealed military specification JP- 8  fuel  met the  standards  of the Clean Air Act,  the DOD planned to request  a  blanket EPA  exemption  to  use  standard  JP- 8  fuel  instead  of LSDF or low-sulfur JP- 8 fuel.

During FY 1994 the Army also prepared to adopt a revised bulk petro› leum management policy. The new policy resulted from a DOD expansion of the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) bulk petroleum responsibilities in  1992. The DOD directed the  military services to  consolidate their pri› mary bulk petroleum storage but allow them to continue at their option to exercise  operational  control  at  their  respective  installations.  Under this policy change the DLA would assume ownership of fuel  in Army inter› mediate jet fuel storage sites  in  CONUS and selected sites  in Korea and Germany, plus USAREUR war reserve stocks. Implementation of policy

changes addressing subsequent consolidation  of installation storage sys› tems was scheduled to begin in October 1993. In FY 1994, however, con› solidation was officially delayed until October 1997 to allow for develop› ment of a new Fuels Automation Management System to replace the cur› rent Defense Fuel Automated Management System.

Under  the  planned  management  consolidation  policy  changes,  all Army fuel storage facilities that receive fuel through post, camp, and sta› tion contracts and serve more than one customer will be capitalized to the DLA. Once the facilities are capitalized, the DLA will  assume the fund› ing responsibility  for  maintenance and repair,  military construction  for the storage sites, and funding for all  associated environmental costs that occur after capitalization.  Environmental  costs include funding  of state and federal operating permits and cleanup of spills and leaks that occur after capitalization.

With  the  announced  delay  of capitalization  in  FY  1994,  the  Army requested  that  the  DFSC assume  the  funding  responsibility  for  mainte› nance  and  repair,  military  construction,  and  environmental  permits,  as well as other environmental costs for installations that will be capitalized in FY 1997. The DFSC agreed in FY 1994 to begin funding these require› ments on 1 October 1995.

In FY 1994 the AI  my carried out the first operational deployment of Force Provider, a tent-based system that contains all of  the materiel nec› essary to provide high-quality food, billeting, laundry, personal hygiene, and morale, welfare, and recreation to a battalion-size force. The system began development in 1991, after the CSA identified quality of life as a crucial  element  in  improving  overall  combat  readiness.  Its  modulai design allows  each module,  which  supports  550 soldiers,  to  be joined with other system modules to support a force from battalion to brigade size or larger. It gives the frontline soldier a brief  respite from the rigors of the combat theater.  In addition to  increasing the capability for force projection,  it  also  increases  the  capability  for  theater  reception  and reconstitution  missions,  humanitarian  assistance,  and disaster  relief operations.

The Combat and  Materiel  Developers' program  for  Force  Provider identified DOD inventory and nondcvelopmental items, which were inte› grated into a field-tested prototype module. Limited procurement of  Force Provider began in FY 1993, followed  by the completion of  an operational test  in  November  1993.  Following  the  demonstration  and  evaluation  of one module by the XVIII Airborne Corps in November, the corps received the module for training and to enhance its early force-projection capabil› ity. This  module  was  deployed  in  support  of Task  Force 160  at Guantanamo,  Cuba,  in  FY  1994  to  support  U.S. personnel in the Caribbean during Haitian refugee interception operations.

Force Provider will be operated by a Quartermaster Type B cadre unit (equivalent  to  approximately  44  supervisory  personnel)  augmented  by contractor, host~nation, or borrowed military manpower, or a combination thereof. One Force Provider unit can operate up to six modules (a brigade~ size force). The 488th Quartermaster Company was activated in FY 1994 at fort Bragg to operate Force Provider.

In late FY  1992 the Army had initiated the building of  twelve interim modules, primarily from existing Army inventory. In FY 1994 six of  these modules, comprising Interim Support Package No. 1, were completed and loaded  on the Army pre~position ship Gopher State. Six  more modules, making up Interim Support Package No. 2, were completed and placed in storage at Sierra Army Depot. The support equipment necessary to set up force Provider was assembled and  loaded on the Army pre~position ship Cape Wrath. The Army plans to procure up to 36 Force Provider modules, with  24 modules to be stored  in  U.S.  depots  and  the remaining  12 pre~ positioned afloat.

## Security Assistance

Security assistance is an  important element in national security. Army security assistance goals vary from  region to  region.  In  Asia,  the objec› tives arc to  expand U.S.  influence, increase access to key locations, mod› ernize equipment and force structure, and create a climate of  trust and sta› bility.  ln the  Middle  East (including  Greece),  the Army  assists  friendly states  by  providing military equipment and training for their own securi› ty, preventing  coercion  of these  states,  and  preserving  U.S.  access.  In Europe, Army security assistance is undergoing a major effort to modern› ize and standardize equipment and doctrine among North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies.  ln Latin America (including the Caribbe· an) and Africa, security assistance helps developing countries to upgrade and professionalize  their  ground  forces  and  teaches  respect  for  human  and civil  rights.

ln FY 1994 security assistance support in Asia went to Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea,  and Thailand  through the Foreign Military  Sales (FMS) program. Taiwan received DOD approval to purchase the Avenger Pedcs!al~Mounted Stinger  System  antiaircraft  missile, the Chaparral MIM- 72J  missile,  and  the  Armored  Gun  System  (AGS).  Taiwan  took delivery of  sixteen of  twenty-six Oll- 58D armed scout helicopters that it had already purchased. Taiwan also signed a commercial contract with the Raytheon Company for the Modified Air Defense System. An amendment to  Japan's Black Hawk/Sea Hawk memorandum of understanding autho~ rizcd  production  of additional  {fll- 60  helicopters  in  Japan.  Intensive negotiations continued on a possible upgrading of  the l05~mm. main tank

gun on the Republic of  Korea Indigenous Tank to 120-mm. This tank was developed with U.S. assistance and utilizes substantial Ml and M60 tech› nology.  Korea  also  concluded  a  coproduction  agreement  to  produce M109A2 self-propelled howitzers. Thailand purchased  125  M60A3TTS tanks and received a waiver of restrictions on the  release  of  AN/AVS- 6 third-generation night-vision  goggles  to support  Thailand's  fleet of Iroquois and Cobra helicopters. .

Security  assistance  in the  Middle East  (including  Greece)  went  to Israel, Greece,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Kuwait,  Bahrain,  Qatar,  the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian National Authority. Israel purchased six MLRS's with a minimal support package for  delivery in December 1994. The launchers and some other items were diverted from Army production and depot stock to  meet the delivery schedule. Greece purchased  18 MLRS  's with support items and services. Nine were from assets initially produced for Saudi Arabia and the other nine were from new production. Deliveries were scheduled for 1995.  Lebanon  purchased  175  excess  Ml13A2  Armored  Personnel Carriers, the first installment toward a fleet of  675. This purchase was the first major  one  by  Lebanon since the  security  assistance  program was reinstated as part of  the peace process for that country. The FMS program for the Saudi Ministry of  Defense and Aviation was restricted by contin› uing Saudi cash flow problems during FY 1994. No new weapon systems sales were initiated. The Saudis canceled their MLRS program. The U.S. government found another FMS customer to take over the program with a  resultant  saving  to  Saudi  Arabia  of $50  million.  The  Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) FMS program was not restricted by cash flow problems. Delivery of Light Armor Vehicles (LAYs)  to  the SANG con› tinued on schedule. The SANG received more than 300 LAYs during FY 1994.  Significant FMS  activities  for  Kuwait  included  the  Presidential Determination of July  1994 that approved the release of depleted urani› um  120-mm. tank  ammunition  to  Kuwait.  The  approval  resulted in  an FMS  for  tank  ammunition  valued  at  $25.9  million.  The  first  of 218 MlA2  Abrams  tanks  destined  for  Kuwait  under  the  FMS  program received an acceptance ceremony at the Lima, Ohio, tank plant in August 1994.  The  remaining  tanks are  scheduled  for production  through December 1995. Bahrain's first Excess Defense Articles (EDA) acquisi› tion  under section 516  of the Foreign Assistance Act was  approved  in April  1994.  Six  AH- lP  Cobra  training  helicopters  were  provided  as EDA. A Presidential Determination issued in July  1994 authorized the sale of 1  05-mm. M833 depleted uranium tank ammunition to Bahrain for use  with its M60A3  tanks.  In  April  the  first U.S.-Qatar  Military Consultative Committee was held  in Washington, D.C.  Qatar purchased only training but established a foundation for future  FMS program pur-

chases of  weapons and materiel. The UAE continued to request a variety ofFMS logistics support and services for two major systems, the HAWK air  defense  system  and  the  AH-64A Apache  attack helicopter.  Oman completed its Tube-launched,  Optically Tracked, Wire Command-Link Guided (TOW) missile upgrade program.  Oman also received computer equipment  for  a  training  center  and  language  laboratory.  The  Oman Royal Guard  acquired  M 16A2  rifles from  the  Special Defense Acquisition Fund, but the U.S. Army  lost a potential $4 million sale of M16A2 rifles when the assets were diverted to Kuwait during Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR.  Egypt received its final installment of the AH-64A Apache attack helicopter program with receipt of 24 aircraft and signed a letter of  agreement for an additional 12 aircraft to  be delivered in 1997. Egypt also  purchased  340 M60A3  tanks  equipped with  thermal sights and 78  Mll3A2 armored personnel carriers, in addition to quantities of M35A2 trucks, M85 machine guns, M239 grenade launchers, and M815 cannon  tubes  under  the  Southern  Region  Amendment  to  the  Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). FMS to Jordan included 30 Cobra helicopters, 18 UH- lH helicopters, and various antiaircraft systems. Jordan also negoti› ated with  the  United  States  for  the  purchase  of six  Black Hawk heli› copters. The exercise of  presidential drawdown authority under the FAA provided the Palestinian National Authority with 150 Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicles (CUCVs) and 50 M35A2 trucks.

In Africa, the Department of State provided the DOD with $5.5 mil› lion  in  peacekeeping funds  to purchase 28 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles,  16  five-ton  trucks,  and  other  equipment  to  support peacekeeping units from the Economic Community ofWest African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring  Group in Liberia. Materiel  was delivered  to Liberia  in  September 1994  for  use  by  units  from  Ghana  and Tanzania. These countries in turn will retain the materiel upon completion of  their assignments in Liberia.

Security assistance in Europe went to Germany, Switzerland, France, the  UN,  and  NATO.  In August  1994  the  Defense  Security  Assistance Agency gave the Army approval to conclude a memorandum of  agreement that permits Germany to acquire and coproduce Air-to-Air Stinger missile subsystem  components.  The  Army also received  agreements  with Germany  and  with  Switzerland  to  negotiate  the  release  of the  Stinger. France  executed  an  eleven-month  lease  in  December  1993  for  seven GroundNehlcular Laser Locator designators with ground support equip› ment and a logistics support package for use in operations in Bosnia. The UN leased  ANffPQ- 36 and  ANffPQ- 37  Firefinder  Radars  for  use  in Bosnia  by  Jordanian  forces.  Finally,  the U.S. Army  concluded a  copro› duction  agreement  with  NATO for the HAWK  air  defense  system European Limited Improvement Program.

In Latin America (including the Caribbean), security assistance went to  Argentina, Colombia,  Bolivia,  Jamaica,  Ecuador, Guyana, the Dominican Republic,  Mexico,  Haiti,  and  the  seven  Eastern  Caribbean island  nations  of Antigua-Barbuda,  Barbados,  Dominica,  Grenada,  St. Christopher-Nevis,  St.  Lucia,  and  St.  Vincent  and  the  Grenadines. As Argentina continued to upgrade its existing military assets in FY 1994, the U.S. Army transferred 10 OV- ID Mohawk aircraft and support equipment to Argentina under the FAA. The Argentine Army also acquired approxi› mately $2 million in spare and repair parts for its fleet ofM113 armored personnel  carriers.  Colombia received  $7.7  million  in  Foreign  Military Financing (FMF) grant monies. Bolivia received $2.967  million for use exclusively in the counterdrug war. Jamaica received up to $1.5 million in DOD  assistance  under  FAA  presidential  drawdown  authority.  Jamaica received five  inflatable  boats  to  assist  in securing  Kingston Harbor and processing  Haitian  migrants.  Jamaica  also  received  $300,000  in  FMF funding,  primarily  to  improve  the  drug  interdiction  capabilities  of the Jamaican Defense Forces. In February 1994 the U.S. Army completed the transfer of  $2 million in disaster relief  to Ecuador under FAA presidential drawdown  authority.  The  U.S. Army  Security  Assistance  Command (USASAC) transferred six excess Bailey bridges from U.S. Army assets in Europe, and a three-man mobile training team supervised the installation. Ecuador also received $130,000 in FMF, exclusively to support its coun› terdrug efforts.  Guyana received $180,000 in FMF to  assist in  the devel› opment of a counterdrug capability. The President authorized a $12 mil› lion  drawdown under the  FAA for  the Dominican Republic  to  assist in sealing its border with Haiti. The U.S. Army transferred an estimated $10 million in materiel, including six UH- 1 helicopters, fifty CUCVs, radios, and  troop  support  equipment.  The  Dominican  Republic  also  received $300,000 in FMF grant monies, primarily to support U.S. and UN efforts to topple the former military jt.mta in Haiti. In response to  a native upris› ing in the Chiapas region of Mexico, Army Security Assistance provided the  Mexican Army  with 55,000  Meals, Ready to  Eat (MRE), rations to feed  national  military  forces  in  that  region.  USASAC  also  provided Mexico with fifty AN/PVS- 7 third-generation ground night-vision gog› gles.  The  seven island  Eastern  Caribbean  nations  of Antigua-Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Christopher- Nevis, St.  Lucia, and St. Vincent  and  the  Grenadines  received  a  total  of $390,000  FMF  grant monies to encourage the expansion of  the seven-nation Regional Security System  which,  among  other  things,  promotes  cow1terinsurgency  and antidrug efforts.

Army Security Assistance training varies from year to  year, depend› ing upon the amount of  equipment sold under the FMS program. Another variant  is  the  money  appropriated  for  training  under  the  International

Military Education and Training (IMET) Program. In FY 1994 the Army trained 5,825 FMS students,  its  largest number to  date,  at a cost of $76 million.  The  Army  deployed ninety-eight  new teams  from outside CONUS, with a total of  379 personnel, to  twenty-five different countries. These teams  supported equipment sales,  installation,  maintenance,  and some training. The IMET approptiation for FY  1994 was $21.1  million. Of that amount,  113  countries spent $9 million on Army training. A total of 1,383 TMET international students were trained during this period. The large training load  in  FMS  was due to the sale of the HAWK air defense system to  the UAE, AH- 60 Apache attack helicopters  to Egypt and the UAE, and the MiA I tank to  Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

Army security assistance faced two major challenges in FY 1994. The first was the provision of  materiel and training in support of  peacekeeping and  humanitarian  operations.  The  Army  provided  peacekeeping  and humanitarian assistance either  unilaterally or through  the  UN  to  twelve countries.  This  assistance  consisted  mostly  of materiel  such as  tactical wheeled  vehicles,  bridges,  trailers,  radars,  armored  personnel  carriers, helicopters, tanks, radios, support and  individual equipment, spare parts, and rations, all  valued  at a  total  of approximately  $500 million.  While some of  these costs were reimbursable to the Army, others, such as grants, were  not.  The Army  used  its  own  funds  to  transport  items  transferred under grant to their final destination. The other significant challenge was that  the  number  of foreign  students  from  the  former  Warsaw  Pact and Soviet Union attending Army schools continued to increase dramatically. The program expanded from three nations in 1991  to  twenty-four coun› tries  in 1994. The Army allocated almost 20 percent of the funds appro› priated for  the lnternational Military Education and Training program to former Soviet republics and countries in Eastern Europe such as Albania, Ukraine, Russia,  Kazakhstan,  Poland,  and  Estonia. Total Army  security assistance sales of equipment, training, and other support services for FY 1994 amounted to $2 billion.

During FY 1994 the U.S. Army participated in the XXI Conference of American Armies (CAA). The Army's participation in the CAA since its formation  in 1960 reflects the service's support for U.S.  national interests in the area. The CAA is a biennial forum  for Western Hemisphere armies designed  to promote  cohesion, improve  hemispheric  security,  and strengthen inter-American military-to-military relations. The CAA com› prises  seven  specialized  conferences,  a  Preparatory  Conference,  and  a Commanders'  Conference held in a member army's  country during a two› year  period.  The  seven  specialized  conferences  are  Civil  Affairs  and Psychological  Operations;  Logistics;  Training  and  Military  Education; Science, Technology, and Medicine;  Communications;  Intelligence;  and Military Law Symposium.

The Army Staff's participation in the  CAA reflects support for U.S. policy and defense interests in the region, including a commitment to fos› tering  democracy,  development,  and  dialogue  with  our southern neigh› bors. The U.S. Army also seeks to promote improved cooperative defense within  the  context  of greater  respect  for  democracy  and  human  rights among the militaries in the region, as weJI as improved civil-military rela› tions. The Chief  of  Staff, Army, determined that the CAA is a key priori› ty program to support attainment of  regional U.S.  policies on an army-to› army basis.

Argentina hosted  the  XXI CAA during FY 1994. There are sixteen permanent  member  states  of  the  CAA:  Argentina,  Bolivia,  Brazil, Canada,  Chile, Colombia,  the  Dominican  Republic,  Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Peru, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Observer armies and international organizations in good standing are Antigua-Barbuda; Barbados; Costa Rica; Jamaica; Mexico; Trinidad and  Tobago; the Inter-American Defense Board; and COPECODECA, the Permanent Council for the Cooperative Defense of Central America,  composed of El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  and HondW'as. Haiti  and Panama were inactive observers  in FY 1994. The  XXI CAA specialized  conferences  conducted  in  FY  1994  were:  IV  Civil  Affairs, 9- 13  May,  in  Guatemala City,  Guatemala;  and II  Logistics,  31 July- 5 August, in Brasilia, Brazil.

The U.S.  Army also  participated  in  Defense Analysis  Seminar VIII during the fiscal year. The Defense Analysis Seminar began in  1981  and has  been held  at  two-year  intervals.  It is  held  at the  Korea  Institute  for Defense  Analyses  in  Seoul  and  is  cosponsored  by  the  Deputy  Under Secretary  of the  Army  (Operations  Research)  (DUSA  [OR])  and  the President of  the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. The purpose of  the seminar is to foster international discussions on analysis pertinent to cur› rent  Republic  of Korea- United  States  issues.  Emphasis  is  placed  on improving analytic methodologies and presenting specific study results. It gives the United States and the Republic of  Korea an opportunity to share research, analysis, and techniques of  conunon interest within the defense programs of  the countries. Presentations for the Defense Analysis Seminar are  competitively selected by  the  DUSA  (OR)  and  the President of the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses.

The theme of the Defense Analysis Seminar VIII, Designing, Sizing, and Controlling the Force, was  most timely.  U.S. and Republic of Korea forces were undergoing great changes, with the U.S. force transforming to Force XXI. The scientific  and  analytical communities  never  before  had the opportunities or challenges presented by this age of shared data, uni› versal  databases,  real-time  reporting,  and instantaneous radio communi› cations and intelligence.

## Research, Development, Test,  and Evaluation (RDTE)

RDTE is  critical  to  the  support of Army  modernization  programs. Table 16 shows budget figures representing the procurement of  end items, RDTE,  and  FY  1994  Total  Obligation  Authority  (TOA)  in  the  FY 1994-1999 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), which was formu› lated  in  June  1992;  the  PY  1994-1995  Budget  Estimate  Submission (BES), which was prepared in September 1992; and the FY 1994-1995 Presidential Budget (PRESBUD) request, finalized in February 1993:

The Army's Chemical  and  Biological  Defense Technology Program plays  a  prominent  role  in  research  and  development.  In  FY  1994  the Chemical and Biological Defense Technology Program had eight notable accomplishments. First, the program successfully installed and operated a  frequency-agile  laser  in  a  cooperative  international  effort  with  the French government. The laser's capabilities included detection, identifi› cation, and  mapping of chemical agent vapors, aerosols, and liquids on the  ground  at  distances  up  to  three  kilometers.  Second,  the  program demonstrated a pressure swing absorption filtration  system that offered the potential to reduce significantly or eliminate the need for NBC filter replacement.  Third,  the  Light  Vehicle  Obscuration  Screening  System (LVOSS)  moved  ahead  to  the  concept  demonstration  and  validation phase.  LVOSS,  which  dispenses smoke to  the  front  and rear of a  light vehicle  to  obscure the vehicle,  uses nonfragmenting grenades and envi› ronmentally safe materials. LVOSS emphasizes the protection of antiar› mor vehicles from  visual  threats.  Fourth, the  program demonstrated an electrospray  ionization  mass  spectrometry  technique  for  biomolecule analysis through identification of  phospholipids.  This  technique is applicable to the mass spectrometric detection and identification of bio› logical agents. Fifth, the program completed the purification of  the most highly  reactive,  broad-spectrum organophosphorus anhydrolase yet dis› covered. The gene coding for the production of  the enzyme was success› fully cloned into E.  coli  and demonstrated that l gram of  the recombinant

cells  can  degrade  0.8  gram  molecules  of organophosphorus  agent  per minute.  Sixth, the program demonstrated a previously unknown mecha› nism for  the  destruction of the  highly toxic  nerve  agent VX  (0- ethyl, S- 2- diisopropylaminoethyl  methylphosphonothiolate  ).  This  discovery opened the way for one of the most successful alternatives to the incin› eration of the U.S. VX stockpile. Seventh, the program devised a special marking round that allowed terrain designation for forward air controllers to  coordinate  close  air support and  minimize  fratricide  during  combat operations. Eighth, the program demonstrated a unique fiber optic probe and Raman spectrometer that could be used to identify nonintrusively the contents  of  vials  from obsolete  Chemical  Agent  Identification  Sets before demilitarization and disposal.

The  Army's  Science  and  Technology  Base  underwent  significant restructuring  during  the  fiscal year  after  implementing  1991  and  1993 BRAC Commission recommendations. BRAC 1991 recommendations led to  the establishment of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The ARL evolved from the Army Materiel Command's Laboratory Command and elements of  the Army Research Institute; Belvoir Research, Development, and  Engineering  Center;  Center  for  Night  Vision  and  Electro-Optics; Tank-Automotive  Command;  Chemical  Research,  Development,  and Engineering Center; and the Army Institute for Research in Management Information, Communications,  and Computer Sciences. Also  as  part of BRAC 1991, the Medical Research and Materiel Command reduced the number of  medical research laboratories from nine to six. In addition, the Command relocated seven medical programs among existing Army, Navy, and Air Force medical laboratories. BRAC 1993 recommendations dises› tablished the Belvoir Research, Development, and Engineering Center and closed the Vint Hill Farms Station.

The Army's  ballistic missile defense program made moderate progress in FY 1994. In FY 1993 theAlmy had convened a Senior Review Council (SRC) composed of  general offl.cers and civilians representing the Army and  the  Ballistic Missile  Defense  Office. The  council's mission was  to assess and ultimately recommend which two missiles should be incorpo› rated into  the Patriot system to provide effective defense against theater ballistic missiles.  The council met quarterly for more than a year. Its delib› erations were supported by a technical missile review board that analyzed test results  and conducted almost one million detailed computer simula› tions  of the  performance  of the  candidate missiles  in  defeating a  wide variety  of theater  ballistic  and cruise missile  attacks.  The Training and Doctrine Command also conducted a cost and operational analysis, based in part on the same simulations.

Early in 1994 the findings of  the SRC were reported to the Army lead› ership and then to the Office of  the Secretary ofDefense (OSD). The OSD

directed  a panel of experts drawn from non-Army sources to review the selection  process  and  its  results.  The panel judged  the  process  and the results appropriate and the OSD accepted these findings. In June 1994 the OSD Defense Resources Board approved the Patriot program at a Defense Acquisition Board meeting.

The Army's weapon systems modernization strategy in FY 1994 con› tinued to be guided by a post- Cold War environment defined by new glob› al challenges and fiscal constraints. The service adhered to a strategy of buying a limited number of  new weapons, such as the RAH- 66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter and the Advanced Field Artillery System and  Future  Armored  Resupply  Vehicle,  while  extending  the  lives  and improving the capabilities of  existing systems. This strategy allowed man› agement of scarce modernization resources by  limiting large  investment and  inserting  information  technologies, using  Horizontal  Technology Integration (HTI)  and Vertical Technology Integration (VTI),  to  signifi› cantly increase the capabilities and utilization of  proven weapons. HTI is the strategy of  applying enabling command, control, and communications technologies  throughout multiple  systems to  improve warfighting capa› bilities. The  Army's major HTI effort in FY 1994 involved the application of digital teclmologies to a heavy task force that was digitally linked to a brigade in the Advanced Warfighting Experiment, DESERT HAMMER VI, at the National Training Center. VTI is the application of an enabling tech› nology within a system to upgrade operational capability, to reduce cost, or  to  improve  its  warfighting  capability.  For example,  in  FY  1994  the Patriot Advanced  Capability  III  program  highlighted  an  ongoing VTI effort  to  enhance  the  operational  capabilities  of the  Patriot air defense artillery  missile  system  with  modifications  that  included  an  improved missile and radar. Despite the success of  these upgrading efforts, the Army recognizes  that there  is  a  point beyond  which  additional  technological insertions to existing systems will provide only marginal improvements to capabilities.

FY 1994 proved to be a critical year in the development of  the Army's deep attack capability. Deep attack weapon systems provide the Army an advanced,  nonnuclear  family  of long-range  field  artillery  missiles  and munitions to attack a varied array of fixed and mobile, hard and soft tar› gets. In FY 1993 the Army's  deep attack capability depended on the field› ed Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Block I missile and contin› ued development of the Army variant of the Tri-Service Standoff  Attack Missile (TSSAM). TSSAM was a joint Army, Navy,  and Air Force pro› gram. The program objective was to develop a family of  affordable, high› ly survivable, conventional, stealthy cruise missiles that would satisfy tri› service requirements to effectively engage a variety of  high-value land and sea targets. The Army variant was  to  carry the BAT  brilliant antiarmor

104

submunition, a dual-sensor (acoustic and  infrared) smart submunition, to be  launched from the MLRS M270 Launcher. In  FY  1994 the Army ter› minated the TSSAM program after assessing it to be a high risk.  In addi› tion to a long history of  technical problems, engineering and manufactur› ing  development (EMD) costs doubled,  production unit cost projections tripled, and the initial fielding date continually slipped.

When the termination of  TSSAM left the Army with no deep attack carrier  for  the  BAT  submunition,  the  Army  chose  a  variant  of the ATACMS Block I missile, the Block II missile, as the service's new BAT carrier. The Army considered the integration of the BAT into  the proven ATACMS system to  be the lowest risk approach to provide the service a deep attack capability. ATACMS Block II missiles would incorporate thir› teen BAT submunitions out to a range of 124 kilometers to attack specif› ic armored, mobile combat vehicles.

The ATACMS Block IIA  missile,  an extended-range version  of the Block II missile, will carry a preplanned improvement BAT submunition out  to  a  range  of 248  kilometers.  The  Army  initiated  the  preplanned improvement BAT program in FY 1994. The Army also stretched the BAT EMD from a 54-month effort to a 79-month effort scheduled for comple› tion in FY  1998 to realign it with the Block II ATACMS program.

The Joint Precision  Strike  Demonstration  (JPSD)  conducted  a  sur› face-to-surface  ATACMS  weapons  demonstration  in  FY  1994  that fur› thered  the Army's goal  of achieving  a  deep  attack capability.  Since  its organization in  1992,  the  JPSD's mission  has  focused  on improving the joint force commander's  capability to conduct precision strike operations. The goal of the JPSD to develop an adverse weather,  day and night, sen› sor-to-shooter  deep  fire  precision  strike  capability  against  high-value mobile targets at extended range continued in FY 1994. JPSD continued conducting demonstrations highlighting technical capabilities and opera› tional concepts to solve precision strike problems.

The 1994 demonstration highlighted the U.S. Army's Extended Range Army Tactical Missile System (ER ATACMS) Block IA and IIA missiles. Block lA missiles are  used  to  attack tactical surface-to-surface  missile sites, air defense systems, logistics elements, and command, control, and communications complexes.  Block IIA missiles  are  being developed to auack mobile targets such as surface-to-surface missile launchers in pre› cision strike missions against time-critical deep targets. All ER ATACMS activities  tlu·oughout the  United  States  were  controlled  and  monitored from JPSD's  Integration  and Evaluation  Center  at  the  U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

Meanwhile,  production  and development  continued  on basic ATACMS,  with  its  antipersonnel  and  antimateriel  warhead.  ATACMS Block I entered its fourth year offull-rate production with procurement of

255 missiles. The ATACMS Block lA entered its first year of  a 36-month EMD. The ATACMS Block IIA is planned to enter EMD during 1998 and begin production in 2002.

Other significant developments in field artillery systems in FY  1994 included the test firings of  an MLRS rocket and an ATACMS rocket from the Iligh Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and the develop› ment  of  the Sense  and  Destroy  Armor  (SADARM)  submunition. IIIMARS,  a  development  of the  MLRS  family,  mounts  a  six-rocket MLRS launcher on a medium tactical vehicle five-ton truck and has the same fire control, electronics, and communications systems as the M270 MLRS launcher. It is transportable by C- 130 aircraft to areas inaccessible to C- 5 and C- 141  transports, which carry the M270 launcher. SADARM is a fire-and-forget submunition that is delivered to the target area by 155mm.  artillery  projectiles  or  the  MLRS  and  is  designed  to  detect  and destroy  armored  vehicles,  primarily  self-propelled  artillery.  SADARM entered EMD in March 1988. In April 1994 performance testing of 155mm. SADARM  projectiles  exceeded  performance  requirements  and enabled SADARM entry into low-rate production.

The Army received six prototype XM8 Armored Gun System (AGS) vehicles in FY 1994 from a contractor for technical and early user testing. The  AGS  is  viewed  as  a  replacement  for  the  Vietnam-era  M551Al Sheridan armored assault vehicle. The AGS is equipped with a 1  05-mm. main gun, manned by a crew of  three, and designed for rapid strategic and tactical deployment. Its design also permits rapid installation of tWo addi› tional versions of  add-on, modular armor protection that allow deploying units  to  tailor the AGS  to meet expected  threats. The AGS  base version weighs 19.5 tons. The level-two combat-loaded weight version is just over 23 tons, and the level-three combat-loaded weight version about 25.5 tons. The base level and level-twoAGS versions are transportable on C- 130 air› craft. The AGS can also be airdropped by parachute. Extensive AGS test› ing is scheduled to  continue through 1997.

The Army started eight Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) in FY 1994. ATDs facilitate the integration of  proposed technologies into a full  demonstration or engineering and manufacturing development.

The  Composite  Armored  Vehicle  (CAV)  ATD  (1994-1997)  will examine a  lighter weight, more survivable  ground combat vehicle using advanced composite structural materials and advanced lightweight armor. CAY  ATD  plans  envision  using  a  22-ton  weight-class  platform.  The demonstration  is  intended to  emphasize manufacturability,  repairability, nondestructive testing, and structural and ballistic integrity.

The Precision  Guided Mortar Mlmition (PGMM) ATD  will explore two major enhancements for  120-mm. mortars. The PGMM ATD intends to  utilize  fire-and-forget  smart  munitions  in  120-mm.  mortars  and  to

106

extend the mortar's  range from approximately seven kilometers to approx› imately 15 kilometers.

The Enhanced Fiber Optic Guided Missile (EFOGM) ATD is intend› ed  to  demonstrate  improvements  in  the  Fiber  Optic  Guided  Missile System. EFOGM ATD plans anticipate enabling a gunner in defilade to engage  and  defeat  enemy  armored  combat  vehicles,  other  high-value ground targets, and rotary-wing aircraft that may be masked from  line-of› sight weapon systems, day or night, at ranges up to 15 kilometers.

The  Objective  Individual  Combat Weapon  ATD  will  demonstTate technologies for a new small-arms weapon system. The weapon system, a combination rifle and grenade launcher, is intended to yield dramatically improved hit probabilities and terminal effects compared to  the existing grenade launcher and Ml6A2 rifle.

The Hunter Sensor Suite ATD will demonstrate a lightweight, deploy› able, and durable Hunter platform equipped with an advanced long-range sensor suite for early-entry light forces. The suite will combine a second› generation  thermal  imager,  day  television,  an  eyesafe  laser rangefinder and automatic target recognition processor, and a communications system for linkage to a command, contTol, and communications network.

The Generation II Soldier ATD will demonstrate the design utility of a  multicomponent  integrated soldier system. The  system  is  to  be  com› posed of  various devices to improve soldier protection, comfort, and situ› ational awareness.

The  Total  Distribution  ATD  will  demonstrate  through  integrating technologies the means to improve tracldng logistics total asset visibility. Total  Distribution ATD  plans  anticipate  examining  automated  logistics planning tools; computer simulation and modeling techniques; advanced microelectTonics;  satellite  tracking;  and  communication  systems.  The ATD is intended to display requirements and locations of  logistic assets at strategic, operational, and tactical levels.

The Off  Route Smart Mine Clearance ATD will evaluate countermea› sure techniques to neutralize side-attack smart mines situated near roads that  pose  threats  to  combat  and  logistics  vehicles.  The  demonstration intends  to  trigger  a  premature  smart-mine  activation  by  employing  a remote controlled vehicle emulating the acoustic and seismic signatures of a combat vehicle.

The Army completed one ATD, AirLand Battle Management (ALBM), during the fiscal year. The ALBM ATD demonstrated that advanced com› puter planning and battle mo11itoring decision aids reduced operational and tactical planning times to speed up the decision-making process.

In FY 1994 the Army adopted a new DOD acquisition strategy initia› tive, the  Advanced  Concept Technology  DemonstTation  (ACTD).  The ACTD surpasses the ATD in being a more thorough technology demon-

stration and in developing concepts of  operation and doctrine to  optimize a  system's capability.  The  ACTO  enhances  the  acquisition  process  by allowing the Army to better evaluate a technology before conunitting to its acquisition.

The Army approved  three ACTDs  in  FY  1994. The Precision/Rapid Counter  Multiple Rocket Launcher ACTO will examine technologies to defeat North Korean 240-mm. multiple-launch rockets. The Rapid Force Projection Initiative ACTO will demonstrate teclmologies intended to pro› vide early-entry  light forces  greater durability  in  a confrontation with  a heavy force. The Joint Countermine ACTO will integrate Army, Navy, and Marine  Corps  technologies  in  demonstrating  mine-countermine  opera› tions.  Two  Joint  Countermine  ACTO  demonstrations  are  planned,  one focusing on land combat, and one on deep and shallow water mine-coun› termine operations.

The  Army  redesignated  the  Advanced  Concepts  and  Technology (ACT)  Program  as  ACT  I1 during  the  fiscal  year.  Formerly  the  ACT Program provided initial funding for proof-of-principle demonstrations of high-risk and  high-payoff technologies  proposed  by  sources outside  the Army.  Beginning in FY  1994, ACT II  began providing direct support to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's  Battle Lab program and Louisiana Maneuvers Task Force. ACT JI is  intended  to help solve Army problems  by  encouraging the  application  of emerging technologies  that would not ordinarily be supported by the Army because of  risk or lack of funding.

In FY 1994 the  U.S.  Army  Communications-Electronics  Command (CECOM) let a $72.2 million, 48-month  contract to  develop  the second generation  Forward Looking  Infrared (FLIR)  Horizontal  Technology Integration program. The Army intends to integrate the second generation FLIR  into  the  M2A2  Bradley  Commander's Independent  Viewer,  the M2A3  Improved  Bradley  Acquisition  Subsystem,  the  M1A2  Abrams Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer and  Gunner's Primary Sight Thermal  Imaging  System,  the  M8  Armored  Gun  System  Gunner's Primary Sighting  System and Thermal Imaging System,  and  the  Long› Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System.

CECOM  also  Jet  a  $20  million  contract  to  develop  a  system  to enable the Army's light forces to detect and locate targets from beyond the effective range of enemy direct-fire weapons.  Under the 48-month Hunter Sensor Suite Program, the contractor is to develop a technology demonstration system and integrate it in the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle. The project is part of the Army's rapid force projection program. The sensor system is to include a second gen› eration FLIR sensor, an eyesafe laser range finder, a day TV video cam› era,  acoustic  sensors,  and  advanced  processing.  The  program  will  be

managed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Night  Vision  and  Electronic  Sensors Directorate at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

During  FY  1994  the  enhanced  position  location  reporting  system (EPLRS),  a  major  component  of the  Army  Data  Dish·ibution  System (ADDS),  began  low-rate  production  after  the  Army  completed  initial operational  testing  and  evaluation on  the system. ADDS  provides com› manders a tactical data system to support the Army tactical command and control system and other battlefield automated systems. It is  intended to provide near real-time data distribution in division and corps areas  in an anticipated electronic countermeasures environment. EPLRS is for medi› um-speed data distribution. The other major component of  ADDS is  the joint tactical information distribution system (JTIDS) for high-speed data distribution. JTIDS continued engineering development during FY 1994.

Army aviation Longbow Hellfire and laser Hellfire missile develop› ment continued in FY 1994. Longbow Hellfire, a fire-and-forget, adverse weather, air-to-ground missile is used primarily to defeat armored vehicles or other mobile targets. It uses a radio-frequency millimeter wave seeker to  find  and  lock  on  to  targets  and  is  an  integral  part  of the  AI- I- 64D Longbow  Apache  and  RAH- 66  Comanche  programs.  Twenty-five Longbow Hellfire developmental tests met all major objectives during the fiscal year.

Laser  Hellfire  is an  air-to-ground  missile  system  of  the  AH- 64 Apache, OH- 58D Kiowa Warrior, Special Operations helicopters, and the RAH- 66 Comanche to defeat armored vehicles and other individual point targets.  The  missile  locks  on  to  reflected  laser  energy  provided  by  the launching aircraft or other remote  designator. The Army awarded a first production contract for the optimized version, Hellfire II (AGM- 114K), in  May  1993,  with  deliveries  scheduled  for  FY  1995.  The  improved Hellfire II included hardening of the laser seeker countermeasures, war› head improvements to defeat advanced reactive armor, elech·onic fuzing, and modifications in length and weight. The Army awarded a second pro› duction contract for 3,905 missiles in February 1994.

The  Army  worked  on  development  of  an  Advanced  Precision Airborne Delivery  System  (APADS)  during  FY  1994  to  get equipment and supplies to the battlefield when vehicular resupply  is unavailable or unfeasible. Traditionally,  the Army  has relied  on standard parachutes to deliver such materiel. The APADS will deliver goods with more accuracy, in less optimal conditions, and from higher altitudes than current delivery systems. APADS  will use a packaged, nonrigid wing that extends when pulled from the rear of  a C- 130, C- 141, or C- 17 aircraft by a drogue para› chute. Once the APADS platform stabilizes itself, it snaps into its gliding wing  configuration.  From  there,  the  global  positioning  system  (GPS) guidance package directs the cargo to within meters of  its target location.

Unlike  contemporary parachutes,  the APADS  glider will  perform accu› rately even in  winds up  to 20  knots, and depending on the altitude of  the C- 130, C- 141, or C- 17, the glider will be able to use a series ofturns and maneuvers to deliver its payload up to forty miles from the site and at alti› tudes of  25,000 feet or more.

The  challenges  of airdropping  humanitarian  supplies  into  Bosnia› llcrzcgovina during Operation PROVIDE PROMISE in FY 1994 led the Army to develop a bigger parachute, the G- 120 (Modified). This is a modified version of  an older parachute, which allows high-velocity parachutes to be dropped at lower velocity. The new modifications were designed by para› chute riggers from the Army's 5th Quartermaster Detachment in collabo› ration  with  parachute riggers  from  the  German and French armies. The modification met the Air Force's high-altitude and high-velocity require› ments and reduced the  likelihood of  wind  blowing the parachutes off  tar› get.  The  previously  used  parachutes  measured 26  feet  in  diameter  and could deliver a 2,200-pound bundle. The G- 12Ds (Modified) are approx› imately six times larger and can support four 2,200-pound bundles.

The Army awarded two contracts for two variations of  the Ml6A2 M4 carbine. The value of the contracts, to  total  24,000  units,  is estimated at $11  million.  The  M4  carbine  will  replace  selected  pistols,  submachine guns,  and  Ml6 rifles.  It provides  increased flexibility for those soldiers assigned to  crew-served weapons and soldiers who carry or operate large mission-essential equipment.  Its  compact size also  allows  users the full usc  of both  hands  to  accomplish  their  primary  missions.  The  contract awards include a variation of the M4, the M4Al, which will be fielded to special  operations personnel. The M4Al incorporates an enhanced upper receiver with a "Picatirmy rail," which enables users to· mount various day and night sighting devices on the weapon to improve overall effectiveness.

Under a January  1994 contract, the Army continued development of the  offensive  handgun  weapon  system  (OHWS)  for  the  U.S.  Special Operations Command. The complete OHWS includes three components: a new .45-caliber pistol, a laser aiming module, and a sound and flash sup› pressor.  Production requirements  call  for 7,500  pistols,  1,950  of which would include the laser aiming module and sound and flash suppressor.

The Army conducted duty performance testing on three new ocean› going tugboats in FY L994, the first such vessels built for the Army since the  1950s. Two  128-foot tugs were delivered to the Army Reserve's 949th Transportation Company in Baltimore, Maryland, and one was delivered to the 73d Transportation Company at Fort Eustis, Virginia. The tugboats, which cost approximately $15 million each, are among six being built for the service. The Army's last new tug was designed for coastal towing. The new  tugs are designed for longer-range towing of large ships and ocean› going barges.

Equipment fielding also continued during the  fiscal year. The Army fielded  OH-58D Kiowa helicopters to  two  battalions in the 2d Infantry Division and one in the Mississippi National Guard. The three assault heli› copter battalions  of the  lOlst Airborne Division (Air Assault)  received new UH-60L Black Hawk utility helicopters. Initial fielding began for the new TH- 67  Creek helicopters. The  MlAl  Abrams  tank was  fielded  to selected active  component and National  Guard units,  as  well  as  to pre› positioned stocks. The Army fielded the Bradley fighting vehicle to pre› positioned  stocks  afloat  and  ashore,  as  well  as  to  battalions  of the Mississippi  National Guard and the  1st and 2d Infantry Divisions. The Heavy  Equipment  Transport  System  was  issued  to the 1st  Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, two National Guard brigades, Army Reserve transportation companies, and pre-positioned stocks afloat. Initial fielding  began  of the  AN/PSN- 11  precision  lightweight  GPS  receiver, known  as  PLGR. The year  also  witnessed the fielding  of several  field artillery systems. The 24th Infantry Division fielded the Ml09A6 Paladin 155-mm.  self-propelled  howitzer  and  the  Field  Artillery  Ammunition Supply Vehicle. Two active component battalions and one National Guard battalion fielded the MLRS. Three battalions in the 25th Infantry Division and a battery in the Southern European Task Force fielded  the Mll9Al 105-mm.  towed  howitzer.  Finally,  initial  fielding  of the  Fire  Direction Data Manager began.

## Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation (MWR)

The Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) provides a process in which the Army monitors and improves  the  quality of life for  all Army members (active duty soldiers, reserve component soldiers, retirees, Department of the Army civilians, and family members). As part of the AFAP process, forums or symposia develop and set priorities for issues, a steering com› mittee reviews progress on  resolution of the  issues, and  an AFAP docu› ment  provides  feedback  to  the  community.  This  program  operates  at installation, major command (MACOM), and Headquarters, Department of  the Army, levels.

Each  October  the  Army  hosts  a  worldwide  AFAP  conf erence  in Washington,  D.C.,  where after a week of working group meetings dele› gates  present their key issues  to  the Vice  Chief of Staff, Army.  Because these  issues  reflect the prominent  forces and  stresses faced  in units and communities throughout the Army, the AFAP enables the Army's leaders to  identify and deal with important influences on readiness and retention.

The A.tmy MACOMs submitted ninety-seven issues of  concern during FY 1994 for review at the October 1994 AFAP Planning Conference. One› third of  the issues involved  pay, entitlements,  and retiree benefits. Approximately one-fourth  of the  issues  dealt with  topics related  to  forc· e support.  Soldier education  was  the  primary focus  of the  conference,  and one-fifth of  the issues addressed medical and dental concerns such as access to care, health care at closing installations, and expanded dental insurance.

Conference delegates gave twenty-seven issues priority  as key  con› cerns and elevated them to the Chief  of  Staff, Army (CSA), to be approved for action by the Army Staff. A vote of  the 130 delegates in attendance at the  conferenc. e  told  the  A.t·my's leaders  that  the  major  concern  of the Army's members in 1994 was insufficient pay. The rest of  the "Top Five" issues  for  the  1994 AFAP  were  survivor benefits  for service-connected deaths, the computation of child care fees, the erosion of  retiree and sur› vivor health benefits, and Army family and retiree access to military and

civilian health services. Other key issues were the shortage of  funding for housing and barracks, substance abuse and violence among Army youth, and increased commissary access for the reserve components.

In FY 1994, during its first full  year of  operation, the MWR Board of Directors assumed an active leadership role, providing vision and direc› tion to steer Army MWR toward growth and financial stability. The MWR Board  of Directors  is  composed  of the  Army's commanders  for  U.S. Forces,  Korea;  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command;  U.S.  Army,  Europe;  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command; U.S.  Army Materiel Command; and  U.S.  Army,  Pacific.  Meeting  biennially,  the  Board  of Directors  is responsible for approving major MWR management strategies, plans, and programs.

During the year, a period characterized by downsizing and diminish› ing resources,  the MWR Board of Directors supported four major initia› tives.  First,  the Board established financial standards to serve as  bench› marks for MWR programs and encourage fiscal responsibility at all lev› els of operation. These standards were designed to  help  commanders by identifying appropriated fund levels of  support for mission-essential pro› grams and establishing nonappropriated fund fiscal goals. These standards provided  a  uniform method  of evaluating  local  financial  performance. Second, the Board produced the Army MWR Vision for the 21st Century and the Army MWR Strategic Action Plan. Taken together, these two doc› uments  set  forth  goals,  objectives,  and  actions  designed  to  ensure  that MWR becomes a customer-driven program managed with  business-like practices. Third, the Board conducted a standard patron survey to support MWR triennial needs assessment. Over the next two years and once every three years thereafter, each installation and the Army as a whole will have valid marketing research data upon which to base program innovation and modification.  Fourth,  the  Board  supported  adoption  of an  automated information system, which will enhance the manager's ability to collect, process, and store the financial and operational data needed to optimize programs. This computer-based system will be funded centrally at a cost of  $40 million and fielded at every installation in  the Army.

The Army Family Team  Building Program was designed  to  provide training for soldiers, deployable civilian employees, and family members to  enable  them to  cope  better  with  the  stress of deployment and  family separation.  In  1992, as a result of lessons learned from  the  Persian Gulf War,  a  diverse  working  group,  representative of the  Army,  convened to examine options that might reduce the demands and frustration of  deploy› ment and family  separation. The working group  recommended  that sol› diers,  deployable civilians,  and  family  members  receive  training in the expectations of  military life, as well as their individual responsibilities, for self  and  family  preparation.  This  concept,  called  Army  Family  Team

Building, was approved in February 1993 by the CSA. The program has three purposes: to improve overall readiness of the force  by teaching and promoting personal and family readiness tlu·ough progressive and sequen› tial education; to assist the Army in adapting to the changes from reduced budgets  and  downsizing;  and to  respond  to  family  issues  using  lessons learned from recent deployments.

Army Family Team Building training for soldiers was introduced into the Army Training and Doctrine Command school system  in November 1993. Training for civilians began in April 1994. Family member training (for active, National Guard, Army Reserve, and civilian family members) began in June 1994. Successful implementation of  the Army Family Team Building  Program  ensures  that  all members  of the  Army  are  better informed aboutArmy missions and the expectations of  military life, readi› ness responsibilities during separation and deployment, and systems avail› able to support  more  self-reliant, independent,  and  self-sufficient lifestyles.

The  Army  Community  and  Family  Support  Center  (CFSC)  estab› lished  a  Better  Opportunities  for  Single  Soldiers  (BOSS)  program  to address the needs of  single soldiers in 1989. BOSS is the communication link  between  single  soldiers,  including  single  parents  and  geographic bachelors, and the command. Through BOSS, soldiers address single-sol› dier concerns through the chain of command and provide valuable input to the command.

The BOSS program made tremendous strides in FY 1994 as the CFSC staff  conducted and participated in a variety of  events. At the fourth annu› al Army-wide BOSS training conference in November  1993, CFSC and civilian  instructors  trained  more  than  120  soldiers,  senior  noncommis› sioned  officers,  and  civilian  program  managers.  During  May  1994  a Commissary Patron Awareness Program was launched at  15  installations to familiarize young soldiers with savings that can be realized by shopping at commissaries. The CFSC staff  conducted formal BOSS training for 180 soldiers at twelve posts,  and  by  the  end of September  1994 BOSS pro› grams were  in operation at aJI  installations  with garrison populations of more than fifty single soldiers.

## Food Service

In March  1994  the  MWR  Board  of Directors  endorsed  plans  to reverse  losing  trends  in  club  operations  through  the  adoption  of brand› name  food  and  beverage  establishments.  In  May 1994  at  Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, a contractor conducted the first of  a series of food,  beverage, and entertainment assessments. Similar assessments were conducted at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Fort Lee, Virginia. These assess-

ments contributed to  the decision to introduce brand-name food and bev› erage establishments to club operations.

An  initial  list of brand-name food  and  beverage establishments was developed by a group from the CrSC and the MACOMs, later formalized as the Food, Beverage, and Entertainment Steering Committee. Food and beverage  brand-name establishments  included  Primo's Italian  restaurant (pizza,  pasta,  and  subs);  Sam's Roadhouse  restaurant (steaks,  ribs,  and chicken); the Main Street restaurant (regional American cuisine); Reggie's (deli-style  sandwiches  and  specialty  burgers);  and  a  sports  arena/high energy nightclub. On 15 June 1994, Primo's,  with seating capacity of 152, opened at Fort IJood, Texas, becoming the first of  the Army's  brand-name restaurants.  Primo's was  a  cooperative  eff ort  of Fort  Uood,  U.S.  Army Forces Command, and the Community and Family Support Center.

In  July 1994  the Executive  Committee  of  the MWR  Board  of Directors  approved  $1 million  in  new-venture  funding  to  support  the development of brand-name  food  and  beverage establishments  at  Army installations. Funds would become available in FY 1995 and be limited to $200,000 per project with at least an 80 percent/20 percent split between the Army MWR Recreation Fund  and the installation. Installations desir› ing to compete for the FY 1995 new-venture funding were advised to sub› mit their  requests  to  be  reviewed  and  rated  by  the  Steering Committee, which is scheduled to meet in December 1994.

## Health and Medical Programs

During  FY  1994  the  provisional  U.S.  Army Medical  Command (MEDCOM) began merging the  functions  of the Office  of the  Surgeon General  and  the  Health  Services  Command. The  merger  represented  a move  toward  a more accessible, deployable, accountable, and  integrated Army Medical Department (AMEDD). As part of  the Army's  streamlining and downsizing efforts, the Army redesignated and  reorganized  the U.S. Army  Environmental  Hygiene  Agency  (USAEHA)  as  the  U.S.  Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) on 1 August 1994, with a provisional status and a commanding general. The USAEHA had supported the worldwide preventive medicine programs of the Army, the Department of  Defense (DOD), and other federal agencies through  consultations,  supportive  services,  investigations,  and  training. USACHPPM  assumed  command  and  control  over  USAEHA,  which included  USAEIIA,  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground,  Maryland;  USAEHA District  Support  Activity- North, fort  Meade,  Maryland;  USAEHA District Support Activity- South, Fort McPherson, Georgia; and USAEIIA District Support  Activity- West, f itzsimons  Army  Medical  Center, Colorado. In addition, USACHPPM assumed the mission funds and assets

within the Division of Preventive Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center,  Washington,  D.C.;  assumed  control over  the  Army  Pacific Environmental  Health  Engineering Agency  in  Sagami,  Japan;  assumed control  of the  1Oth  Medical  Laboratory  in  Landstuhl,  Germany,  on  1 October 1994; and established new directorates in Health Promotion and Wellness,  Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance, and Field Preventive Medicine. USACHPPM will provide second- and third-echelon support to Health Service Support Areas (HSSAs) and their headquarters,  medical treatment  facilities, Medical  Commands  (Provisional),  and other Department of the  Army  and  DOD  elements.  First-echelon  preventive medicine will continue to  be provided by Preventive Medicine  Services under the Medical Treatment Facility conunanders and through preventive medicine units.

In March  1994  the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Research and  Development Command, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency, and the U.S. Army Health Facility Planning Agency merged to establish the provisional U.S. Army  Medical  Research,  Development,  Acquisition,  and  Logistics Command (USAMRDALC). The provisional USAMRDALC was estab› lished as a transitional organization. USAMRDALC temporarily assumed responsibility for the management of medical materiel for the Army and for planning, programming, and budgeting for construction of new med› ical facilities. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Conm1and (USAMRMC), planned for establishment in November 1994, will replace the provisional USAMRDALC.

In  April 1994  the  provisional  USAMRDALC  participated  in  an Advanced Warfighter Experiment at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, where the Army tested  new battlefield applications of digital  technology to support the development of  Force XXI.  A  USAM› RDALC Telemedicine Project Management  Team demonstrated key med› ical care applications for the digitized  battlefield, such as  telementoring, the projection of  medical expertise from rear to forward areas, and digital moulage, the transmission of  medical imagery over tactical radio.

During the fiscal year one of  the most sweeping reorganizations in the history of  Army dental delivery occurred with the establislm1ent of  a sep› arate  Dental  Command  (DENCOM)  as  a  subordinate  element  of the MEDCOM. Driven by downsizing and reorganization of  the Army and the AMEDD,  the  new  DENCOM  established  an  Army  Dental  Service Delivery System under a single dental command with worldwide authori› ty over all Table of  Distribution and Allowances dental units. Dental units were  grouped  under  eight  Dental  Service  Support Areas.  Adjustments were made in the sizes of  dental commands, resulting in 31  dental activi› ties  and 20  smaller dental  clinic  commands.  During this  period  clinics provided treatment to  1,794,791  active duty soldiers, 36,999 active duty

members of other U.S.  services,  and  522,300  others.  Dental  commands performed a total  of 18,141,194 dental  procedures. The DENCOM also operated two Area Dental Laboratories that provided prosthetic support for units worldwide on a triservice basis.

The  Veterinary  Command  (VETCOM),  a  major  subordinate  com› mand  of the  MEDCOM,  was  provisionally  activated  on  12  November 1993.  The VETCOM's major activities include  food  safety  and  animal medicine. The VETCOM is the DOD executive agent for food safety and quality assurance, as well as animal medicine. A top priority in food safe› ty and quality assurance is involvement in the operational ration program. The VETCOM provides veterinary services to DOD-owned animals that include horses, dogs,  and marine animals, as  well as  offering preventive medical services to privately owned pets at DOD installations.

The VETCOM commanded and controlled seven veterinary service support areas in the continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii  in FY 1994.  Veterinary  services  of  the  Medical  Center  and  Medical Department activity were consolidated into seventeen veterinary service support districts. A significant reduction in overhead was accomplished, and authorizations were redistributed in VETCOM to  support better the DOD mission.

During the  fiscal  year the AMEDD  revamped  its  purchasing proce› dures. The purchasing refom1 stemmed from the findings of  two blue rib› bon presidential commissions that investigated ways to improve the feder› al  government in  the  1980s. The commission advocated adopting com› mercial business practices. Following this recommendation, the AMEDD investigated the commercial market. Looking at the relationship between commercial  medical  distributors  and  civilian  hospitals,  the  AMEDD found  that these hospitals made extensive use of  prime vendors formed› ical products supply (pharmaceuticals and other medical-surgical  items). A prime vendor is defined as "a single distributor of brand specific med› ical supplies for a given group of  hospitals in a given geographic region." By committing to a single source whose warehouse is off  hospital proper› ty,  hospitals were able to obtain better pricing,  receive next-day  delivery, reduce or convert warehouse space, and reduce employees. The AMEDD committed to the  use  of prime vendors to  obtain the same  benefits. The Department ofVeterans Affairs and the Defense Personnel Support Center wrote and administered prime vendor contracts to  support the AMEDD, beginning in 1993.

In FY  1994 contracts were  in  place that enabled  twenty-tlu·ee out of forty AMEDD hospitals to obtain their pharmaceutical support from prime vendors. Although the strength of  prime vendors is delivery to fixed facil› ities with established, stable demand patterns, the AMEDD also had cus› tomers  with  mobile  missions  who  activated  and  deployed  to  clisis areas

worldwide. During the fiscal year the AMEDD expanded the use of  prime vendors to  one of  these units, the  I  47th Medical Logistics Battalion, in its peacetime role in the United States. Within months, a portion of  the 147th deployed to Guantanamo, Cuba, for Operation SAFE  HAVEN  and used prime vendors for support. This marked the first use ever of  prime vendors to sup› port  Table of Organization and Equipment units outside the United States. Later in the  year the 32d Medical Logistics  Battalion,  using  a  different prime vendor, supported Operation SAFE HAVEN in Haiti.

In FY 1994 the Army also adopted plans to  revamp its medical mili› tary occupational specialties (MOS's). More than 30,000 active duty and 35,000 reserve component soldiers will be  affected by a restructuring of twenty-two  MOS's in  the  medical  field.  The  changes,  to  take  effect  1 October 1994, will make the medical specialist MOS 91B a prerequisite for  most other medical MOS  's.  People  in most medical  specialties will enter  the  Army  as  91Bs.  After  eighteen  months  they  may  apply  for Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) training. Once trained, they will be qual› ified  to  work  in  their ASI.  When they  reach the rank of sergeant,  first class, they will revert to 91Bs.

Being consolidated as ASis  under 91B are MOS's 91H, Orthopedic Specialist;  91J,  Physical Therapy Specialist;  91L,  Occupational Therapy Specialist; 91  U, Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist; and 91 Y, Eye Specialist. In  addition,  master  sergeants  and  sergeants  major  in  the  42E  MOS, Optical Laboratory Specialist, will become 91Bs. The 91N MOS, Cardiac Care Specialist, will be eliminated and its ASI attached to the 91B MOS.

Initial  training  as  a  91B  will  also  be  a  prerequisite  for  continued schooling in the  MOS  's  91 K,  Medical  Laboratory  Specialist; 91 Q, Pharmacy  Specialist;  91P,  Radiology  Specialist;  and  91D, Operating Room Specialist.  At the rank  of master  sergeant,  91Ds  will  convert to 91Bs. The restructuring will not change unit authorizations and is expect› ed to increase promotion prospects for affected soldiers.

The drawdown of the Chaplain Corps continued during PY  1994 in order to reach the Corps' allocated strength numbers. The Corps partici› pated in the Voluntary Separation Incentive Program, the Voluntary Early Release and Retirement Program, and Selective Early Retirement Boards to  help  meet its  end-strength numbers. The downsizing affected all  per› sonnel, including officers and noncommissioned officers.

The continuing shortage of  Roman Catholic priests as chaplains posed an additional concern to the Corps. Roman Catholics composed approxi› mately 25 percent of the population of the United States in FY 1994, but Roman  Catholic  chaplains  composed  approximately  10  percent  of the

Chaplain  Corps as  their numbers continued to  decline. The  number of Roman Catholic chaplains declined from 140 to  122 during FY 1994 out of  an active and reserve component force of  more than 3,000 chaplains, of which more than 1  ,200 were active duty chaplains.

The Chaplain Corps did expand in one area in FY 1994. As part of  a continuing policy of reconfiguring its personnel  structure  to  mirror the increasing diversity of the nation's population, the first Muslim chaplain entered the Corps. In response to approximately 4 percent of  active duty soldiers  being Muslim, Captain Abdul Rasheed Muhammad became the first  chaplain  representing  a  non-Judeo-Christian  faith.  Along  similar lines, the Chaplain Corps also authorized a Buddhist chaplain position.

## Army Pay

The Clinton administration submitted a defense budget for  1994 that did not provide for a military pay raise. Congress, however, approved a 2.2 percent raise, effective  1 January  1994,  that applied  to  basic  pay,  basic allowance  for  quarters,  and basic  allowance  for  subsistence.  The Employment Cost Index (ECI), a gauge of  growth in private sector wages used to measure relative differences in military and civilian pay, revealed that  military  pay  lagged  behind  civilian  pay  by  12.3  percent  as  of 1 January 1994. The law mandated that future military pay raises equal the previous year's  ECI minus one-half  of  a percentage point. The Department of  Labor announced that the ECI increased 3.1  percent over the previous year, indicating a 2.6 percent pay raise for 1995. The administration's  five› year economic plan called for military and civilian raises of zero for FY 1994 and a one percentage point reduction from  law for the succeeding five years. This was a part of  the deficit reduction package sponsored by the administration.

## Army Housing

The Army continued efforts to provide better living conditions to  its soldiers in FY 1994. For the single soldier, the Army's goal was to trans› form  existing  barracks  into  single-soldier  communities.  The  Army's Whole Barracks Renewal Program provided funds for the construction of new barracks and the renovation of  older barracks to make them more like homes. Enhancements under this program included 110 square feet of  liv› ing space for each junior enlisted soldier, walk-in closets, more parking space,  and  a  laundry,  day  room,  kitchen,  and mailroom in  each  soldier community building.  Supply and administrative areas currently in many barracks will be moved to separate company operations facilities. At the goal of  $250 million a year for this effort, it will take approximately twen-

ty-three years  to  upgrade  the Army's entire inventory of aging, substan› dard  barracks.  Until  they  can  be upgraded  or  replaced  under  Whole Barracks  Renewal,  failed  infrastructure  systems  in  older barracks  will require  extensive  maintenance  and  repair efforts  managed under a  new program, Bridging the  Gap.  During the fiscal year installations through› out the Army implemented local bridging-the-gap initiatives to make life better for single soldiers.  Projects included repairs to such major compo› nents  as  heating  and  air  conditioning  systems,  roofs,  latrines,  laundry facilities, plumbing,  and  electrical  systems.  Projects  like  these  were accomplished  using  installation  engineer  assets,  job  order  contracting, civilian contracts, troop labor, and self-help.

Army family housing provides essential support to military families, especially  at  installations  where  off-post  housing  is  limited  and  very expensive.  With  the  Whole  Neighborhood  Revitalization  Program,  the Army initiated a major effort to upgrade its over-aged family quarters to current standards. A major portion of  the Army's family housing invento› ry  in FY 1994 was between thirty-five and forty years old, in poor condi› tion, and in need of  revitalization. Funding for Army Family Housing has declined 30 percent since FY 1985, while the inventory has declined only 17  percent,  thereby  limiting the Army's ability  to  maintain even  current standards. The Army's goal is to upgrade or replace, but not increase, the inventory over a period of  years.

## Army Safety Program

Through the comprehensive application of  risk management, accident prevention, regulatory compliance, and safety education, promotion, and planning, the Army Safety Program continued to decrease the number of ground and aviation accidents during FY 1994. Ground accidents involv› ing major property loss, personal injury, or fatality, categorized as Class A through C,  declined from 9.04 per thousand soldiers in 1990 to  6.04 in 1994, a one-third decrease in overall accidents. Accidents involving pri› vately owned vehicles (POVs) remained the number-one killer of  soldiers. Since 1990, however, POV accidents and fatalities  have  declined overall by  68  percent for automobiles and 52 percent for motorcycles. In Army motor vehicle operations since 1990, accidents have been reduced by 53 percent and fatalities by 24 percent. While the number of  personnel i~ury fatalities  has  increased by  eight percent since  1990, the total number of personnel injuries has decreased by 46 percent. Furthermore, the rate per thousand revealed a decrease in overall personnel injuries by about one› third, reflecting a general decline in Army accidents. The Army has also reduced the number of  training-related accidents since 1990 by 51  percent and fatalities  by  48 percent.  In part this decrease reflects the downsizing

of  the Army, but the rates of  training accidents and fatalities per thousand showed significant decreases of 36 percent and 31  percent, respectively. Class A Aviation  flight  accidentsresulting  in  property  damage  of $1 million or more or resulting in a fatality or permanent total  disability› were 1.64 per 100,000 flight hours in FY 1994, compared to 1.83 in 1990. FY  1994  marked  the  second  lowest  accident  rate  during  the  period 1990-1994. The lowest rate occurred in FY 1992, with 1.57 accidents per 100,000 flight hours.

## Army Career and  Alumni Program

During FY 1994 the Army Career and Alumni Program (ACAP) con› tinued to demonstrate its effectiveness in counseling active duty soldiers who were voluntarily or involuntarily separating from the Army. ACAP is a comprehensive program that orchestrates a broad spectrum of  transition assistance services for  military personnel  and  their families as they pre› pare to leave active duty. In a highly organized process, soldiers and fam› ily members receive career guidance, benefits counseling, and civilian job search assistance through a combination of in-house and contractor ser› vices.  The  program  also  makes  use of  services  available  from  the Department  of Veterans  Affairs,  the  Department  of Labor,  and  state employment organizations. The ACAP  synchronizes available  transition services, and it provides clients with skill training for private sector inter› views, a personal resume, a working knowledge of  the civilian job market, and a personalized individual transition plan.

Since its inception in  1990, ACAP  has  reduced by  three  weeks  the time it takes clients to find their first  job, with resultant cost savings to the federal government in unemployment compensation benefit payments to eligible soldiers in transition. These cost savings have also contributed to a reduction in Army payments of  unemployment compensation for ex-ser› vice members (UCX) from $265 million, with 78,729 eligible clients, in FY 1992 to  $17  million,  with 58,852  eligible clients,  in  FY  1994. The UCX per capita cost fell from $3,365 in FY 1992 to $1,991  in FY 1994.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) faced the impact in FY 1994 of significant changes that were initiated in  1993  to prepare for  the  challenges  of the  future.  The  immediate  challenges,  however, proved greater than anticipated and led to a decline in AAFES revenues and in dividends paid to Army installations in FY 1994. AAFES attributed this  decline  primarily  to  the  continued  rapid  drawdown  of its  primary active duty customers, especially in Europe, and  the leveling of  deferred

payment plan sales. While the reductions of  active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve forces were anticipated, the rapidity of the reductions and the impact of  the earlier than planned withdrawal in Europe were sig› nificant. For example, active duty customers, including family members, declined by 10.2 percent between  1992 and 1994. This reduction was not offset by an increase in retirees. Nor could the reduction in customers be offset  by  increased  marketing efforts.  At the same time,  the leveling of deferred payment plan sales occurred faster than expected due to AAFES' action to limit new account credit levels for junior enlisted personnel, E-1 through  E-4,  to  $500.  AAFES  then  suffered  a  21  percent  decline  in deferred payment plan sales. AAFES earned $269.5 million in FY 1994, a decline of 14.5  percent from  1993, and paid Army  installations a divi› dend of$110.73 million in FY 1994, as compared with $123.37 million in FY  993. J

In a significant departure from its traditional activities, AAFES start› ed providing dental services in FY 1994, through an  agreement with the MWR Panel and the DOD. In June AAFES began offering family-mem› ber dental care at the Fairbanks Dental Clinic at Fort Hood, Texas. The new  service  resulted  from  an  Army  Health  Services  Command  policy change in  1993. Under the revised policy the families of  active duty sol› diers in CONUS eligible for the family member dental plan were restrict› ed to  space-available  and  emergency  dental  care  in  Army  facilities. AAFES launched its dental care initiative at Fort Hood after the new pol› icy substantially  reduced access of  Army family members and retirees to military dental facilities.

## Command Information

In FY 1994 the Office of  the Chief  of Public Affairs devoted special attention to  supporting major Ariny deployments and contingency opera› tions.  Army Public Affairs journalists,  photographers, and broadcasters covered  these  events  at  home  and  abroad.  For instance,  when  the Mississippi River Hooded  homes throughout the Midwest, Army Public Affairs  reported  on Army  soldiers  filling  sandbags  and evacuating  the waterlogged;  and  when an earthquake damaged property and disrupted lives in Los Angeles, California, Army Public Affairs was there covering soldiers picking up the pieces. Overseas, Army Public Affairs coverage included  humanitarian  assistance  to  Rwandan  refugees,  Haitian  relief efforts  at  Guantanamo,  Cuba,  and  deployment  of Army  soldiers  to Zagreb, Croatia, in  support of  United Nations humanitarian relief opera› tions in Bosnia.

The  Office  of the  Chief of Public  Affairs  broke  new  ground  in broadcasting during the fiscal year. Soldiers Radio and Television devel-

oped a new television newscast, "Army Newswatch," to provide a glob› al  look  at  men and  women  serving  in  the  Army.  "Army  Newswatch" made its debut on  28 July  1994.  By the end of the  fiscal year the pro› gram was being broadcast to fifty-one Army installations and more than 30 cities in the continental United States. The broadcast also was shown in thirty-four countries through the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service.

## Army Tuition Assistance Program

Army tuition  assistance policy  underwent  a  significant revision  in FY 1994.  Demand for  tuition  assistance  exceeded  available  resources from  FY  1991  to  FY  1994.  This  dilemma  caused  tuition  assistance inequities and policy inconsistencies throughout the Army that resulted in  soldier complaints  to  Congress. To  correct  these  problems,  in  April 1994 the Army leadership convened a task force made up of a cross-sec› tion  of Army  personnel.  Based  on  task  force  recommendations,  the Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  for  Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs directed  that a new Army tuition assistance policy be  implemented on  1 October 1994.

Under the new policy all active duty soldiers will be authorized up to nine semester hours (or the equivalent) per fiscal  year at 75  percent of tuition cost, not to exceed established maximums, for courses leading to a certificate or degree.  Soldiers serving in  CONUS  will  be  subject to  the following maximum amounts per semester hour:

| a. Lower level (freshman and sophomore years)   | $60.00   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------|
| b. Upper level Uunior and senior years)         | $85.00   |
| c. Graduate level                               | $170.00  |

Soldiers serving outside CONUS will be subject to maximums estab› lished by existing education services contracts. In addition, soldiers with› out  a  high  school  diploma  will  continue  to  be  authorized  l 00  percent tuition  assistance  for  courses  leading  to  completion  of their diploma  or equivalent.

The changes are intended to ensure a standardized, consistent Army› wide tuition assistance policy during a period of  fiscal constraint. The pre› vious  fifteen-semester-hour  policy  was  not  consistently  implemented. Many installations rart  out of tuition  assistance money before the end of the  fiscal  year  or  lowered  the amounts  to  fit  reduced budgets  and increased  demand.  This  caused  confusion  and  soldier  dissatisfaction, especially as  soldiers experienced different applications of tuition  assis› tance policy as they moved from one installation to  another.

## Army Postal Operations

In FY 1994 Army postal operations moved closer to adopting nine› digit contingency  zip  codes.  The  Department  of  the  Army  Postal Conference  held  in  March  1994  examined  the  use  of contingency  zip codes differentiated by the use of "APO AE 093  ." Two Forces Command units, the  27th  Engineer  Battalion  and the 129th  Adjutant  General Company (Postal),  conducted  small-scale testing that provided valuable information on adopting nine-digit contingency zip codes. Based on the success  of the  limited  test,  the Army  planned to  make  final  the  Forces Command postal improvements and initiate the program Army-wide.

The use of  nine-digit contingency zip codes during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti at the end ofFY 1994 provided a full-scale test of  the new zip codes as well as of the ability of MACOMs to activate and pro› vide mail routing for the units.  Zip codes were assigned at the company level, enabling the U.S. Postal Service to sort mail in CONUS for dispatch to  the  area  of operations.  Operation UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY  also  saw  the increased use of reserve  component postal companies supporting postal operations in a contingency theater.

## Total Army Quality

The  intent  of the National  Performance  Review,  according  to  Vice President Albert Gore in May  1993, was to  bring to the  federal govern› ment the "quality revolution" that pervaded business and  industry in the late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  In  that same period  the Army had  already made great strides toward the institutionalization of  Total Army Quality (TAQ), the Army's  management philosophy adopted in 1992. In February 1993 the  Army  published  a  TAQ  concept  plan  for  implementation, Leadership for Total Army Quality, which defined the methodology, tools, and techniques to perform systematic analysis of organizations and busi› ness  practices to  achieve  desired  improvements. By FY  1994 TAQ  was established in all Army MACOMs, most of  which had instituted command visions  and guiding principles and had developed a structure to  manage change within the organization.

The Army's efforts to  imbed TAQ  continued  during FY  1994 with the service's nomination of  five Army organizations for the President's Quality Awards, which recognize organizations that demonstrate excep› tional  results.  For  the  first  time  in  the  history  of the  award,  an Army organization, the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development, and  Engineering Center,  won the Quality Improvement  Prototype Award. The Red River Army Depot was recognized as  a finalist for an award as well.

## HISTORICAL SUMMARY: FISCAL YEAR 1994

## Army Sports Program

The Army's  sports program provides soldier-athletes the opportunity to participate in armed forces,  national, and international competitions. The Army began the 1994 Armed Forces Sports calendar year by winning the Armed Forces Boxing Quadrennial  Championship.  For the first  time  in armed forces championship history, one service, the Army, won all twelve weight divisions. Other notable Army sports accomplishments included the Army Women's Basketball Team sweeping undefeated through the Annual Armed Forces Women's  Basketball Championship double elimination tour› nament; the Army Men's Basketball Team taking the Marine Corps to  the "if necessary" game of the double elimination 1994 Armed Forces Men's Basketball Championship (losing in the final); the Armed Forces Wrestling Team, led by World Class Athlete Program Army wrestlers, capturing the United  States  National  Greco-Roman  Wrestling  title;  and  the  Army Wrestling Team taking  first place  team  titles  in both  Greco-Roman and Freestyle Armed Forces Wrestling Championships.

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

The Corps of  Engineers had a productive year, executing 98 percent of its total FY 1994 and  prior military construction (MILCON) projects. The ARNG executed 79 percent of its FY 1994 and prior MILCON pro› jects. Table 17 summarizes these projects.

The Guard's MILCON backlog and unfunded requirements, however, totaled  more than  3  billion,  representing nearly  2,000 construction pro› jects.  The  backlog  continued  to  grow  from  previous  years  because  of equipment modernization, new missions, unit reorganizations, health and

I

safety  criteria  modernization,  and  revitalization  and  rehabilitation  of aging facilities. To continue to accomplish its mission as it waited for new construction, expansion, or modernization of  existing facilities, the Guard made maximum use of  existing facilities, leased facilities, and temporary facilities.

The Army Reserve MILCON program in FY 1994 was formulated to meet the  requirements of the  high-priority contingency-force pool  units, to  perform new-mission training tasks, and to address the worst cases of unit overcrowding  and  deteriorated  facilities.  The MILCON  backlog  is holding steady in the Army Reserve, $2.0 billion in FY 1993 and $1.9 bil› lion in FY 1994, only because the downsizing of  units has temporarily off› set the  backlog growth.  The backlog  will continue to  grow  because the pattern  in  annual  funding does  not  meet requirements for revitalization. Until the Army Reserve can receive MILCON funding to meet revitaliza› tion  needs  and start  reducing  the  backlog,  units  will  continue to  suffer from  Jack  of adequate  training,  storage,  and  maintenance  facilities.  All shortfalls affect training, supply,  maintenance, readiness, morale, recruit› ing, and retention.

The backlog of  maintenance and repair (BMAR) is a measurement of the condition of  the Army's owned real  properly. The BMAR comes from the planning of  a maintenance and repair project, which is included on the Annual Work Plan of  installations, and remains an unfinanced requirement at  the  end of the  fiscal year.  The BMAR reflects  specific  categories  of facilities: barracks, utility systems, training facilities, community facilities, and hospital and other medical facilities are examples.  BMAR properties require some form of  maintenance to return facilities to a usable condition.

Continued deferment of  a BMAR project tends to cause the project to become more expensive when actually completed. For example, deferring maintenance means that facilities deteriorate to an extent requiring more costly  repairs  or replacement.  In  addition,  the deferment of utility-type projects may result in payment of extremely high costs due to violations of  environmental compliance standards.

The President's  FY 1994 budget request for real property maintenance was  $0.833  billion.  At that  level,  less  than  half of the  annual recurring requirements could be funded. Therefore, commanders had to  make hard choices concerning what projects would remain unfunded. The FY  1994 BMAR level  increased approximately 28 percent over the FY  1993  esti› mate. The major FY 1994 BMAR increases were in unaccompanied per› sonnel  housing,  maintenance  shops,  and  utility  systems,  all  with  an adverse  impact  on  readiness,  quality  of life,  soldier  retention,  and  the environment.

FY  1994  marked  the  first  year  of operation  for  the  Office  of the Assistant Chief  of  Staff  for Installation Management (OACSIM). Among

the  OACSIM's most significant  accomplishments  during the fiscal  year was  the  development  and  publication  of the  Installation  Management Action  Plan  (IMAP).  The  IMAP  is  the  Anny  guidance  to  implement installation management strategy goals published in  the OACSIM pam› phletlnstallations: A Strate&amp;ry.for the 21st Century. The IMAP reflects the Army's Long-Range Planning Guidance, the Army Plan, and the installa› tion strategy. The IMAP provides impetus to existing installation planning initiatives and is not intended to supplant long-range planning. The actions listed in the plan are recommended starting points for development of  an IMAP tailored to installation needs.

The JllvlAP  was developed in response to field requests for guidance to achieve eight goals that were identified by a Headquarters, Department of the Army, process action team. These goals  included reshaping instal› lations  to  meet  power-projection specifications;  formulating  soldier and civilian employee programs to enhance the quality of life; improving the living  and  working  environment  for  soldiers,  families,  and  civilians; achieving total  integration of  environmental stewardship into installation operations; establishing and funding an investment plan for installations to revitalize  or  replace  infrastructure  facilities; completing  a  functional installation-level  redesign that will  offset the  impact of downsizing and continuing resource constraints by  improving service and reducing costs of running  installations;  forming  community,  interservice,  and  inter› agency partnerships for faciUties and services to improve operations, cus› tomer service, and fiscal effectiveness and efficiency; attaining resource management flexibility for the garrison commander through policies, pro› cedures, and systems that will enable installations to  operate as business activities and maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of  resources; and transforming the Army's human resources programs to build a participa› tive,  committed,  installation  management team  capable  of meeting  the uncertainties  and  technological  complexities  of a  constantly  changing envirorunent.

Other significant OACSIM accomplishments during FY 1994 includ› ed the development, staffing, and publishing of  FM 100- 22, Installation Management. FM 100- 22 outlined the  functions  and  responsibilities  of installation  and  garrison  commanders. The OACSIM  also reformed  the garrison  commander  selection  process.  Beginning  with  the  command selection boards held from December 1993 to January 1994, 0 - 5 and 0 - 6 garrison  commanders  were  centrally  selected  by  a  Department  of the Army Command Selection Board. In addition, the Garrison Commander Pre··Conunand Course was developed to provide new  garrison comn1an› ders  instruction  in dealing with  the  political, social, and economic com› plexities of  running and managing installations. The first class graduated on 3 August 1994.

During FY 1994 the OACSIM received approval from the CSA for implementation  of Part  I, Infrastructure,  of  the  Installation  Status Report  (ISR).  The  ISR  is  a  three-part  automated  reporting  system designed to provide commanders and the Army Staffwith an assessment of the  quantity,  quality,  and  costs of installation facilities,  natural  and man-made environments, and services.  Part II, Environment, and Part III, Services, were set for future development. The OACSIM also sup› ported the fielding of  eight Installation Support Module (ISM) applica› tions  to  twenty-four  installations  in  FY  1994.  The  ISM  program  is designed  to  increase  efficiency  at  the  installation  level  through  the automation  of day-to-day  information processing.  The  eight  applica› tions fielded were: Personnel  Locator;  Education  Management Information System; In-Processing; Out-Processing; Drug and Alcohol Management  Information  System;  Master  Schedule  of  Activities; Transition Processing; and Transition Orders.

As part of  the Whole Barracks Renewal Program, the OACSIM on 2 February 1994 received the CSA's approval of  the "1 + 1" standard for bar› racks design. The new standard incorporates quality-of-life enhancements to  make  barracks more like a home to single soldiers. The "1 + 1" design provides two private rooms with walk-in closets for living and sleeping; a service  area equipped  with  counter,  sink,  refrigerator,  and  space  for  a microwave oven; and a batlu·oom  shared by no more than two soldiers. The first project using this design was initiated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in  May 1994.

During FY 1994 the OACSIM produced several publications to assist Army  housing  occupants.  Department  of  the  Army  Pamphlet  210-8, Housing  Utilization  Management, provided  management  tips  and  tech› niques to improve the availability of  on-post housing for occupancy by sol› diers and their families,  thereby reducing costs and waiting times for fami› lies to move in. The "Housing Relocation Assistance Program User's  Guide" provided information on the availability of on- and off-post housing to sol› diers  relocating  due  to  permanent change of station. The Interior Design Manual.for Single Soldier Housing was published to establish consistency in the quality, design, and furnishings for unaccompanied-personnel housing.

Finally, the OACSIM introduced Bridging the Gap, an Operations and Maintenance, Army, program to place needed emphasis on barracks main·· tenance and repair. The program provides interim maintenance and repair pending renovation of  barracks or replacement under the Whole Barracks Renewal  program. Health,  safety,  and "worst first"  projects were given priority;  next  were  projects  repairing  major components  (such as  heat, ventilation, air conditioning, roof, latrine, laundry,  or utilities distribution systems) or showing potential energy savings. (See also previous discus› sions on the subject in the Army Housing section.)

During the fiscal year three  major issues plagued the OACSIM and the  Army's installation  community.  First,  a  shortage  in  Army  Family Housing funds resulted in the closing of  housing units. Second, shortfalls in  funding  base operations (BASOPS) requirements resulted  in  the con› tinued deterioration of  infrastructure and the shift in funding from opera› tions  tempo to BASOPS areas. Third, with  a 40 percent reduction in  the Army  budget,  quality-of-life  initiatives suffered as the  Army  worked  to meet critical readiness objectives.

During FY 1994 the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Logistics,  and Environment) (OASA-ILE) provided exten› sive appraisal and real estate acquisition support for fast-track,  high-pro› file  military projects that included development of the Engineer Proving Ground, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Training Center in Southbridge, Massachusetts, the National Museum of the U.S. Army, the Yakima Firing Center, and expansions at the National Training Center. The OASA-JLE provided oversight of  an extensive study to improve execution of  real estate actions for the U.S. Army Reserve; made the first two con› veyances of  base closure properly (Fort Ord) under the Pryor Amendment legislation  that  governs  the  disposal  of base  closure  properly;  granted interim leases for portions of  closed bases at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, and  Lexington-Bluegrass  Army  Depot,  Kentucky;  disposed  of sixteen housing sites, receiving more than  $9 million for the Army base realign› ment and closure account; institutionalized the Army Corps of  Engineers (US  ACE) Contingency Real Estate Support Team (CREST) in Army doc› trine and with  major commands (MACOMs); deployed  USACE CREST members to Korea in response to a request from the Commander in Chief, Pacific, to  support contingency operations; and initiated suit against the State of  Hawaii for tax discrimination against property leased to the Army. The settlement of the suit resulted  in the government's recovery of more than $1  million plus interest.

An Army National Guard concern in FY 1994 was the stagnation of funding  for Real  Property  Maintenance Activities  (RPMA).  Aging  and inadequate  facilities inhibit training, performance,  and  productivity. Adequate facilities are required for training and mobilization. Limitations on  the types of MILCON projects that can be approved severely reduced the  Guard's flexibility  to  fund  critical  and  high-priority  projects.  The Army National Guard operated more than 3,000 owned armories and 90 leased ones at 2,700 locations in more than 2,400 communities in all fifty states,  Puerto Rico, the  Virgin Islands, Guam,  and the District  of Columbia.  In  addition,  the  Guard  supported  the  operation  and  mainte› nance of21,477 training, aviation, and logistical facilities on 3,393  instal› lations  in 2,670  communities.  Overall, RPMA funded  58  percent of the Guard's total  requirements. There  were  insufficient operational  funds  to

maintain and operate the  Guard's major training areas  during  the fiscal year. This level of funding will force  the deferral of facility  maintenance and  repair,  thus  increasing  expenditures  and accelerating  the  closure  of necessary facilities because they no longer meet environmental and safe› ty requirements.

In FY 1994 the Guard received $153.6 million for real property oper› ations and maintenance, three percent less than in FY 1993. The federally supported square footage grew, however, from 55.1  to 55.2 million square feet.  In FY 1988 $3.41  per square foot was available to operate and main› tain  Army  National  Guard  facilities.  ln  FY  1994  the  amount was  only $2.42 per foot, or $2.03 in constant FY 1988 dollars.

The Army Reserve  is  faced  with  integrating the installation's MIL› CON backlog·  with other reserve facility requirements. Funding is insuffi› cient to  meet essential revitalization goals ($63  million  per year)  and  to decrease  the  $2.0  billion  backlog.  In FY  1994  four  active  installations were  transferred  to  the Army Reserve for command and control.  Forces Command provided funding assistance to facilitate the  installation trans› fer.  Additional  transfers  of installations  to  the Army  Reserve,  providing opportunities to  enhance training and mobilization readiness, are  antici› pated. As these transfers occur, funding must be available to continue to revitalize facilities and infrastructure and to respond to new missions. As in the past, a combination of  addition and alteration projects and new con› struction will be used to provide for the Army Reserve's essential mission needs. Almost half of  the Army Reserve facilities in FY 1994 were inad› equate in meeting training, storage, and maintenance needs.

## Legacy Program

ln FY  1994 the Army received $16,932,000 from the Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program. The service distributed this money to 222 natural and cultural resources projects.

## Special Functions

## Environmental Protection

To meet its environmental responsibilities in FY 1994, the Army spem $1.7 billion, a sum equal to 53  percent of  the amolmt the service spent on operational  tempo.  Guided  by  an  environmental  strategy  emphasizing compliance, restoration, prevention, and conservation, the Army contin› ued to make progress in the protection and preservation of  natural and cul› tural resources during the fiscal year. The $1.7 billion expended included funding for regulatory compliance, land restoration, pollution prevention, resource conservation, and development of new technologies.

Environmental  compliance  relics  on  conformance  to  federal,  state, and  host  nation  environmental  standards  at  Army  installations  world› wide.  Compliance covers the operation of utility plants, industrial facili› ties such as ammunition plants and depots, and ranges that support train› ing,  and  the  construction, maintenance, and repair of a  wide variety of other  facilities.  In  FY  1994  compliance  cost  the  Army  $50  l  million. Consideration  of environmental  impacts  and conformance  to  environ› mental  standards  are  essential to all Army  operations.  Exponential growth in increasingly complex federal and state environmental laws and regulations  has  made this  mission  more challenging. The cost for com› pliance activities at DOD installations in foreign countries is expected to increase  as  environmental  requirements  are  identified  to  comply  with applicable baseline guidance or Final Governing Standards developed for designated  host  nations.  The  Final  Governing  Standards,  specific  for each country, establish a consistent set of  environmental standards for all DOD components in the country.

The  Army  spent $731  million  for  environmental  cleanup  at Army installations in FY 1994. Remedial actions were taken at 364 sites, includ› ing the continuance of some pre-1994 actions. Actions were complete at 236 sites and under way  at 128 sites. No further action was  required at 4,523 sites. Studies were under way to  investigate possible contamination at 4,390 sites. As the  DOD  executive agent for Formerly Used Defense

Sites,  the  Army  spent $333  million  in  FY  1994,  with  remedial  actions completed at 230 sites and under way at 270 properties. No further action was required at 4,509 properties.

The Army allocated about $62 million to pollution prevention during the fiscal year. The Army  promotes pollution prevention as  a good busi› ness  practice,  minimizing the  risks  of contamination from  hazardous  or toxic  substances and  the  costs of associated mitigation  and  compliance. The Army is implementing Executive Order 12856, which mandates a 50 percent reduction of  hazardous wastes by the end of 1999. Pollution pre› vention  plans must be developed  to  specify  how  installations wi 11  meet Army reduction goals. Additionally, the executive order requires that mil› itary specifications and standards be reviewed and revised to eliminate or reduce toxic and hazardous materials.

Conservation is focused on maximizing the use of  Army land for mis› sion-essential activities through wise planning for  and  protection of  eco› logical and cultural resources. The Army is committed to  ensuring water quality and soil stabilization and sustaining biodiversity.  Responsible for the management of  approximately twelve million acres of land, the Army is  balancing  necessary  but  inherently  destructive  training  and  mission activities with the conservation of  natural and cultural resources. This bal› ance is complicated by greater troop density at installations in  the United States, a  greater demand for training  land for modern weapon systems, and the austerity of  fiscal resources. In response to national initiatives and public awareness of the environment's importance, the Army is develop› ing policies for land management, timber production, and agricultural out› leasing and grazing. The new direction emphasizes ecosystem and biodi› versity management rather than production and revenues.  FY  1994 fund› ing for conservation totaled $40 million.

The Army Environmental Quality Technology Program supports the four environmental initiatives by identifying, developing, and demonstrat› ing innovative technologies.  In  FY  1994 the Army fielded new technolo› gies to support environmental programs in a cost-effective and technical› ly sound  manner; coordinated  with  other  DOD  components,  the Environmental  Protection  Agency,  and  the  Department  of Energy  to develop and share environmental technologies; and provided $94 million for enviromnental research and development projects.

The reserve components'  leading environmental expenses are for com› pliance and restoration.  Hazardous waste  remains a significant problem, though most sites have had initial inspections and many cleanup programs have begun. Funding shortfalls existed throughout the reserve components in FY 1994, with a likelihood that an increasing backlog of  sites requiring remediation  will further inhibit efforts toward compliance and prevention of  pollution and could eventually affect operations and training.

A  summary  of  major  environmental  requirements  affecting  the reserve components in FY 1994 is shown in Table  18.

TABLE 18FY 1994 RI1SERVE COMPONENT ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS

|                              | Army National Guard             | Army Reserve    |

Note: FY94 supplemental amounts arc included in FY95 planned funding.

The Army National Guard Environmental Programs Directorate has succeeded in obtaining additional funding at several federally owned loca› tions for environmental site inspection and remedial investigation projects and for interim underground storage tank removals. The Army National Guard  has  not  been  as  successful  in obtaining dedicated  funds  for  the environmental assessments necessary to determine if  restoration of  feder› ally owned  facilities is required.  The  Comprehensive  Environmental Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability Act (CERCLA)  work  at state› owned  facilities  cannot  be  completed  because  Defense  Environmental Restoration  Account  (DERA)  funds  are  not  available  for  state-owned facilities  and operation and maintenance funds cannot be used in lieu of DERA funds. This problem will continue until other federal or state funds are made available for CERCLA work at state-owned facilities.  Funding for  underground storage tank  remediation  in FY  1994 was  sufficient to fund  all  remediation  requirements;  however,  as  the  1998  deadline  to replace single-wall underground storage tanks approaches and more tank removals reveal contaminated sites, a funding shortfall will likely exist for the cleanup of these sites. In meeting policy requirements, the  burden of paying  for  cleanup  costs  will  be shifted  to  state  budgets,  which  are ill equipped to  fund  additional  requirements.  More and more  sites are not being  remediated  in  a  timely  fashion  due  to  insufficient  funding  and increased regulation.

The Army National  Guard  awarded ten contracts for environmental engineering and  technical support in FY  1994. The award of these con› tracts represented a break in the Guard's reliance on agencies such as the Department of Energy and  the Army  Corps of Engineers that provided

expensive environmental services. These awards marked the culmination ofyears of  technical and acquisition planning and were made possible by approval from the Secretary of  the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition, for waiver of certain federal acquisition regulation require› ments. With these contracts the contract capacity over the next five years will exceed $520 million for a broad range of  environmental assessments and impact statements, studies of pollution prevention and spill prevention programs, and environmental assessments for aircraft conversions.

In FY 1994 the Anny National Guard had two pending fines totaling $295,000  for Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)  viola› tions at Camp Dodge, Iowa. These fines remained under legal review over the question of  the federal versus state status of the facilities. A $52,000 fine for RCRA violations at Rochester, New  York, was dismissed after the Guard agreed to sign a federal compliance agreement. All other violations were  resolved  through  agreement  with  state  and  federal  regulators.  A $119,000  fine  for RCRA violations at State Area Command- Tennessee was suspended. Notices ofViolation (NOVs) were issued for $250,000 for Clean  Water  Act (CWA) violations at wastewater treatment  plants at Camp Santiago and Fort Allen, Puerto Rico. This fine remained under negotia› tion based on the compliance efforts of  Puerto Rico. As the federal gov› ernment did not waive sovereign immunity under the CWA,  any Hability will likely be a state responsibility.

Army Reserve environmental cleanup efforts  are improving despite discoveries of  new contamination projects not meeting Class I criteria and increasing  regulatory  requirements.  The  Army  Reserve  received  four NOVs during FY 1994 for relatively minor violations. They were either resolved or allowed to continue under a negotiated compliance timetable. There were 15 reported spills of  hazardous waste ranging from 3 quarts to 70 gallons. All of  the  16 total NOVs issued to the Army Reserve during FY 1993 and FY 1994 were resolved.

During FY 1994 DOD environmental training program requirements, including  those  developed  by  reserve  components,  increased.  This increase had three causes. First,  there was an increased number of  posi› tions requiring individuals in trained specialties. Second, there was a high turnover  rate  as  qualified  people  left  for  higher  paying  environmental positions outside DOD. Third, environmental laws and regulations grew in number and complexity.

The Army  National  Guard  environmental  training  program  in FY 1994 was composed of training required by statute, basic and advanced professional  training,  and  awareness  training.  The  training  required  by statute is primarily from congressional mandates and is accomplished by workshops  and on the job.  Basic and advanced professional training is provided through formal classroom training that relies primarily on inter-

nal resources but with some contracting. Awareness training is provided with internal resources to a broad segment of  Army National Guard per› sonnel. Workshops of three to seven days were conducted in the areas of hazardous  waste  management,  training  area  management,  automated environmental reports, and environmental program management. Formal classroom training was provided in the areas of ·the National Environmental  Policy  Act,  the  Environmental  Compliance  Assessment System, Wetlands Identification and Delineation, Environmental Communications,  and  Basic  Environmental  Staff Training.  Awareness training was also provided.

Limited  funding  affected  the  Army National  Guard  environmental training program during the fiscal  year, placing limits on class size and severely  limiting  nonessential environmental  training.  The  Army National Guard environmental training program goal is to meet all pro› fessional requirements for full-time professional environmental staff and to  be the primary resource for Army National Guard awareness training and materials. The Army National Guard continued pursuing its initiative to develop  an  environmental  training  cell at the National  Guard Professional Education Center,  Camp Robinson, Arkansas. The mission of this  training  cell  will  be  to  conduct  environmental  awareness  for National Guard personnel attending training courses at the Professional Training  Center,  to  conduct  or  coordinate  all  environmental  training requirements for state and National Guard Bureau staff, to conduct envi› ronmental  training  in  the  states  via  the  Professional  Education  Center Mobile Training Team, and to develop and produce environmental train› ing tapes for distribution to states.

The Army  Reserve  environmental  training  is  managed by  the  U.S. Army  Reserve  Command.  During  FY  1994  mandatory  environmental training for hazardous material handlers was expanded to include drivers and all other personnel involved in this area. Certification is received fol› lowing  training  provided  by  federal  and  state  agencies.  Army  Reserve members  participate  in  the  Army  Environmental  Training  Integration Steering  Committee  meetings  that  focus  on a  complete  overhaul  of the standard training given for military occupational specialty and leadership. The  goal  of the  steering committee  meetings  is  to  identify the  specific environmental training required by each specialty.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

As it had in the past, the Army continued to support small and small disadvantaged business throughout America in FY 1994. Notwithstanding reduced  obligations  for  equipment,  supplies,  and  services,  the  Army exceeded its goals for contracts awarded to small and small disadvantaged

136

businesses.  Through  programs such  as  Increasing Manufacturing Procurement  Above  Current  Totals  and  the  Enhanced  Subcontracting Program, the Army strove to overcome barriers to maximize opportunities for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses.

## Legal  Affairs

During FY 1994 Army-wide court-martial rates showed a decrease of 5 percent from FY 1993. General courts-martial decreased by 7.9 percent, bad-conduct discharge (BCD) special courts-martial increased by 5.5 per› cent,  special  courts-martial  decreased  by  28.9  percent,  and  summary courts-martial  decreased by  4.1  percent. The  overall  conviction rate  for FY 1994 increased slightly to 91  percent from 89 percent in FY 1993. A comparison of  general, BCD special, special, and summary courts-martial for FY 1993 and FY 1994 is outlined in Table  19.

TABLE  19-COMPARISON OF COURTS-MARTIAL FOR FY 1993 AND FY 1994

|                 | FY1993                            | FY 1994   |

The Office of The Judge Advocate  General  (OTJAG)  continued to serve as the Army representative to the Joint Service Committee (JSC) on Military Justice. The JSC conducted an annual review of the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), as required by Executive Order 12473 and DOD Directive 5500.17. The JSC also proposed and evaluated amendments to the Uniform Code of  Military Justice (UCMJ) and the MCM, while serv› ing as a forum for exchanging military justice information.

Revisions in the UCMJ resulted from promulgation of Change 7 by the  President,  as  Executive  Order  12936,  effective  9  December  1994. Change 7 highlights include a substantial increase in permissible punish› ments  for homicides  and  sex offenses and a  revision of the  sentencing rules relating to evidence of rehabilitative potential. AR 27- 10, Military Justice, was  also  revised.  Effective  8 August  1994,  the  revision  imple› mented changes to the MCM and modified procedures for implementing the Victim's  Rights and Restitution Act of 1990.

The U.S Army Trial Judiciary in FY 1994 saw a slight increase in the number of trials by court-martial, which rose from  1,293 in FY 1993 to

1,335  in  FY  1994.  The  Contract Appeals  Division continued  to  direct Army contractual bid protests filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO) as well as those filed with the General Services Board of  Contract Appeals (GSBCA). In FY 1994 there were 219 GAO and 13 GSBCA bid protests filed. The Intellectual Property Law Division continued to serv~ as  the Army's policy  and oversight organizatiqn to  monitor intellectual property law activities, which include patent and trademark prosecution, patent secrecy, technology transfer, and copyrights.

Concerned  about  world  competition,  Congress  passed  the  1980. Stevenson-WydlerTechnology Innovation Act (SWTIA), making the transfer of  federal technology a national priority. SWTIA was amended by the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act,  which  authorized  federal  laboratories to enter  into  cooperative  research  and  development  agreements  (CRADAs). with nonfederal parties. Previously, procurement regulations restricted feder› al  government scientists  from  working with nonfederal parties to develop commercial  applications  for  Army  technology.  Since  1986  collaboration through CRADAs with nonfederal parties has  increased substantially and rapidly to the benefit of  both the U.S. public and the Army. In addition, there has been an increase in the number of  patent license agreements (PLAs) that license Army technology to nonfederal parties and thus generate royalties for both Army inventors and Army laboratories. In FY 1994 the Army entered into 167 CRADAs with nonfederal parties and 12 PLAs. Royalty income dis› tributed to inventors and laboratories amounted to $81,300 for the fiscal year.

During  the  fiscal  year,  fifte. en patent and  copyright  suits  involving Army initiatives were pending in the Court of  Federal Claims, with poten› tial liability exceeding $400 million. Also, fifteen administrative claims of patent and copyright infringement were pending with potential liability of more than $50 million.

The Army Procurement Fraud Division resolved 731 cases during FY 1994, ending the fiscal year with 695 cases pending. The number of  con› tractor suspension and debarment cases was lower than the previous two years, a trend consistent with decreases in the number of  contractor indict› ments and convictions over the same period.

The Army resolved a record contract fraud case during the fiscal year. On 30 March the service reached a settlement in a whistleblower suit with United  Technologies  Corporation  (Sikorsky  Aircraft  Division)  that required United Technologies Corporation to pay the Army $150 million, the largest sum ever recovered in a whistleblower case and for an Army contract fraud case. More than $132 million of  the recovery derived from false  claims on  Army contracts. The Army suffered damage when United Technologies Corporation overstated charges on work progress payment requests.  The  majority  of contracts  in  the  suit  involved  UH-60  Black Hawk and SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters.

The United Technologies Corporation settlement accounted for a sub› stantial portion of  the $202.4 million total recovered by the Army for pro› curement fraud in FY 1994. This sum also ranked as the highest monetary recovery ever for the Army Procurement Fraud Division in a fiscal year.

The U.S. Army Claims Service settled 79,452 personnel claims with payments totaling $87,069,681  in FY 1994. These claims reimbursed sol› diers  and Army  civilians  for  loss  or damage  to  their personal  property incident to service.

The Tort Claims Division of  the U.S. Army Claims Service continued to  investigate, process, and  administratively settle tort claims arising out of  DOD, U.S. Army, and Army National Guard activities. During the fis› cal  year,  more  than  8,500 tort  claims were filed  against the Army,  with total settlement payments exceeding $37 million.

## Inspector General Activities

The  Department  of the  Army  Inspector  General  (DAJG)  handled 2,303 Inspector General Actions Requests (lGARs) in FY 1994. Of  those, 608 were requests for assistance and 1,695 were allegations. Of the alle› gations  received,  the  Inspector  General  substantiated  243  (14  percent); 1,070 were nonsubstantiated (63  percent); and 382 were neither substan› tiated nor nonsubstantiated (23 percent). Of  the total FY 1994 I  GARs, 43 were DOD Inspector General whistleblower cases. Twenty-five percent of the total IGAR cases were referred by  the active Army; 53  percent were from  unknown  sources;  14  percent  were  from  civilians;  and  8  percent were from the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. The Inspector General also handled 803  hotline  requests during the  fiscal year.  There were six major functional categories ofiGARs for FY 1994. The first cat› egory, personal conduct, included harassment, racial discrimination, and nonsupport of family.  Thirty-three percent (759) of the total  I  GARs fell into  this  category.  The second·  category,  command  and management of organizations, included caring for soldiers and family  members, storing and shipping personal property, exercising command influence, and other command-related functions.  Fourteen  percent (330)  of the  total  !GARs fell  into this category. The third category, military personnel management, involved recruiting operations, reassignments, evaluation reports, promo› tions,  personnel  separations,  awards  and  decorations,  and  other similar actions.  Fourteen percent (326) of  the total I  GARs fell into this category. The fourth  category,  civilian  personnel  management,  included  manage› ment-employee  relations,  recruitment  and  placement,  promotions,  and awards. Nine percent (210) of  the total !GARs fell into this category. The fifth category,  conunanders'  actions  and  decisions,  included  soldier details and  duty rosters,  the weight control program, and  mental evalua-

tions.  Six percent (  143)  of the  total  I  GARs  fell  into  this  category.  The sixth category, finance and accounting, included pay and allowances and finance services. Another 6 percent (143) of  the total !GARs fell into this category.

The DAIG conducted systemic assessments  and  inspections  over a broad  spectrum  of force  readiness  and  resource  management  issues in training,  personnel,  supply,  maintenance,  installations,  and  acquisition during FY 1994. The DAIG also remained responsive to concerns raised by the Army  Secretariat and  Army  Staff in other areas,  such  as  soldier quality of life  and  command stewardship.  Major inspection and  assess› ment efforts in FY 1994 included:

- 1.  Active component training (1993- 1995)
- 2. Reserve component training (1992- 1994)
- 3. Army war reserve materiel (  1993- 1994)
- 4.  Command and control of  small  units (1994)
- 5.  Enlisted Reassignment System (1993- 1994)
- 6.  Military department allegations of discrimination by military personnel (I 993)
- 7.  Small-arms repair parts ( 1994)
- 8.  Armed forces recreation center oversight (1994)
- 9.  Reserve Components Automation System (1994)
- 10. Requirements generation process ( 1994)
- 11.  Support for U.S. Army forces in  United Nations peacekeeping operations (1994)
- 12. Army RETROEUR maintenance program (1994-1995)
- 13. Modeling and simulations (1994 and beyond)
- 14. Nttmerous technical inspections (1994)

The  DATG  investigates  allegations  against  general  officers,  senior executive service employees, inspectors general, and ofTicials in high-vis› ibility positions. During FY  1994 the DAIG conducted 27 formal investi› gations and  more than  140  preliminary  inquiries.  Of the allegations for› mally  invesligated,  approximately  30  percent  were  substantiated.  The most frequently investigated allegations were personal misconduct, abuse of authority, misuse of  funds,  misuse of personnel or property,  misuse of aircraft, and sexual harassment.

## The Army and  Arms Control

Although the Army does not possess nuclear weapons, it plays a key role  in  the  nation's efforts  to  control  these  and  other  weapons  of mass destruction. The service provides policy analysis and recommended posi› tions  on  all  Presidential  Review  Directives on nonproliferation,  ballistic

missile  defenses,  chemical  and  biological  weapons  anns  control,  and export controls. The Army serves as the DOD executive agent for compli› ance with and implementation of  the Conventional Forces in Europe  Treaty and also supplies soldiers to the On-Site Inspection Agency, which moni› tors arms control treaty compliance. The Army Staff  reviews regional arms control strategies and analyzes U.S.  government positions in many negoti› ating forums, including the Conference on Secw·ity Cooperation in Europe, the Open Skies Consultative Commission, the Preparatory Commission for the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Conference on Disarmament, and the Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty Standing Consultative Commission. With the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missile technol› ogy,  and  advanced  conventional  weapons,  future  arms control  initiatives are likely to be more regional in nature. The Army will continue to play an important role in  these issues as a means of  enhancing national security.

During FY 1994 a major Army arms control challenge entailed the destruction of  U.S. chemical weapons. The service had started destruction operations at Johnston Atoll in the Pacific and will begin operations in FY 1995  at Tooele Army Depot,  Utah. The Army  plans  to  construct  seven other  facilities  in  the  United  States  to  destroy  U.S.  chemical  weapons stocks. In parallel with its ongoing destruction program, the Army initiat› ed research and development of  two neutralization-based alternatives for destruction  of chemical  weapons  stocks  at  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground (APG), Maryland,  and Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Indiana. The Army will  continue  to  train  disposal  facility  operators  at the  Chemical Demilitarization Training Facility atAbcrdeen Proving Ground. The Army is  also studying how to identify, recover, and safely dispose of nonstock› pile  chemical  materials  such  as  buried  munitions,  production  and  test facilities, and binary weapons.

## World War II Commemoration

The Secretary of  the Army was the executive agent for the DOD com› memoration of World War II. The DOD World War II Commemoration Committee planned,  integrated,  and coordinated programs,  ceremonies, and commemorative materials. The committee also developed education› al and support materials, public service announcements, lesson plans, and teachers' guides.  In  1994  the  committee  commemorated  landings  on Tarawa,  Kwajalein, Guam,  and  Peleiu.  The President participated in  the commemoration of  the Operation OVE RLORD landings in Normandy. Also commemorated were the liberation of southern France and the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne. Through its participation in these and other small› er commemorative events, the Army honored its former soldiers and com› rades in the other services.

## Conclusion

The Army accomplished much during the fiscal year. Whether facili› tating  the  delivery  of relief  supplies  to  Rwandan  refugees  in Zaire, upholding democracy in Haiti, deterring aggression in Kuwait and Korea, assisting earthquake victims in Calif ornia, fighting fires  in  the American West, or assisting flood victims in  Georgia and Texas,  the Army met its commitments in serving the nation at home and abroad. At home, approx› imately 4,100 active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve personnel responded  to  domestic  emergencies  during  the  year.  The  number  of deployments abroad, meanwhile, escalated threefold  after the end of the Cold War. Soldiers and units making repeated deployments faced a multi› tude of  risks in carrying out combat operations and operations other than war.  In Somalia, for example, eighteen Army soldiers serving in support of Operation SuPPORT HOPE paid the ultimate price for their service as a result of a firefight between U.S. soldiers and forces of Somalia warlord General Mohammed Farah Aideed.

Facing an array  of domestic and foreign  commitments proved espe› cially challenging as tight fiscal constraints continued a downward trend that began in FY 1986. The Army's  Total Obligation Authority request for FY 1994 represented a $3.1  billion decrease, or a decline of over 6 per› cent,  from  FY  1993  levels.  Operating with fewer dollars,  Army  leaders made difficult choices in allocating their financial resources. Planned per› sonnel cuts were accelerated to preserve crucial modernization programs. Active Army end strength was reduced to  540,000 soldiers by the end of FY 1994, as compared with the revised FY 1993 end strength of  575,000. While  this  smaller force  was  stretched  thinner  in  serving  the  nation  at home and abroad, key modernization programs such as  the development of  the RAH- 66 Comanche  helicopter,  the  Advanced  Field  Artillery System, and the Javelin antitank missile system remained solvent through the  purchase  of a  limited  number  of new  weapons.  For  example,  the Javelin  missile  system was funded only to  begin low-rate initial  produc› tion during the fiscal year. Resource constraints also slowed moderniza› tion  by deferring procurement of  modern replacement systems. Deferred procurement increased operation and maintenance expenses, particularly

in  aging  equipment.  Slower  modernization  also  adversely  affected  the issue of  modern equipment to the National Guard and Army Reserve, pro› longing an existing problem of  force incompatibility.

The  steep decline  in resources,  coupled with  funding  unanticipated contingency operations, reduced the Army's  readiness. Although Congress did approve a supplemental appropriation to offset these added costs, the contingency  costs  exceeded  the  supplemental  funding.  In addition,  the President provided Foreign Assistance Act aid  that required the Army to provide equipment and services out of  existing resources to participating foreign nations. To offset these unforeseen costs, the Army withheld $140 million  from  major Army  commands.  This  action  caused  funds  to  be diverted  from  training  and  quality-of-life  programs,  directly  affecting readiness. The scope of  unit training was reduced or canceled, and the pur› chase of  all but essential repair parts was severely curtailed. Quality of lif t~ was  undermined when real property  maintenance was deferred  to  fund civilian salaries and  other nondiscretionary costs, such as transportation and supplies.

The Army made substantive progress in restructuring itself to  better meet  the  challenges  of the  post-Cold  War  era.  The  forward-positioned Cold War force of  eighteen active divisions in FY 1989 had transformed to a power-projection force of  twelve divisions based largely in the United States by the end ofFY 1994. The service reached an important milestone in  forging  a  new  partnership  with  the  reserve  components. The  active Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve moved closer than ever before toward developing a seamless total force. The reserve components' role in the Contingency Force Pool, high-priority units to support eight and two› thirds Army divisions in the event of  a national emergency, demonstrated that the Army placed a high premium on reserve component readiness and the maintenance of balanced resource levels in the Army's new  partner› ship. The Army also sought to eliminate unnecessary obstacles to service. Following guidance from the Secretary of  Defense to the services to opel\ more specialties and assignment opportunities to  women, the Army sig· nificantly expanded opportunities for women. By the end of  the fiscal year women composed 13 percent of  the active Army, as compared to  12.5 per› cent at the start of  the fiscal year. By the end of  the fiscal year, 91  percent of  the Army's  career fields and 67 percent of  Army positions were open to women.

Looking to  the  future,  the Army  embarked on a dynamic new con› ceptual course to reshape itself into  a smaller, more  lethal,  information› age,  capabilities-based  force  for  the  twenty-first  century  called  Force XXI. The Army set the stage for the  creation of Force XXI through  the establishment of the Army Digitization Office to  oversee and  coordinate the integration of  battlefield digitization activities throughout the Army. In

conducting the Advanced Warfighting Experiment DESERT HAMMER VI at the National Training Center, the first test of  digital command and control systems in a field environment, the Army demonstrated that the applica› tion  of  digital technology  to  U.S. combat  forces  could  significantly improve their effectiveness. The  experiment linked a  digitally equipped heavy task force to a brigade.

In the transformation from a forward-deployed, threat-based force to a capabilities-based force,  operating largely from  the continental United States, the Army's revised modernization concepts no longer focused on systems but on capabilities. The Army improved its sustainment capabili› ties  by  joining with  its  sister services  in  formulating  strategic  mobility programs vital to the nation in the post-Cold War era. In accordance with the congressionally mandated 1992 Mobility Requirements Study, which recommended that the Army place an armored brigade afloat, the Army established an interim Army Pre-positioned Afloat package to respond to major  regional  contingencies.  This  package,  pre-positioned  on  twelve ships, consisted of an armor brigade set of  equipment.  Corps- and divi› sion-level  combat support and combat service support units  and fifteen days  of supply  were  also  pre-positioned. These measures  demonstrated that  the  Army  was  on  the  right  path  to  achieving  greater  flexibility  in meeting regional contingencies. However, additional ships that would not be available until FY 1995 were still needed to complete the contingency corps's supply package.

The changing role of  Army installations in the post- Cold War era rep› resented a  substantial shift from the past.  Installation readiness  took  on increased importance as Army installations became power projection plat› forms  from which  forces  are  launched  and  supported  in  the  field. To enhance installations as power projection platforms, the Army invested in munerous  improvements,  including  rail  and  airfield  upgrades  and improved warehousing capabilities. For example, the Army's purchase of 187 railcars for  pre-positioning at key installations for rapid deployment was only an installment of  a planned procurement of 1,630 railcars by FY 2001. At the same time, however, repeated underfunding on base opera› tions presented installation commanders with difficult choices in having to divert funds from operational tempo to pay for essential services.

The Army's commitment to  environmental  stewardship  remained  a top priority. The service continued this commitment through a strategy of compliance,  restoration,  prevention,  and  conservation.  The Army  spent close to two  billion dollars on the environment. This amoW1t represented approximately half  of the amount spent on operational tempo during the fiscal year.

The Army  also  made  significant  progress  in finance  and  business reform.  In  transforming  its  financial  management  to  conform  with the

144

Chief Financial  Officers Act of 1990, the Army broke new  ground with initiatives that revised physical inventory policy, valuation of  assets,  iden› tification of outcome-oriented performance  measures,  and management control.  In  implementing  the  initiatives  of the  National  Performance Review,  the Army  cut  red  tape  by  waiving  restrictive  regulations  that impeded good business practices. The Army improved research, develop› ment,  and  acquisition  methods and  turned  to  a  greater reliance on pur› chasing nondevelopmental, off the shelf, items.

By the end of 1994 the Army was well on its way in evolving from a threat-based  Cold  War  force  into  a  power  projection,  information-age, capabilities-based force.  Serving the nation in a climate of  reduced bud› gets,  continued downsizing, and increasingly varied obligations and mis› sions  presented  the Army  with  a  number  of complications.  Readiness, modernization, quality-of-life programs, vehicle and equipment mainte› nance, and real property maintenance were all adversely affected as Army leaders made difficult choices in responding to the nation's  needs at home and abroad.  Looking toward  the  future,  the  promise of digiti:Gation  and Force XXI provided a valuable frame of  reference for how the Army of  the post-Cold War era would modernize and appear in the twenty-first centu› ry.  Force XXI also signaled that a dramatic break in  how the Army oper› ates as a fighting force may be on the horizon.  In addition, by the end of the  fiscal  year it  was  also  clear  that  a  major  demographic  change  was occurring in the Army. There was no doubt that the Army would be com› posed of  greater numbers of  women than ever before.
