## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1998

## Introduction

In late 1997, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein precipitated a series of  crises threatening the settlement of the  1991  Persian Gulf War.  In particular,  Iraqi forces  violated no-fly zones established by  the truce and  intetfered with the United Nations weapons inspection teams  tasked with neutralizing the Iraqi weapons of  mass destruction programs. In response, the commander-in-chief  of the U.S. Central Command moved to increase U.S. and allied forces in the area. More than thirty-five thousand U.S.  military personnel, in addition to coalition forces,  deployed to  the  Gulf,  including a  substantial  ground  component.  In suppmt of this multiservice, multinational force,  Coalition/Joint Task Force› Kuwait (C/JTF-KU) was established in 1998 under the Third U.S. Army and the  U.S.  Army  Forces  Central  Command  (ARCENT).  Although  ARCENT headquarters were located at Fort McPherson, Georgia, the command already had a considerable forward presence at Camp Doha, Kuwait.

The C/JTF-KU involved forces and force pledges from eleven nations: the British Commonwealth powers of  Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the  United  Kingdom;  Argentina,  the  Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  Poland, and  Romania, along with the host nation,  Kuwait;  and  U.S. Army,  Navy, Air Force, and  Marine forces.  U.S.  soldiers and marines,  however,  formed the  nucleus  of the  ground  force  with  more  than  seven  thousand  rapidly deploying into the theater in February 1998. The emphasis was on rapidity; in less than fifteen hours after landing in Kuwait, soldiers of  the 3d Infantry Division  (Mechanized)  drew  pre-positioned  equipment  and  established their battle  positions  in  the desert. They had  been ordered from  their base at  Fort  Stewart,  Georgia,  less  than  ninety-six  hours  earlier.  Despite  this demanding timetable,  1st Brigade (-),the division ready brigade engaged in  this  deployment,  reported as  fully  mission capable  99.7  percent of the seventeen  hundred  vehicles  they  drew  from  Camp  Doha.  These  vehicles included Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and M 109 self-propelled 155-mm howitzers, as well as the numerous other vehicles needed to support and sustain a modern heavy brigade.

The brigade deployed under air defense cover provided by the 32d Army Air and  Missile  Defense  Command,  which  controlled  all  Patriot  units  in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, and successfully integrated new Kuwaiti Patriot batteries into the air defense stmcture. This marked the first time that coalition theater missile defense architecture had been established anywhere. Defense against the potential Iraqi nuclear, biological, and chemical threat

came from  both U.S.  and allied  troops. The  latter included Czechs, Poles, and  Romanians  using  equipment  and  techniques  developed  only  a  few years  earlier  for  potential  use  by  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  against  U.S. forces.  Logistical support for the C/JTF-KU came from a mix of  U.S. Army and  Kuwaiti  government  sources.  In  addition to  the relatively  traditional functions  of marshaling,  sustaining,  and  protecting  a  combat  force,  the complex character of the theater of  operations meant that the Army had  to devote considerable effort to the conduct of  legal, civil, and public affairs in planning its deployment and the possible subsequent military campaign.

This  deployment,  Operation  D eSERT  TIIUNDER, was  in  many  ways thoroughly  characteristic  of the  operational  environment  the  U.S.  Army faced in fiscal year (FY) 1998: a rapid response required to address a sudden threat far  from  home,  using diverse,  far-flung  forces,  and  conducted in  the face of a potential threat from  weapons of mass destruction,  in a complex political environment, under intensive media coverage. The operation was carried out in  the context of  a National  Military Strategy that reflected the fundamental change in the international environment accompanying the end of  the Cold War.

Between the end of World War II and the collapse of Soviet power in 1989, the National Military Strategy was driven by the need for the United States  and  its  allies  to  contain  and  deter  Soviet  expansionism  through forward-based  forces  focused  on  global  operations,  potentially  involving the wholesale use of  nuclear weapons. After 1989, the nation faced a much different, more complex strategic environment. Wars between ethnic factions, the  proliferation  of nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  weapons  and  the ballistic missiles to deliver them, and an i11crease in the scope and frequency of international  terrorism  all  characterized the  new  situation.  As  a  result, the twentieth-century U.S. emphasis on successfully fighting mid- and high› intensity  wars  gave  way  to  ncar-continuous  engagement  in  peacekeeping and  nation-building  work,  among  other  low-intensity  operations.  At  the same time, the requirement to address the previous spectrum of operations remained.

The National Military Strategy in FY 1998 had three main thrusts: (I) shaping the international environment in ways favorable to the United States and its interests, (2) responding effectively to  threats and challenges to U.S. national interests, and (3) anticipating and preparing to meet future threats to the United States. The U.S. Army had a vital role in each of  these aspects of the strategy. The Army shaped the international environment largely through its  various  presence  missions,  whether  in  peacekeeping  operations,  drug interdiction, or international training and military exchanges. FY 1997  had seen a  daily  average  of 31,316 soldiers deployed  in presence missions  in more than one hundred countries. Although the trend was headed downward, in FY 1998 there was a daily average of28,420 soldiers deployed to seventy-

six countries, plus more than 122,000 soldiers and Department of  the Army civilian employees stationed outside the continental United States.

Overseas presence also helped the  Army respond to  threats and challenges to the United States. The National Military Strategy committed the Army, in common with the other U.S.  armed  services, to  plan,  train, and equip  for two nearly simultaneous major theater wars (MTWs). The post- Cold War budgetary  environment,  where  resources  had  been extensively  reallocated after 1989 because of  the absence of  an overarehing Soviet threat, made this a challenging requirement to meet.  By FY  1997, Army  buying power had declined by 39 percent and active-duty strength had slipped by 36 percent. Nearly seven hundred installations had closed. Force structure had decreased from twenty-eight to  eighteen divisions.  Procurement had decreased by  62 percent. At the same time, Army missions had increased by a factor of  sixteen in the current international environment.

This conflict between shrinking resources and expanding commitments, taking  place  in  the  context  of the  two-MTWs  requi1·ement,  shaped  the structure and operation of  the U.S. Army as it entered FY 1998. To reconcile the contradiction, the Army placed a premium on strategic mobility to meet contingencies,  as  shown  in  the  DESERT TIIUNDHR deployment,  which  the Army accomplished through the use of  pre-positioned equipment stocks and elaborate logistical networks. Meeting extensive conunitments with limited resources also demanded the most effective personnel possible in order to accomplish multiple missions under a comparatively low personnel ceiling. As a result, the Army put considerable effort into recruiting the best possible personnel, giving them thorough  and demanding training, and retaining them. But in the  post- Cold War situation,  a  strong civilian economy  competed with  the  Army  for  recruits,  and  operational  commitments  complicated training. The strains of  frequent deployment taxed soldiers and their families, especially in the face of the opportunities presented by a growing civilian labor market demanding workers with the technical and managerial skills imparted  by Army  training.  Responding  to this  complex  set of problems required the Army to improve the quality of  life for its personnel, enhancing aspects of the financial, communal, and physical environments strained by the long drawdown. Doing so forced the service to employ its resources more effectively,  largely  through the use  of technology to realize efficiencies in management, logistics, and training, but also through new human resources initiatives and difficult budget reallocations.

Technology  also  drove  the  Army's activity  in  the  third  thrust  of the National Military Strategy,  preparing to  meet future  threats to the  United States.  A  fundamental  technological  threat  was  internal:  addressing  the "Year 2000" computer issue inherent in many Army systems, as well as those of much of the rest of the world.  Inadequate software held the potential to wreak havoc on I January 2000 as outdated computer systems failed to adjust

properly to  the new elate.  Matters also  pressing for operational forces  were the  evolving  and  increasing  dangers  of nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical weapons  of mass  destruction;  proliferated  ballistic  missile  technologies; and  terrorist attack.  Reorientation  of force  structure,  equipment,  training, and doctrine would be necessary to address effectively these interlinked and complicated threats. Similarly, it would be essential for the Army to address the military aspects of  space, in particular the effects of  space-based systems on the communications and reconnaissance necessary for the Army to use its powerful but scarce forces with maximum effect.

Recognition  of the  importance  of these  phenomena  to  achieving  the Army's battlefield goal  of information dominance also drove much of the service's effort to address  future  conventional-war threats.  The Army,  by necessity  personnel  intensive,  has  traditionally  had  the  smallest  portion (  15  percent in  FY 1997) of the Department of  Defense budget [or research, development, and acquisition. Nonetheless, the service has been developing and  integrating  new  sensors,  computing  equipment,  and  communications networks. These  devices  promised soldiers  and  commanders  at all  levels unparalleled knowledge of their tactical and operational situation, enabling them to employ new precision-guided close combat and deep attack weapons with great effect. These "digitization"  efforts culminated  in  the Advanced Warfightlng  Experiments,  begun  in FY 1997  and  continued  in FY 1998, which decisively demonstrated the power of  the new systems.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organization

The Department of  the Army established a new major command (MACOM) at the beginning of  FY 1998 by reorganizing and upgrading the Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (SSDC) and renaming it the Space and Missile Defense  Command  (SMDC).  As  was  the  SSDC  commander,  the  SMDC commander is also the commander of the U.S. Army Space Command. The creation and organization of  the new MACOM reflect the importance of  space and missile defense to  the Army and to joint forces.  The command ensures that the soldier in the field has access to space assets and their products, and it provides effective missile defense for the nation and deployed forces. The SMDC integrates  space and  missile  defense  equipment  into  the Army  and joint environments, conducts research and development, operates a Battle Lab facility to test equipment and train personnel, and serves as the Army propo› nent in the joint space and missile defense communities.

The SMDC, with headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, consists of five primary components. The SMDC Force Development Integration Center is  located  in  Arlington.  The  U.S.  Army  Space  Command  (Forward)  is in Colorado  Springs,  Colorado.  Space  and  Missile  Defense  Technical Center, Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab, and the Space and Missile Defense Acquisition  Center  (SMDAC)  are  all  in  Huntsville,  Alabama. The SMDAC's Huntsville facilities,  the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensors Project Office, and the Ballistic Missile Targets Joint Project Office are supplemented by  the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility  at White  Sands Missile Range,  New  Mexico;  the U.S. Army  Kwajalein Atoll/Kwajalein Missile  Range  in the  Republic  of the  Marshall Islands; and the Army Space Program Office in Alexandria, Virginia.

The  Army  Materiel  Command  (AMC)  restructured  or  realigned  a number of its  subordinate  commands  and  activities  in  FY  1998.  At  the beginning of  the fiscal year, the AMC consolidated the Aviation and Troop Command  and  the Missile  Command to  form  the  Aviation  and  Missile Command  and  added  the  National  Sustainment  Maintenance Office to  the  Industrial  Operations  Command.  On  15  January  1998,  the AMC

provisionally  organized  the  Soldier and  Biological  Chemical  Command, which  merged  the  Chemical  and  Biological  Defense  Command  and  the Soldier Systems Command.

## Management

The  National  Performance  Review  began  in  March  1993,  with  the goal  of  creating  a  more  effective  and  efficient  federal  government. In conjunction  with  the  Department of Defense  (DOD),  the U.S.  Army  has pursued the goals of  the National Performance Review through its National Partnership for Reinventing Government initiative. To reinvent its business practices, the  DOD designated certain organizations in  which experiments in  business  process  reengineering  from  first  principles"reinvention"› could  be fostered  through  encouragement of prudent risk  taking;  removal of  bureaucratic barriers; and linking of  authority, responsibility, and accountability. Within  the Army,  fotty-seven such activities are designated "reinvention  laboratories."  This number  includes  four  new  reinvention laboratories established in  FY  1998: Dental Command; Test and Evaluation Command; Intelligence and Security Command; and the Medical Command Activity at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The reinvention labs are complemented by higher commands designated as "reinvention centers." Of  the six reinvention centers, two-the U.S. Army Medical Command and the U.S. Army Special Operations Commandwere established in FY 1998.

The commanders of reinvention laboratories and centers are delegated broad powers to establish their own labs, to waive regulations in support of reinvention initiatives,  and  to  coordinate directly  with  the DOD regarding legislative  changes  to  support  reinvention.  During FY  1998,  twenty  new waivers to  DOD and Army policies were approved  for  implementation  by Army  organizations  (thereby  making a  total  of 333  waivers  to  DOD  and Army policies  approved  since  1994). The Army  continues  to  achieve  the President's Best Practice  award  for  approving  reinvention  waivers  within thirty days by authorizing reinvention commanders and directors to locally approve waivers to Army pol icyan  effort  that  has  met  with  sufficient  success to enable the  service to  work with the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) during FY 1998 to design and implement a process for achieving the same goal for DOD regulations. In FY  1998, seven reengineering proposals from  the MACOMs, recngineering centers, and reengineering laboratories passed through the Army StaiT's Reengineering Legislative Working Group, which oversees  the  Reengineering Legislative Change Process. The Army submitted two proposals to the OSD for incorporation in the supplemental FY99  Program  Budget.  A  third  proposal  was  considered  favorably  and fotwarded  for inclusion in OSD working legislation for FYOO  for review by the Office of  Management and Budget.

The Army's  success in its reinvention efforts was recognized with awards in FY 1998. Through the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, the vice president awarded twenty-three Hammer  Awards to Army teams, the winning organizations'  work having saved more than $496 million. The U.S. Army Aviation  and  Missile  Command  received  the  Secretary  of Defense Award for Reengineering Excellence for reengineering and testing the DOD travel system in a manner that meets operational mission needs with better service to the customers and less cost to the government. The DOD selected the Longbow Missile Joint Venture Cost Reduction Program as the industry recipient of  the  1998 Life Cycle Cost Award. This program was considered an outstanding example of  industry and government collaborating to achieve dramatic  savings  without  compromising  product  quality. Fort Carson, Colorado, received a Federal Achievement Award for Customer Service for innovative programs, such as its Direct Support Plus maintenance program, which  have  saved  $20  million  and  have  provided  better maintenance  for units, resulting in higher readiness.  Four Army individuals or small groups earned the Secretary of Defense Productivity Excellence Award for efforts resulting in a total saving of$12.8 million.

The Army's Leasing  Initiative,  developed  by  the  Resource Analysis and Business  Practices  Office of the  Office  of the  Assistant Secretary  of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller), in association with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Logistics, and Environment),  sought  to  remedy  financial  problems  at Army  installations by  selecting  private-sector firms  to work  with  the Army  to  maximize the value of instaJlation property currently needed but not fully  used,  with an eye to enhanced facility maintenance and repair, new revenue streams from outleasing,  and  reduced overhead costs. In FY 1998,  the Army  identified three installations to test the new strategy: Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona; Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey; and Fort Srun Houston, Texas. This initiative was  expected  to  earn  the  Army  an estimated  $20  million  in revenues as well as an unknown amount of  in-kind remuneration. At the same time, the Army was moving units from commercially leased space to renovated Army facilities. In FY 1998, four Army activities moved from leased space, with an additional twenty-one activities to be moved by FY 2001. Additional savings were  also  realized  from  the  Army  segment  of the  base  realignment  and closure (BRAC) initiative, as the program continued the trend of  net savings begun in FY 1997. FY 1998 saw the continuing pursuit of  the twenty-nine Army installation closures and  twelve  realignments  specified  in  the  1995 BRACround.

In response to  DOD  direction  to  eliminate open  allotments  and  gain front-end control over funds, in FY 1998 the Army changed its method for disbursing funds covering per diem and travel expenses for soldiers attending mandatory training, such as the Basic Noncommissioned Officers Course.

The  Military  Training  Specific  Allotment  (MTSA)  replaced  the  Military Training  Open Allotment (MTOA).  Under the MTOA,  individual  stations citing such funds did not know how much money was used, nor did they know how much money was in the account. As a result, the Army had no definitive means to determine how much was spent until the money was disbursed, and the stations had no incentive to  conserve funds. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) managed the  transition  intensively  to  ensure  that  the  shift  from  open  allotment  to specific funding would  have no  impact on training.  In FY  1998, the Army also made the decision to execute the MTSA funding in the mission accounts of each major command instead of the institutional training account in  the FY99 funding letter. Doing so standardized the management procedures for MTSA  funds with those used  for  other Operation and  Maintenance, Army (OMA), programs.

The Army Audit Agency continued  phase  II  of a  restructuring effort started during FY 1994 by moving to create a more flexible and responsive organization covering functional  areas through the use of audit teams.  By increasing  functional  expertise,  this  initiative  was  expected  to  decrease turnaround  time  for  audit engagements. The auditor general  of the Army approved the concept for implementation in FY 1999. He also approved the concept of incorporating the official Army position into final  audit reports. This  process  requires  auditors  to  work  with  clients  to  develop  feasible recommendations  addressing  problems  identified  by  audit.  The  auditors must also work with clients to obtain the official Army position on the audit report before, rather than after, publication. Reduced turnaround time was an FY98  priority for the Army Audit Agency. Notification time for informing Army customers of  impending General Accounting Office or DOD Inspector General action fell  from one week to  forty-eight hours, for instance.  Much of  this  efficiency was  gained  by incorporating  electronic  information technology  systems  into  agency operations.  During FY 1998,  the  agency issued 445 reports, resulting in potential monetary benefits of  approximately $1.602 billion.

The U.S. Army Cost and Economic Analysis Center (USACEAC) carried out a  variety  of activities  in  FY  1998.  It participated  in  development and review of  cost estimates for numerous major  Army weapons and information systems. The center presented briefmgs on the  Total Ownership Cost concept to civilian and DOD forums and chaired several cost subgroups, including those  for  the Army  Models  and  Simulation  Standards Workshop  and  the Consolidation  of Army Testing  General  Officers  Steering  Committee.  In addition, the USACEAC participated in numerous professional seminars and provided expert consulting services to a variety of  Army agencies. The center continued to improve methodologies for cost factors and cost data collection, implementing  one  for  the  IMPAC  credit card  in  the  National Guard  and

another intended to ensure that Integrated Sustainment Maintenance repair costs are  attributed  to  the correct major commands. The USACEAC also developed cost factors  for use  in  the Training Resource Model  employed in  development of the FY00-05 Program  Objective Memorandum (POM 00-05).

In the early  part of FY 1998, the chief of legislative liaison initiated a number of actions  intended  to  improve Army- congressional relations. To enhance  the Army's effectiveness  in  the  congressional  authorization  and budget  processes, the chief  oflegislative liaison directed his military assistant to chair a council of  colonels to establish a proposed set of top legislative priorities, later known as the Top Ten. These priorities became a key tool in helping the Army  remain  focused  on its  legislative  objectives.  Beginning in July  1998, two  officers were assigned to work on congressional strategy matters for the chief  of  legislative liaison.  One of these officers' long-term projects was to develop a system that would help ensure that every member of Congress had contact with an Army general officer.  The senior Army leadership  approved  the  system,  with  implementation  projected  for  May 1999. The chief of legislative liaison wanted to educate current and  future Army  leaders about the need  to  work well  with Congress. From the early spring of 1998, the chief  oflegislative liaison regularly spoke to the Garrison Commanders' Course, the Capstone Course for Brigadier Generals, and the Army War College Class (including all fellows), as well as at the conference for new brigadier generals. He also initiated action to have an entire edition of Military Review (April/May 1999) devoted to Army- Congress relations.

During FY 1998, Congress took a strong interest in a number of  Army› related issues. The Army and DOD position that favored gender-integrated training  created  considerable  debate.  In  the  Senate,  an  amendment  was attached to the Defense Authorization Bill that would have ended gender› integrated training, but Senators Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Max Cleland (D-Georgia)  sponsored  an opposing  amendment  that passed.  As  a  result, Congress  appointed  a  commission  to  review  gender-integrated  training throughout the DOD and to make recommendations in FY 1999. A number of  members of  Congress also took a strong interest in the Army's School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia. There was an attempt to terminate funding for the school, but the legislation failed on the House floor. A liaison officer in the Investigations and Legislation Division worked closely with the deputy undersecretary of  the Army for international affairs to educate many members of  Congress about the merits of  the school.

During FY 1998, the Office of  the Chief  of  Legislative Liaison (OCLL) escorted members from oversight committees on sixty-eight trips to observe Army  programs  and  activities.  This  marked  a  significant  increase  from previous years. The OCLL also initiated a plan to escort  junior congressional staff members to various Army posts and Civil War battlefields. In October

1998,  tllis  program,  known  as Army  Days, was scheduled  to  take  its  first trip (to Gettysburg) with more than one hundred staff members. During FY 1998, the OCLI.:s field operating agency, the Congressiona  Inquiry Division, I responded to more than thirty-two thousand written letters from members of Congress and one hundred thousand telephonic requests. The Congressional Inquiry Division also prepared 810 responses for signature by senior Army leaders and continued its mission of  notifying members of  Congress about Army contract awards that exceeded $5 million.  In FY 1998, there were 887 contract award notifications sent.

## Information Systems

The Army's  major information systems priority in FY 1998 was the "Year 2000" (Y2K) problem. Y2K problems arose in  older computer software that allotted only two digits to calendar year (for example, by  recording "1998" as "98"). This characteristic had the potential to lead to problems ranging in scale from  minor to catastrophic when such software attempted to  process information  containing  dates  for  the  year  2000  and  later.  Twenty-first› century  dates  would  thus  be  rendered  as  twentieth-century  dates  ("  1901" rather than "200  1  ,"  for  instance)  with a  resultant disruption  of date-based calculations. The Army placed items possibly subject to Y2K problems  in one of three categories: computers and networks, telecommunications, and facilities infi·astructure,  with the first two categories classified as information technology (IT) and the third as non-IT. Items in the facilities infrastructure category included traffic lights, water  pumps, card access readers, fire alarms, and elevators, as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The Army's installation  infrastructure was  generally  resistant  to  the Y2K problem. Becauseoflow  funding levels, installations have generally continued using older analog systems rather than more modern digital systems. The Y2K problem generally either did not affect these older systems or affected them  in  ways easy to  bypass.  Most weapons systems were  not affected  by the Y2K  problem  because  they did  not process calendar dates.  However, many other Army  systems,  especially computing systems concerned  with personnel, finance,  and logistics, contained substantial amounts of  software code carried over from older systems that rendered them susceptible.

The  Y2K  Program  Office  of the  Office  of  the  Army  Director  for Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (ODISC4)  carried out initiatives  to  ensure  that  the Y2K issue did not threaten  the Army's ability to execute its assigned missions before, during, and after the year 2000. The  Y2K Program Office, working under the auspices of  the Army's chief information officer (CIO), was responsible for establishing Army Y2K remediation policy and guidance, determining and reporting  the  status  of  Y2K remediation  efforts  throughout  the Army,  and

working with other government agencies and the private sector in addressing the overall Y2K issue.

The Y2K program in  the Army began around June  1995,  resulting in publication of  the first Army Project Change of  Century Action Plan in March 1996.  In  FY  1998,  the Y2K Program Office tracked the Y2K remediation status of  more than twenty thousand Army automated information systems (A  ISs) and half  a million IT-controlled devices, whose Y2K-related software errors were estimated to cost nearly $400 million to fix. A later-developing component of the Y2K program was an effort, led  by the assistant chief of staff for  installation  management  in  coordination with  the Y2K  Program Office, to forestall potentialY2K  problems in infrastructure  systems involving 140,000 buildings with 800 million square feet of  space. Significant activities of the Y2K Program  Office  during  FY  1998  included  the  completion  of collaborative  work  resulting  in  Federal Acquisition Regulations  requiri11g specific Y2K clauses in all IT contracts, effective 1 October 1998. The Army Y2K homepage was  totally redesigned and  updated. Additionally,  a Y2K database accessible through the World Wide Web was established, providing the  capability  to  maintain  real-time  status  reporting  on  Y2K  efforts  on all Army  systems. This  initiative significantly  improved  the accuracy and timeliness  of Y2K  information,  and  thus  enhanced  the  CIO's ability  to manage the overall Army Y2K program. The initiative  also responded to Y2K reporting requirements  of the  OSD,  the  Office  of Management and Budget, and Congress. The Army's  Y2K Action Plan was updated to provide more detailed guidance on system-criticality coding to establish priority for assessment and remediation, on conducting Y2K risk assessments, and on creating  interface  agreements,  contingency  planning,  testing,  and  system certification  requirements. The action plan further addressed the expanded role of  the installation commander in fixing the Y2K infrastructure problems in  the sustaining base.

The Army took steps  to  coordinate Army Y2K remediation efforts  in FY 1998. These included two major in-progress reviews with guest speakers from the DOD and the commercial sector and participation by Headquarters, Department  of the  Army  staff,  MACOM  staffs,  and  program  executive officers  (PEOs).  In  addition,  the  Army Y2K  Program  Office participated in more than sixty OSD-sponsored Y2K Interface Assessment Workshops, which provided an avenue for information exchanges with the other armed services and with allied countries to ensure that system interface information was current and complete. This process resulted in a  more comprehensive view  by  the  DOD  of the  interrelationships  of service,  DOD,  and  allied country systems. The Army also conducted a Y2K Industry Day to provide Army  system  managers  with  information  on  Y2K  automated  tools  and services available within the private sector that could help them in executing their  Y2K  responsibilities.  Additionally,  throughout  the  year,  the  Army

CIO,  as well as the vice chief of staff, Army, and the  undersecretary of the Army,  participated  in  monthly  DOD Y2K Steering Group meetings. These meetings, chaired by the deputy secretary of  defense, reviewed Y2K status throughout the  DOD and addressed critical policy issues concerning Y2K within the department. The Army began major efforts in FY 1998 to develop plans for end-to-end testing of  mission-critical systems and functions in an operational  environment in  conjunction  with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the OSD staffs.

In August 1998, the secretary and deputy secretary of  defense directed the  services  and  defense  agencies  to  develop  a  joint Y2K  operational evaluation plan  by  I  October 1998. In response, the secretary of  the Army, tluough the ODISC4, issued guidance to bring the Army into compliance by 4 September 1998. Army system owners (commanders, deputies for systems acquisition,  PEOs, and program managers) were directed to  verify the Y2K status of  all major systems under their purview. All interface agreements for mission-critical systems  were  to  be completed and entered  into  the Army Y2K database prior to the  l October deadline. System owners were to review and  update their  parts  of the Army Y2K database to validate each  major system's classification  as  mission-critical  or non-mission-critical  and  to ensure that aJI  major systems were included. The assistant secretary of the Army for research, development, and acquisition was directed to ensure that all Army contracts for information technology or national security systems that processed date-related information had the Y2K requirements (specified in  Section 39.106  of the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations)  included  by  1 October J 998.

In  FY  1998,  there  were  continued  improvements  to  the  automated information  system  supporting the Army  Operations  Center (AOC).  This included a sizable expansion of the unclassified local-area network (LAN), implementation  of a  browser-based  automated  message-handling  system (AMHS),  increased  use  of the  AOC  Web  page,  and  implementation  of a multitiered approach to information system security. An additional seventy› three workstations were directly connected to  the AOC's unclassified LAN. In  addition,  remote  dial-in  capability  was  added  to  the  AOC  network  to enable action officers traveling on assignments to dial into the unclassified LAN. This permitted the action officers to stay current with activities in the AOC, review and respond to e-mail, pass onsite mission-related information back to headquarters, and respond to pressing actions. This capability proved especially  beneficial  to  those  action  officers  engaged  in  military  support activities at field locations. On the classified system, the new browser-based AMHS improved performance while it provided action officers with a user› friendly  graphical  interface.  Anyone  who  routinely  used  a  Web  browser when accessing the Internet was able to readily use the new application with minimal training.

During the past several years, AIS security tools had been unable to keep up  with  increased user demands for new and improved systems caused by the explosion in IT. In FY 1998, there was a resurgent emphasis on securing the AIS, both Army- and DOD-wide. In keeping with this enhanced security posture, a multi  tiered approach to securing AOC systems was implemented. This  included  a  requirement  for  user  and  administrator  training  with  an emphasis  on security,  the  routine  publishing of security alerts  and  tips,  a renewed emphasis on audit log analysis, and the implementation of  multiple layers  of hardware  and  software  tools  specifically  designed to  protect the  systems  and  the  information  they  contain.  Specific  FY98  security enhancements included the installation of  an intrusion detection system to detect possible hacker activity, a firewall capable of  allowing access only to valid military users and further limiting the type of  access permitted by any users,  the  deployment of virus-scanning software capable of detecting and correcting known viruses on all AOC servers and client workstations, and the development of  audit data-reduction tools to assist security personnel in processing substantial bodies of  security audit information.

Title 44, U.S.  Code, section 3101, requires  federal agencies, including the Army,  to  make and  preserve agency records  that contain adequate and proper documentation of their organization,  functions,  policies, decisions, procedures,  and  essential  transactions.  Section  3102  of Title 44  requires agencies  to  establish  and  maintain  an active,  continuing program for  the economical and efficient management of their records.  Studies and events in preceding fiscal years (notably the lack of  documentation for the Persian Gulf War effort) indicated the  need for an improved records  management system  in  the Army. During FY  1998,  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for  Personnel  (ODCSPER),  and  the  Adjutant  General  Directorate (TAGD), U.S. Total Army Personnel Command (PERSCOM), sponsored a series of assessments  and  process  improvement sessions  relating to Army record keeping. Resultant ODCSPER guidance was to direct effort in three areas:  contingency  operations,  record-keeping  redesign,  and planning  for electronic records.

Initial  actions  taken  to  stem  the  loss  of records  from  contingency operations were the development of  a quick-reference guide for issuance to deployed soldiers and an emergency guidance message to reside in the AOC. The guide lists the minimum records that must be created, specifies collection frequency, and locations to which collected records are to be transferred. The Department of the Army developed and stored in the AOC a message to be released to the appropriate Army combatant commander when a contingency operation is declared. The message provides instructions for record-keeping requirements  during  the  operation.  Until  a  wholesale  redesign  of Army record keeping could  be effected,  these were interim solutions.  A series of sessions involving records managers and non-records Army  action offl.cers

resulted in  the potential elimination of J  02 of 105 user steps in  the record› keeping  process.  This  served  as  the  basis  for  a  record-keeping  redesign concept: Responsibility for records retention was transferred from units and offices to a centralized records-holding area; thirty-eight different retention periods  were  compressed  into  seven;  and  each  Army  regulation  would contain a matrix indicating whether to keep or transfer records generated by the regulation.

In FY  1998, increased usage of, and dependence on, electronic records resulted  in  the  development  of the Army  Information  Warehouse  (AIW) concept for efficient management of both hard copy and electronic Army records. The two major components of the AlW were the Army Electronic Research  System (AERS)  and  the Army  Electronic Archive  (AEA).  The AERS  allowed  for  record  searches  via  a  central  index,  regardless  of the records' physical  location  or  media  type.  The  AEA  provided  a  central storage facility  for Army activities lacking the local capability to  maintain electronic  records.  In  related  records  activity,  the  Records  Management Division,  TAGD,  PERSCOM,  established  an  electronic  reading  room  to give the public access to  frequently requested Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)  documents;  issued  a  citizens  guide  for  requesting  records  under the  FOIA;  and  revised  and  published  AR 25-55,  The  Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program,  1 November  1997. The U.S. Armed Services  Center for  Research of Unit Records  (CRUR)  conducted nine  S- 3/G- 3  Recall  Gulf War  Conferences,  adding  more  than  164,500 grid points, latitudes, longitudes, and place names to the DOD Persian Gulf Registry established  and  maintained  by  the CRUR.  During FY  1998,  the CRUR continued support to the Office of  the Special Assistant for GulfWar Illnesses on various  issues.  The center received  5,491  cases that  involved Gulf  War, Agent Orange, and post-traumatic stress disorder matters.

Army personnel systems made considerable strides in automation in FY 1998. The Standard Installation/Division Pers01mel System-3 (SfDPERS-3), the  computer hardware  and  software that  made up  the  U.S.  Army's next› generation  automated  field personnel  management  information  system, replaced all versions of the  SIDPERS-2. As the only proven Y2K solution for  the  SIDPERS,  the  SIDPERS-3  provided a  bridge for the  Army  to  the future all-service automated personnel system. Fielding of the SIDPERS-3 began with initial  implementation between July  1996 and December  1997 at  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground;  Fort  Jackson,  South  Carolina;  Fort  Drum, New York;  Fort Bragg,  North  Carolina;  Fort Benning,  Georgia;  and  Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Implementation of  the SIDPERS-3 at these installations raised major issues concerning reassignment processing, data reconciliation and synchronization, and error management. To  assist in the  resolution of these issues and smooth  future  transitions to the SIDPERS-3,  the  Enlisted Personnel Management Directorate (EPMD) of the PERSCOM established

a short-term SIDPERS-3 task force under the TAGD, PERSCOM, to create functional procedures to assist field  users in processing reassignments and other related enlisted personnel matters. The task force was succeeded by an EPMD SIDPERS-3 Task Force Section to review EPMD-related personnel processes at previously fielded SIDPERS-3 installations, assist installations prior to and following initial SIDPERS-3 activation, and provide continuing support ofSIDPERS-3 fielded sites. The  Task Force Section served to resolve SIDPERS-3- related problems by  acting as the liaison  between  field  users and field systems managers.

The Personnel Electronic Record Management System (PERMS) is an automated  document management system  that replaced  the Army's paper and microfiche military personnel record-keeping architecture. The PERMS, which consists of  commercially available optical digital imagery technology, enhanced military record quality and optimized record storage and retrieval operations  at  PERSCOM  agencies,  including  the  Management  Support Division of the TAGD and the U.S.  Army Enlisted Records and Evaluation Center of the TAGD, along  with the U.S. Army National Guard Readiness Center and the U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Command. The PERMS was originally managed by the AMC Program Executive Office, Standard Army Management Information Systems (PEO STAMIS).  During FY  1998,  the ODCSPER took over the responsibility for program management (including budget, configuration management, systems integration, and maintenance) from  the  PEO STAMIS. The ODCSPER assigned  to  the  PERSCOM the PERMS management responsibility, and the PERMS  Program Office was accordingly established under the Personnel Enterprise Systems Integration Office  of the  Personnel  Informational  Systems  Directorate  (PERSINSD). Handover  of  the PERMS  program  management  responsibility  to the PERSCOM was completed on 1 October 1998.

The  Inter-Component  Data  Transfer  (ICDT)  system  was  developed to  provide  the  automated capability of transferring data between the Total Army  Personnel  Database  (TAPDB)-Active  and  TAPDB-Reserve/Guard databases at the time of  a change in a service member's  activation status. The system has also provided a consolidated source of enlisted accession data from the U.S.  Army Recruiting Command Army Recruiting and Accession Data System (ARADS) to the TAPDB. During FY 1998, all of the ICDT software was tested and certified as  Y2K  compliant. Much of  the focus of  the ICDT project office in FY 1998 has been on the issue of mobilized soldiers arriving at mobilization stations before their automated record arrived. The two major problem areas were failure of  the Reserve field system to pass to the Top of the System software data communicating intent to mobilize and data interface breakdown between the active Top of the System and its new field  system, the SIDPERS-3. The ICDT system was originally envisioned as a necessary step in  modernizing the TAPDB. That modernization is now

referred to as the Integrated TAPDB (ITAPDB), which was in initial concept design stages. The immediate focus of  the ITAPDB was on resolving issues in  the  mobilization  process,  the development of an ITAPDB-Mobilization automated  functionality  using  a  commercial  off-the-shelf  product,  and the coordination of any ITAPDB concept with that of the DOD Integrated Military Human Resources System.

During FY 1998, the Army continued to improve its existing recruiting information  system  while  developing  and  fielding  the  successor  system. The ARADS  is  the  incumbent  system  for  collecting  and  processing  all information regarding every new enlistee into the Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard, and then forwarding this information to the TAPDB. The ARADS also distributes to the recruiting force hundreds of thousands of records  concerning  recruiting  leads,  and electronically  interfaces  with both the Military Entrance Processing Command system for information on applicant processing and  the  Keystone-Recruit Quota System for making training seat reservations.  In addition, the ARADS serves as the command's military personnel management system. FY 1998 encompassed the last two option periods of  the extended ARADS contract. During the fiscal year, the plan for movement from the ARADS to its successor system was completed. The plan allows the ARADS to continue functioning by using new client› server  equipment  until its successor system, the  Army Recruiting Information Support System  (ARISS),  is  fully  implemented.  The deployment  of new ARADS client-server equipment, which was completed during FY 1998, is expected to result in substantial savings to the government before the ARISS reaches full operational capability (projected for FY 2001).

The  ARISS  was  formerly  the  Joint  Recruiting  Information  Support System  (JRISS),  which  was  abandoned  as  a  joint  system  because  of inadequate funding and the difficulty of  achieving commonality. The ARISS offers single data  entry, a common database and operating environment using DOD standardized data,  commercial off-the-shelf software  and  hardware architecture, office automation and multimedia sales presentation mobility using the  laptop  recruiter workstations, desktop units  for supporting stafT, and  servers. This  fully  integrated  system  led  to  multiple improvements in efficiency for the Army recruiting community. During FY 1998, the ARISS program took advantage of the aggressive development momentum of the JRISS. The ARISS, which was tailored  specifically for the Army,  pursued the  functionality  goals  of  the  earlier  Army  Recruiting  2000  initiative. An  on-site  project  manager,  under  the  direction  of the  PEO  STAMIS, managed the ARISS. The J\RISS project management office reviewed and selected  emerging  development  technologies  in  several  areas,  including relational  databases  management systems;  high-performance client-server architectures; portable, mobile-office computing; multimedia presentations; graphical  user  interfaces;  and data administration using standardized data

managed through computer-aided software engineering tools. At the end of FY 1998, a communications system was in place, state-of-the-art sales video programming was available on laptop platforms, and the DOD goal of  single data entry was supported through efficient graphical user interface screens.

The  Defense  Casualty  Information  Processing  System  (DCIPS)  is intended  to provide a  standardized,  integrated  casualty support system for use  by all  services  in  peacetime, mobilization, and wartime.  Although  the DCIPS  is  a  DOD  system,  its  software  is  written  and  maintained  by  the PERSCOM. The DCIPS is expected to provide standard automated support for  the  management  of casually  and  mortuary  affairs  by  each  service's casualty  office  and  mortuary  affairs  office.  During  FY  1998,  the  DOD provided additional funds  for  the continued transfer of data and operations from  the  predecessor system,  the Army  Casualty  Information  Processing System  Graphical  User Interface  (ACIPS-G),  to  the  DCIPS. These  funds also allowed for the purchase of  a server and workstation running Microsoft Windows NT for the DCIPS help desk. The PERSCOM PERSINSD, assisted by the same contractors who developed the ACIPS-G, planned the transition from the ACIPS-G to the DCJPS, as well as the continuing technical support and maintenance of the DCIPS. The DCIPS Migration Plan governing the transition  was  written during  the  spring of 1998.  During  the summer, the help desk for support to the services was established.

## Budget

The president's 1998  budget for the Army totaled $60.4 billion. After normalization for supplemental appropriations, transfers, and inflation, the Army's total obligation authority for FY 1998 was $59.7 billion in constant FY98 dollars. This figure represents a loss in buying  power of$3  .8 billion from FY 1997 and a loss of$5.9 billion from actual FY 1996 obligation authority.

In  a  time  of constrained  resources,  trade-offs  must  be  made  among competing readiness and modernization priorities. The FY98 Army Budget Estimate  Submission  reflected  a  program  crafted  to  support the  National Military Strategy and carefully balanced to build a more efficient Army by proposing such  trade-offs to  ensure  readiness  now  and  in  the  future.  The budget provided for a force structure often active-component divisions, up to eight Army National Guard divisions, fifteen Army National Guard enhanced brigades, and a tailored reserve component combat support/combat service support  structure.  The  budget  estimate  contained  additional  funding  to support the Army National Guard division redesign. The budget maintained near-term  readiness  by  fully  funding  operating  tempo  (OPTEMPO)  for the active  component and adequately funding  it for the reserve component (RC).

On the  materiel  front,  the  budget estimate  provided strategic mobility funding and completed the final phase of  Army war reserve pre-positioning in Southwest Asia. It sustained critical research, development, and acquisition programs, such as the Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter, the Army Tacti~al Missile System/Brilliant Anti-Armor precision-strike submunition, and  upgrades  to  the  Abrams  tank.  The  budget also  sustained  funding  for the Family of  Medium Tactical Vehicles. The budget maintained OMA base support funding.  In  addition, the budget adequately funded  quality-of-life and  soldier  support  programs,  such  as  educational  opportunities,  tuition assistance, and transition counseling.

To accommodate these Army  priorities, the FY98  budget made some concessions.  Army  modernization  efforts  were  focused  only  on  early› deploying units. The budget constrained funding for combat training centers in  favor of  modernization investments to enhance home-station training. In the procurement area, the FY98 budget terminated the Black Hawk multiyear procurement for FY  1998- 200 I.  The FY98  budget also ended production of the Hellfire II  missile and  slowed  procurement of the Dradley fighting vehicle.  The  budget  funded  only  critical  depot  maintenance.  Finally,  the budget decreased Army family  housing construction  in favor of efforts to involve the private sector in meeting Army housing needs.

In  FY  1991, the  DOD  initiated the practice of annually submitting an omnibus reprogramming action to Congress. The purpose of  the action is to incorporate all DOD reprogramming requirements into a single package for congressional  committees  to  consider  as  a whole.  The  ornni  bus reprogramming consists  of reprogramming proposals submitted  by  all  services. The OSD submitted  the  FY98  annual  omnibus reprogramming action  on  24 August J 998.  As  required,  the  Army's  submission  balanced  $239.7  million  in FY98 requirements for designated programs with cuts in  the same amount from  other  programs.  An  increase  to  the  Operations  and  Maintenance, Army  National  Guard,  account  was  made  for  the  Operational  Support

Airlift Agency,  which provides short-notice air movement for high-priority passengers and cargo. An increase for readiness requirements was requested for OMA; and Aircraft Procurement, Army, was increased to pay for Kiowa helicopter modifications.  Proposed funding sources included reductions  in projected inflation rates as  well  as various programmatic reductions to the Procurement and  Research,  Development, Test,  and  Evaluation  accounts. With the exception ofthe National Guard increases, Congress approved all the Army requirements. Because it approved only$  91.5 million of  the cuts J proposed  as  funding  sources,  the Kiowa modification  program and  some readiness requirements, although approved, were not funded.

The Army expresses its future budgetary needs in a POM assembled in accordance with the Defense Planning Guidance issued by the secretary of defense. The Army POM for fiscal years 2000- 2005 sought to position the U.S. Army for the future. POM 00-05 was built on the operational concepts identified in Joint Vision 2010 and Army Vision 2010. Both visions rely on the active engagement of  land forces that employ information superiority to dominate opponents across the spectrum of  conflict. The Army weighed near› term readiness requirements against long-term modernization requirements and attempted to meet both needs. Critical components of  the Army program were inadequately funded. Under  POM 00- 05, OPTEMPO funds would move to facilities support because facilities support was significantly underfunded, compared with funding levels in previous years. Reductions to  modernization accounts were unavoidable, given the realities of  price increases in working capital  funds  (revolving funds  within  the DOD that finance  organizations intended to operate like commercial businesses), increased OPTEMPO costs, and pay increases. POM 00-05 accepted considerable risk in both readiness and  modernization to accommodate the demands of the Defense Planning Guidance. Greater resources, obtained through the realignment and closure of bases or the realignment of DOD funding, together with containment of defense agency rate increases (the accounting charges for goods and services exchanged between agencies) and realization of  increased efficiencies, would be required to resolve Army readiness problems for the long term.

Army  POM  00-05  supported  an  active-component  end  strength  of 480,000, organized into the four-corps, ten-division stmcture directed by the Defense Planning Guidance and validated during the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a DOD-wide joint review of the fundamental assumptions governing the conduct of  the defense of  the United States. The RC structure continued to shift during the POM years because the  Army expected to exploit the full capabilities of  the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard while planning to achieve its QDR objective of a 45,000-person reduction in RC force  structure  by the end of FY 2002.  The  initial  cut of twenty thousand would be achieved by the end of  FY  2000 and was apportioned as a reduction of seventeen thousand in  the Army National Guard and  tlu·ee thousand in

the Army Reserve. The remaining twenty-five thousand RC reductions would be  apportioned through  the Total  Army Analysis - 07 process.  When  QDR reductions  are  completed,  RC  end  strength  will  be  at  530,000.  The Army National  Guard  maintained  fifteen  enhanced  brigades  (seven  heavy,  seven light, and one  armored cavalry regiment) as part of  the total Army's  warfighting capability. Army civilians made up approximately 18 percent of  the total Army workforce,  providing  positional stability  and  institutional  knowledge  across the  full  spectrum of  operations, including supply,  maintenance, sustainment, readiness,  training,  acquisition,  and  research  and development.  POM 00- 05 reduced civilian manpower by fourteen thousand from FY 2000 to  FY 2005. The FY00-05  civilian  manpower program  reflected  reshaping efficiencies, competition  and  privatization  initiatives,  and  other  efficiencies.  The  FY05 projected civilian  manpower total of  210,000 was eight thousand closer than prior POM fi&amp;rures  to  the  Defense Planning Guidanc.:  goal of two  hundred thousand.

Readiness  continued  to  be the Army's number-one  priority.  It  required that soldiers and  units be well  trained. The Army POM 00-05 programmed resources against  this requirement in accordance with the first-to-fight principle and  force  packaging.  Total  Army  operating  tempo  and  militaty  personnel accounts increased by $3.284 billion and $783 million, respectively,  to  meet critical  requirements.  Army  National  Guard  operating and  support funding increased by $2.494 billion in the POM, reflecting the "One  Team, One Fight, One Future" resourcing strategy.  POM 00-05 forecast procurement of future systems envisioned by the IT-intensive Army XXI initiative, fully equipping a division  with the new battlefield  command-and-control systems in FY 2000 and a  corps in FY 2004.  For  the  longer-range future,  the Army After Next initiative sets a planning horizon beyond that of  Army XXI to the requirements of  land forces tlu·ough the year 2025. Army POM 00- 05 proposed funding of a  series of war games, workshops,  and seminars to identify the technologies necessary to provide the Army After Next force  with the physical agility  to complement the  mental  agility  of Army  XXI.  Whereas  the Army  reduced funds for modernization, it sought to protect its most important modernization programs, including digitization and leap-ahead science and technology. It did so at the cost of  taking much greater risk in recapitalization programs aimed at refurbishing the current force's equipment and .in the maintenance of  combat overmatch against prospective battlefield threats.

Infrastructure was the last priority in the Defense Planning Guidance. As a result, in POM 00-05 accounts supporting  Army infrastructure were reduced first, in  order  to pay readiness bills.  The  Army  decreased base  operations suppott and real propetty maintenance funding by $1.493 billion and $1.051  billion, respectively. Although in accordance with DOD priorities, these programmed reductions were likely to cause increased  movement of  OPTEMPO funds and potential reprogramming from modernization accounts in the year of  execution.

## Personnel

The Army originally planned to reduce FY98 end strength to 485,000. In its FY98 budget, however, Congress required the Army to maintain its FY98 end  strength at 495,000,  plus or minus 7,425  (1.5  percent).  The Army  fell short of this target even as it  worked to  increase acquisition and retention of personnel. During FY 1998, the strength of  the active Army decreased by  1.5 percent, from 49 I  ,707 at the  beginning of the year to 483,880 at year's end. The strength of the Army National Guard (ARNG) fell  slightly more than 2 percent, from 370,044 at the end ofFY 1997 to 362,444 at the end ofFY 1998. For  both years,  this  was  a  fraction  of a  percentage  point above  authorized strength. U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) end strength for FY 1998 was 204,968 Selected Reserve personnel (down from 212,850 at the end ofFY 1997), with an additional459,636 personnel serving in the Individual Ready Reserve.

Members  of  minority  groups  and  women  continued  to  be  major contributors to the strength of  the Army. Minority groups represented 40.1 percent  of active  Army  end  strength;  women  represented  14.8  percent. Minority groups  represented 26.0  percent of ARNG end strength; women represented  9.9  percent  of the  total.  Minorities  made  up  40.6  percent  of USAR FY98 end strength; women represented 24.2 percent. These figures generally represented slight increases over the figures in FY 1997.

## Enlisted Personnel

Through January 1998, the Army carried higher strengths than originally programmed because of  declining first-term soldier attrition and higher-than› expected enlisted accessions. As a result, February 1998 estimates of  FY98 active Army end strength were more than 488,000, above the end-strength floor  of 487,575,  with average  strength figures  exceeding  those  budgeted in  the  manpower program  by  up to  $49  million.  In response,  the enlisted accession mission was lowered from 77,500 at the statt  of  the fiscal year to a final mission of72,550. An unexpected and rapid upturn in first-term losses, particularly to attrition  in the first  six  months  of service,  was  identified  in April 1998, and this trend continued. The U.S. Army Recruiting Center was unable to respond to the sudden demand for enlisted accessions to offset the unanticipated losses, and fell 797 accessions short of  its final FY98 mission. In an effort to achieve the congressional end-strength floor, the Army added

1,487 of  two thousand pla1med FY99 recruits to its rolls in the final two days of FY  1998. The number proved to be insufficient, but it was the most that the Army was able LO recruit successfully.

The ARNG enlisted  57,533 soldiers  in  FY 1998 (31, J  51  prior-service personnel and 25,487 non- prior service personnel [NPS)), slightly exceeding its en listment  objective of56,638. The USAR  en!  is  ted 44,2 1  I soldiers (26,393 with  prior service and  17,8 18  NPS); this  total  fell  short of the  enlistment objective of  47,940.

Despite  its  failure  to achieve  desired  end-strength  levels,  the  total Army exceeded its FY98 overall retention objectives. Accomplislu11ents by category are given in Table 2.

The reserve component (RC) also achieved its affiliation goal (the sum of direct enlistment of  civilians in the RC  plus transitions from  the  active Army)  in  FY  1998. Through  concerted  efforts  to  reduce  attrition  and  to retain  soldiers  with  FY98  separation  dates,  the  RC  exceeded  their  goal of II,  I  00  transitions from  the  active Army with  l I  ,600 reserve affiliation contracts.

The  Army  took  several  steps  to improve  retention.  The  indefinite› reenlistment program for career soldiers (staff sergeants or higher with ten or more years  of service)  was  implemented on  l  October  1998,  enabling these soldiers to serve indefinitely up to the career retention point for their rank.  Initial response was overwhelmingly positive. The Army changed the reenlistment eligibility  window at the start of FY  1998  to  permit soldiers to  reenlist  as  early  as  twelve  months  before  their separation  date  versus eight  months  prior  under  the  old  policy.  The  Army  expanded  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) payments during FY 1998  by $13.5  million to offset  potential  losses  of critical  and  technical  skills  that  were  becoming harder to retain because of  a strong civilian economy and job opportunities in the  civilian  sector. The  SRB  program,  managed by the Enlisted Personnel Management Directorate, U.S. Total Army Personnel  Command (PERSCOM), targeted selected Military Occupational Specialties, language skills,  Special  Qualification  Identifiers,  and  Additional  Skill  Identifiers, totaling approximately one hundred subjects in FY 1998. The Army retention regulation, AR 601-280, Army Retention  Program, was completely revised

from the 29 September 1995 version. The new edition of  AR 601-280 would give broader roles in retention management to commanders and command sergeants major, as well as broader waiver authority.  In addition, enhanced counseling initiatives were  implemented. The  regulation was  still in legal channels  at  the  end  of FY  1998,  but  release  and  printing  were  expected during the late second quarter or early third quarter of  FY 1999.

The Army made additional persom1el policy changes aimed at improving retention during FY  1998. The requirement for soldiers to  reenlist no  later than  ninety  days  prior to  the  end  of their  term  of service  was  lifted  for soldiers whose terms would end in FY 1998. Previously, Department of  the Army policy stated that soldiers in the rank of  private fmt class (PFC) were ineligible  to  reenlist,  but several  changes  to  this  policy  were  established. PFCs on initial enlistments of three or fewer years (if otherwise qualified), reenlisting before attaining twenty-six months of  total active federal service, became eligible to reenlist for a period not to exceed six years, twenty-nine days. PFCs on initial enlistments of  four years or fewer with at least twenty› one months of continuous active federal  service (who were eligible for the SRB) became eligible to reenlist for a period not to exceed five years. Total active service could not exceed seven years, twenty-nine days.  PFCs who incurred a service-remaining requirement imposed by the Department of  the Army (if otherwise qualified) became eligible for extension or reenlistment. Extension would be  only for the time  necessary to fulfi 11 the service-remaining requirement.  Prior-service soldiers could exceed seven years,  twenty-nine days. These soldiers would be permitted to reenlist for the time necessary to fulfill  the service-remainjng requirement,  not to exceed the time-in-service Retention Control Point for the next higher rank.

Authority  to  approve  waivers  of  bars  to  reenlistment  for  one-time occurrence of Absence Without  Leave  (AWOL)  or lost  time  for  soldiers with ten  or  fewer years of active  federal  service was  implemented  during FY 1998. In the case of  soldiers with up to fifleen  days AWOL or lost time, commanders  of battalion-sized  units  with  at  least  the  rank  of lieutenant colonel or special court-martial convening authority (as appropriate  to  the case) gained waiver-approval authority.  In cases involving sixteen to thirty days'  AWOL or lost time, the first general officer or  the general courts-martial convening authority, whichever was the more direct line to the soldier,  held waiver-approval authority. Waivers for AWOL or lost time exceeding thirty days would be submitted to the Enlisted Personnel Management Directorate, PERSCOM.

In addition to  its  efforts to  improve  accession  and retention, the Army also addressed  the  problem of attrition. First-term attrition  refers  to  those initial-term soldiers who depart the Army before serving thirty-six months. Army personnel managers track first-term attrition by cohort, or year group, over those three years in two grand divisions: from zero to six months, which

represents predominantly soldiers in the training base; and from seven to cohort attrition rate has averaged between 35 and 37 percent over the last ten years; that is, of one hundred soldiers who enter the Army in a given year; thirty-five to thirty-seven will separate before completing three years of service. Projected first-term attrition is 37.81 percent after three years for the FY98 cohort. This is a significant increase from the FY97 cohort, projected to be 35.64 percent after three The increase can be attributed to a substantial rise in attrition in the training base and some increase in the units. There was a rise in attrition in December 1996. The chief of staff; (CSA), outlined the problem to commanders in the field and asked them to review their programs. Concurrently; the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (ODCSPER) recommended resorting to the rehabilitative transfer   program as an alternative to separation: In   addition; the withdrew soldiers to request discharge before the end of their term of service after imposition of a bar to reenlistment. Army years. Army Army option

In December 1997, total attrition decreased to a low for the fiscal year of 34 percent. The rate for soldiers with six months' service or less then rose to a peak of 18.85 percent in July 1998. The attributed some of the increase to changes in the training base that increased standards and rigor: Similarly, attrition was on the rise in the seven- to thirty-six-month cohort in field units, increasing from an annualized rate of 6.5 percent in December 1997 to a rate of 7.4 percent in September 1998. The acceptable band of unit attrition is between 5 and 7 percent. Tables 3-5 show quarterly attrition figures for FY 1998. Army

Personnel an important   bearing on both   retention  and attrition.  In late 1997, the CSA became exceedingly concerned about the operating and personnel tempo ofthe The personnel tempo was putting tremendous demand on all soldiers, especially middle-grade officers and noncommissioned officers. Of particular concern was the negative impact of back-to-back deployments. Although FY98 retention was satisfactory; the overriding long-term concern was burn-out for those soldiers who were frequently deployed and who chose separation as a measure to resolve the dilemma. The CSA directed that efforts be expended to develop personnel policies that took care of soldiers and their families while preserving force readiness. Army.

In September 1997, the commanding general, PERSCOM, initiated the stabilization study to determine ways to increase soldiers' average time on station (TOS) or their FY 1998, the stabilization study was a major focus for PERSCOM analysts; who developed a number of computer algorithms to improve the quality of enlisted soldiers historical data to create a more effective analysis of TOS. Major factors included the percentage of the stationed overseas, tour length, attrition; proportion of females in units, and proportion of fenced? units (units unavailable for reassigning personnel). The PERSCOM Analysis Branch developed computer models of TOS, including soldier- and forcebased statistical models; as well as stochastic and deterministic simulation stay Army

flow models used to simulate the movement of  the soldier population through the personnel system.

Insights from the study were used to suggest changes to Army personnel policy. The Deployment Stabilization Policy was approved and implemented in February 1998. It mandated that, wherever possible, soldiers would enjoy a  month  of stabilization  at  their  home  station  for  every  month  they  are deployed as paJt of  specified operations. During this period of  stabilization, soldiers could not be  involuntarily placed on temporary duty or temporary change of station away  from  their home stations to participate in specified operations other than war. The purpose of  the policy was to ensure a level of fairness in the treatment of  soldiers placed on temporary duty and temporary change  of station  for  lengthy  periods  of time.  The  policy  also  enabled soldiers  to  reacquaint  themselves  with  their families  and  readjust to  their working  environments.  Management of the  program was decentralized  to field commanders.

## Officer Personnel

Officer strength at the end ofFY 1998 was 78,425. FY98 officer strength was thus slightly lower than the FY97 strength of301 general officers, 67,254 other commissioned officers, and 11,750 warrant officers (Table 6).

Table 7 summarizes FY98 officer accessions by source of commission and  competitive  category  from  the  end  of FY  1998.  Categories  are  the general-duty Army Competitive Category,  warrant officer, chaplain, judge advocate general, and Army Medical Department.

Table 8 summarizes FY98  officer promotions, by grade,  by  the Army Competitive Category, the general population of  nonspecialist commissioned officers. The table shows  the  number of officers selected for promotion by time-in-grade  zone  (above,  primary,  and  below)  and  total  selections;  the number of officers considered to  be  in the promotion zone; the  promotion rate specified by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA rate), which equals total selected divided by the number considered to be in the promotion zone; and the DOPMA goal. Selection rates in FY 1998 were generally closer to  DO  PMA goals than they were  in FY  1997. Exceptions were the rates for majors and  lieutenant colonels, which were farther from the goals.

Table 9 shows average years of commissioned service at which Army Competitive Category officers were promoted. All the FY98  averages  for years of commissioned  service thus fell  within the range specified by  the DOPMA. In general, the averages came closer to the exact DOPMA goal did than those of  the previous fiscal year. The exception was the average years of commissioned service at promotion for captains, which stayed constant.

A  variety  of changes  in  officer  personnel  management  and  in  the information systems  that  support  them  were  implemented  in  FY  1998. The  training  branch  of the  Training  and  Analysis  Division  within  the Office of  the Deputy Chief of Staff  for Operations, PERSCOM developed new officer-training requirements. The adoption of the Officer Personnel Management System XXI (OPMS XXI) required revision of  Department of the Army  (DA)  Pamphlet 600-3, Commissioned Officer Development and Career Management (8 June  1995). The new edition of  that pamphlet, scheduled  for publication  on 1  October  1998,  generates  signi11cant doctrinal  changes  and  new  career training  paths  for  some  officers.  The training branch developed  training  requirements for new functiona l-area courses necessitated by lhc OPMS XXI. These requirements were accepted at the Structure and Manning Decision Review  for FY 200 I through FY 2003, which ensured that resources would be allocated to the OPMS XXI courses for those fiscal years. The  new Officer  Evaluation Reporting System (OERS) was implemented on 1 October 1997 for the active Army and Title 10 National Guard officers, on I June 1998 for National Guard and Title 32 officers, and on  I October 1998 for all Army Reserve officers. Before the implementation, the Management Support Division, the Adjutant General Directorate,  PERSCOM,  distributed  OERS  information  and  education documents  to  the  field.  This  distribution  consisted  of 200,000  copies of AR 623-105, Officer  Evaluation  Reporting System (l October  1997), and  350,000  copies  of a  supplementary  instructional  pamphlet  for  OA

Pamphlet 623- l  05, The  Officer Evaluation  Reporting System  "In-Brief" (1 October 1997). These items also were made available online.

The new OERS included four basic elements: (  1) a reinvigorated support form process; (2) two initiatives aimed at junior officer developmentthe Junior Officer Developmental Support Form (JODSF) and the  restricting of  access  to reports  written by the  superiors  of second  lieutenants, intended  to  avoid  the  reports' having a  prejudicial  effect  on  the second lieutenant's  subsequent career (otherwise known as "masking" the report); (3)  improvements  in  the  administrative and rater portions of the  OERS; and  (4)  restoration of senior rater accountability.  New  policies  included requirements for senior raters to pass their updated support forms two levels down to  the rated  personnel  as  a model, and for raters to conduct initial performance counseling in October, as well as for raters of  lieutenants and warrant officers-! to initiate JODSFs in October. On 1 December 1997, an OERS update was  mailed  to  all brigade  and battalion  commanders. The update  included worksheets and an OERS Management Plan intended to help senior raters maintain credible profilesthat is,  profiles not showing a  history  of disproportionately  high  ratings.  The  biannual  Senior Rater Updates were mailed to all senior raters in January and June 1998.

The Officer Record Brief(ORB) provided a variety ofusers a concise, accurate, and timely view of an officer's career, a one-page snapshot of  a commissioned or warrant officer's personnel record.  The  brief contains both current and historical information pertaining to an individual' s career. Almost every decision made about an officer's career is influenced by the data shown on the ORB. During FY 1998, efforts began to identify ORB systems that might no longer be needed or might not be used. Elimination of the  ORB Annual Audit System (DAPCX-215) was  completed by  31 December 1997. Eliminating this system saved the printing of a quarter› million  ORBs.  Additionally,  the  production  of separation  ORBs  was discontinued, thus saving additional production costs.

The Total  Officer Personnel Transaction  Update  System  (TOPTUS) provides the capability to post updated commissioned and warrant officer personnel transactions to the  Total  Army Personnel Database-Active Officer (TAPDB-AO). The TOPTUS  is used  only to  process  batch  transactions and  docs  not  do  the  online  updates  that  are  handled  through  the  Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS; described below). Input transactions are collected and processed twice daily, Monday through Friday. The  system's  566 interrelated programs perform edit, audit, update, and feedback functions and then post data directly to the TAPDB› AO.  As of the end of FY 1998,  the  system has the capability  to  process both Standard Installation/Division Personnel System  (SIDPERS)-2  and SIDPERS-3  transactions.  After  full  implementation of the  SIDPERS-3, the SIDPERS-2 programs can be deleted with very little effort.

The total  redesign of the Officer Master File for compatibility with the TOPTUS began  in  FY  I  993  and  was completed and  went into production in  July  1994.  During  FY  1998,  the  Military Systems  Division,  Personnel Information Systems Directorate, PERSCOM, undertook several new tasks that had a direct impact on the  TOPTUS and the Officer Master File database. The  division  supplied  numerous  officer  data  sets  for  the  development and testing of the  Force  Manning  System  as  well as  for  the  new  Officer Evaluation Report System. In addition, the division generated more than four hundred pages ofTOPTUS  interface  information for the Defense Military Human Resources System. This information provided the ODCSPER with every data  element on every file  that is  used  as TOPTUS  input  or output. The PERSCOM also  worked  with Walter Reed  Army Medical  Center  to automate the processing ofHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) data. The main focus of  work on the TOPTUS during FY I  998 was Y2K certification for the system. The entire system was analyzed, program changes were made and tested where necessary, and a Y2K notebook was prepared. The critical portion of  the TOPTUS was Y2K certified in early June 1998, well ahead of schedule.

The  TO  PM  IS provides the capability to update  commissioned and warrant officer personnel data  in  the TAPDB-AO. The TOPMIS  is  used  only to do online updates and does not process batch transactions, which are handled through the TOPTUS. Personnel data can be entered twenty-four hours daily for direct updates to the TAPDB-AO. The TOPMIS's  two hundred programs edit, audit, update, and provide feedback on personnel data. During FY 1998, the Military Systems Division, Personnel Information Systems Directorate, PERSCOM, mainly focused on getting the TOPMIS Y2K certified. As in the case of the TOPTUS, the TOPMIS was approved as Y2K certified in  early June 1998, well ahead of  schedule.

During FY  1998,  command  opportunities  for  lieutenant colonels  and colonels in the combat service support branches increased as Army combat service  support  units  and  activities  were  activated  or  reorganized.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service established tlu·ee new conu11ands during FY 1998at San Antonio, Texas; Lawton, Oklahoma; and Orlando, Florida. The San Antonio operating location was activated in the summer of 1998, with the Orlando and Lawton locations to be activated during FY 1999.  Command  opportunities  for  Ordnance  Corps  officers  increased  in FY 1998, as commands previously open to officers from both the Ordnance Corps  and  Chemical  Corps  became specialized.  Blue  Grass Army Depot (AD),  Richmond,  Kentucky;  Crane  Army  Ammunition  Activity,  Crane, Indiana; McAlester Army Ammunition Plant (AAP), McAlester, Oklahoma; and Sierra AD, Herlong, California, became open only to ordnance branch colonels.  The  91 st  Ordnance  Battalion  and  the  6th  Ordnance  Battalion became open only to ordnance lieutenant colonels. Command of  Hawthorne

AAP, Hawthorne, Nebraska; Iowa AAP, Middletown, Iowa; Lake City AAP, Independence,  Missouri;  Lone  Star AAP,  Texarkana,  Texas;  Milan  AAP, Milan, Tennessee; Seneca AD, Romulus, New York; and Tooele AD, Tooele, Utah, became open only to ordnance lieutenant colonels. Pine Bluff  Arsenal, Pine  Bluff,  Arkansas,  became open  only to  chemical officers.  During FY J  998, quartermaster officers were given expanded opportunities to compete for multifunctional commands as both lieutenant colonels and colonels. The Combat Equipment Battalion-Northeast Asia is a new battalion command, located in Taegu,  Korea, scheduled to  open as a two-year command tour in June  2000. In  addition, two new brigade command opportunities are expected to open in  the summer of 2000:  (I) Defense Reutilization and  Marketing› International,  a  subordinate  command  of the  Defense  Logistics  Agency located  in  Wiesbaden,  Germany,  and  (2)  the  Combat  Equipment  Group› Southwest Asia,  a subordinate command of the Army Material  Command located in Kuwail.

The OPMS XXI established several new functional  areas in  FY  1998, one of  them being Strategic Plans and Policy. In February  1998, a Personnel Proponent Office was established to fulfill the responsibilities for Functional Area  (FA)  50,  Strategy and Force Management.  FA  50  encompasses  two areas of concentration:  50A, Force Management; and 50B, Strategic Plans and Policy. As the work of  the OPMS XXI Implementation Team progressed, it  became obvious that the needs of the Army  would  be better served  by establishing a  separate functional  area  for each area of concentration.  On 7 August  1998,  the  CSA  approved  the  establishment of FA  59,  Strategic Plans and Policy,  with  the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS)  being  the  proponent  and  the  Director of Strategy,  Plans,  and Policy  in  the  Office  of the  DCSOPS  being  his  executive  agent  for  this functional area. For the rest of  the fiscal year, the Office of  the DCSOPS FA 59 Proponency Office concentrated on the recoding of  Army Authorization Documents Systems documents to reflect billets requiring the assignment of FA 59 officers. The recoding was not complete at the end of  the fiscal year.

## Civilian Personnel

The  number of civilians  employed  by  the  Army  has  been  steadily declining as the Army has drawn down its force. Overall civilian strength, including foreign-national employees  and Army National Guard  technicians, declined  by  10,700  in  FY  1998,  from  243,200  to  232,500.  The  Army has  reduced  its  civilian  strength  by  42  percent (from 402,900)  since  the drawdown began in FY 1989. The average age and tenure of  Army civilians have been increasing since the start of  the drawdown. Between FY 1989 and FY 1998, their average age went from 43.0 to 46.2 and their average years of service rose from  13.5  to  16.8. There were  15,150  retirement-eligible

Army civiliansdefined as those qualifying  for optional  retirement (not including discontinued service or Federal Employees Retirement System reduced aru1Uity)at  the  end of fiscal year  1998,  making up  7.3  percent of the  workforce.  That  was  an  increase  in  both  absolute  numbers  and percentage of workforce  from  fiscal  year  1997  (14,369 and  6.7 percent, respectively). Minorities represented 29.4 percent of the total workforce; women represented 46.8 percent of the whole.

On  15  September  1998, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense issued new guidance for civilian management for fiscal years  1999 through  2003. The  guidance  changed  the  allowable  proportion  of personnel  in  senior grades, GS-14 and above. Such personnel must account for no more than 7.4 percent of  the Army's total full-time permanent professional, administrative, and  technical workforce. This guidance was  less stringent than the method used to assign senior grades at the onset ofthe reduction program i n 1993.

The  Civilian  fluman  Resources  Strategic  Plan  for  fiscal  years  1999 through  2005,  published  in  September 1998,  communicated  corporate vision, areas of  emphasis, and performance goals to guide the Army civilian human resources community in  its seven-year effort to manage the civilian workforce and to improve the delivery of  its services. The plan implemented a three-tier process:

- I. The strategic plan  would  drive  annual  organizational  operational plans, including measurable objectives and actions to achieve the planning goals.
- 2. Planning goals then would drive specific assignments in individual annual performance plans.
- 3. The process would then conclude with evaluation of  organizational and individual performance relative to the plans, thus renewing the planning cycle.

Civilian  Personnel Management System (CPMS)  XXI  is a  process  to determine the future Army civilian workforce needed to support Army XXI and AAN initiatives. The Army Secretariat, the Office of  the DCSOPS, and the ODCSPER led the CPMS XXI initiative. A formal charter for the CPMS XXI Process Action Team  (PAT)  and Executive Steering Committees  was established in FY  1998. The first  full  CPMS XXI PAT  meeting began the Army-wide  process  of analyzing  the  current  civilian  force  baseline  and defining future civilian workforce needs in a systematic manner. A second PAT meeting, addressing how to  integrate career program planning results with major command (MACOM) civilian forecasts for Table of  Distribution and  Allowances  into  Total Army  Analysis  (TAA),  also  took  place  in  FY 1998.  A  PAT  status  briefing  to  the CSA  through  his Leadership Advisory Group followed these meetings. In addition, the PAT participated in the first exercise to feed Table of  Distribution and Allowances requirements into TAl\ 2007. The analyses and evaluations arising from these activities resulted  in

development and refinement of  CPMS XXI concepts and methodologies by the end of  the fiscal year.

The Civilian Personnel Operations Center Management  Agency (CPOCMA) was  established  in  July  1997  to  provide management of the seven regional civilian personnel operations centers in the continental United States. The agency began operations in March 1998, occupying two renovated buildings at Aberdeen Proving Ground. In March 1998, the Army Center for Civilian Human Resource Management  in  Lancaster, Pennsylvania, relocated to Aberdeen Proving Ground and became the  Training Management Division under  the  CPOCMA.  The  division's new  facility,  part  of the  CPOCMA complex, included four state-of-the-art  classrooms in which  division personnel conducted functional,  leadership, and automation training for the Army's civilian personnel career employees. During the fiscal  year,  ninety› two  classes  were taught;  more  than  twenty-one hundred students attended at  locations  in  the continental  United States as well as  in Alaska,  Europe, and the Republic of Korea. The Training Management Division established a Web site, accessed  through  the  Civilian Personnel  Online Web  site,  that includes a course schedule,  a description of courses, and an online course application form.

By the end ofFY 1998, nine of  the ten regional Army Civilian Personnel Operations  Centers  (CPOCs)  were  fully  operational,  and  approximately 96  percent  of employees  were  receiving  regionalized  civilian  personnel services. The West CPOC at Fort Huachuca, Arizona,  began operations  in March 1998, serving employees in twelve states. The South Central CPOC, Huntsville,  Alabama, and the North  Central  CPOC,  Rock Island,  Illinois, reached full  operational capability  in  September 1998. The South Central CPOC serves nine MACOMs, with 35,527 employees in seven states; the North  Central  CPOC serves  three  MACOMs,  with  22,700  employees  in seven states. The CPOC Productivity Reporting System (CivPro) was fielded to  the CPOCs and the MACOMs in FY 1998. The first phase of  the CivPro implementationproviding counts of  completed actions by nature-of-action code-was online in  December 1997. To allow for historical analyses, the data  for  phase  I  dated  from  January  1993.  The  second  phase,  fielded  in August 1998, contained data on the timeliness of  completed recruit and fill actions, as well as counts of  the number of  recruit and fill actions entering and leaving the CPOCs. Data for phase II came from the Army PERSACTION automated personnel system, using records from October 1997 to the present. Programming for a third phase had begun at the end ofFY 1998. Phase Ill will extend the CivPro beyond recruit and fill actions, enabling it to track all actions in PERSACTION, and will  make the CivPro accessible through the World Wide Web.

Roles  and  responsibilities for human  resource  development  in  the regional CPOCs were established in FY 1998. A task list was approved and

distributed,  business process  maps were drawn to  show  the  flow  of core human resource development processes, and standard operating procedures were  put  into  final  form.  Two  classes  (622  participants  throughout  the Department of  Defense [DOD]) were selected for the Defense Leadership and Management Program, which was developed in  1997 to prepare and certify a cadre of  senior civilians DOD-wide. Forty-five Army employees (GS-14- 15) entered  the  1997  class  in  December  1997.  The  1998  class, selected in July 1998, included 112 Army employees (GS-13- 15). Women were 43 percent of the Army participants; minority representation was 27 percent.

The Army  civilian  personnel  community  continued  to  support  the modernization of the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). Army representatives  participated  in  requirements  development,  system testing,  and  infrastructure procurement and  installation. The  modernized system will support civilian personnel operations throughout the DOD. It will  support appropriated  fund,  nonappropriated fund, and local- national civilian  personnel  functions.  Managers,  personnel  specialists,  resource management officials, and others will use the DCPDS to achieve process improvements  that  support  directed  manpower  reductions  in  civilian personnel  operations.  The  modernization  of the  DCPDS  will  automate the initiation, coordination, and processing of  personnel transactions. The system will direct personnel actions applied to payrolls, provide automated tracking and management of  personnel actions, and supply  managers with information on employees. System qualification testing of  the modernized DCPDS began in July 1998. Completion was planned for September 1998, but the Office of  the Secretary of  Defense extended the test period to permit more thorough testing before deployment in the Army's Pacific region and in  other operational  testing  and  evaluation sites.  Full deployment of the modernized DCPDS is expected to occur in FY 2000.

Army science and technology  laboratories  continued  to  test civilian personnel  management  systems  and  programs.  Demonstration  projects were  implemented  in  FY  1998  at the  Medical  Research  and  Materiel Command, the Army Research Laboratory, and the Engineer Research and Development Center, thereby bringing the current number of  projects to five (covering a total of  7,400 civilians in a wide variety of  occupations). Work progressed on the DOD Acquisition Workforce Personnel Demonstration. The project  plan was  published in the Federal Register in  March  1998, and  public  hearings  followed.  implementation  is  projected  to  begin  in February  1999. This demonstration  project will  cover  a  total  of 14,817 civilian  employees,  including  1,758 Army civilians.  Initiatives  began  to develop an automated activity-based costing system that would determine costs of operational-level civilian human resources products and services. Activity-based costing would be used to improve efficiency and customer

service, and to support corporate business and policy decisions concerning civilian human resources and outsourcing competitions.

Headquarters,  DA  (HQDA)  designed  a  process  for  centralizing  the recruitment  of interns  through  the  Army  Civilian  Training,  Education, and Development  System  (ACTEDS)  during  FY  1998.  The  North Central  CPOC was  designated  to  become  the  total  service provider for the  recruitment of all  ACTEDS  interns.  HQDA  civilian  personnel  staff continued to make improvements to the online intern position description library this year. A new Web-based entry system was developed to enable the CPOCs to enter position descriptions in the database. This system also enabled Army civilian personnel staff to edit documents directly from the database.  Developers  installed an  online software demonstration of how the system functions to  instruct new users on  the features and policies of the library.

## Special Topics

The enhancement of opportunity  for women in the Army continued. Females accounted for  14.9 percent of the total Army  force in FY  1998, up  slightly  from  14.7  percent  in  FY  1997.  Women  were  16.3  percent of the  commissioned officers,  6.4  percent of warrant  officers,  and  13.7 percent of  en isted personnel. Among the enlisted females, whites were the I majority group (  46.0 percent), and blacks  were  the second largest group (  40.5  percent).  Integration of women  into  the expanded range of duties opened by the Secretary of Defense's new assignment rule and amended definition  of direct  ground  combat  in  FY  1994  continued.  In  response to  a  recommendation  by  the  Defense  Advisory  Committee  on  Women in  the  Services,  the  Army  began  to  study  the  feasibility  of opening  to women positions in special operations aviation and multiple launch rocket systems  units.  The ATmy  also defended its  practice of gender-integrated basic training,  implemented  on  a  large scale in FY  1994,  in the  face  of criticism from Congress and public interest groups. Gender resegregation was  presented  as  detrimental  to  readiness  and  contrary  to  established principles of  gender equity, and as a violation of  the axiom that units must train as they expect to fight.

In an effort to provide a better climate for women and minorities, the Army proceeded with a variety of equal opportunity and human relations initiatives in  FY  1998. Between January and September 1998, the Army sent  288  soldiers  of all  ranks  through  the  Defense  Equal  Opportunity Management  Institute. All currently assigned division, corps, and installation  commanders  have  attended  the  institute's  general  officer/ senior executive service course. The Army has  increased the  number of equal  opportunity  advisors  (EOAs)  assigned  to  units  to  ensure  that  all

units or brigade size and above will have trained EOAs available to assist soldiers and commanders. The Army has centralized the selection process for EOAs to ensure the selection of  top-quality soldiers for these positions. By this means the Army has sought to remove the perception that serving as an  EOA was not career-enhancing.  Promotion statistics  indicated  that high-quality soldiers were filling EOA positions; the percentage of EOAs promoted to  master sergeant  (E-8)  on  the  most recent promotion  board exceeded the Army average.

The Army established the Human Relations Action Plan in response to the findings of  the Inspector General Special Inspection of Initial Entry Training and the Senior Review Panel on Sexual Harassment in the wake of allegations  of sexual  harassment  at Aberdeen  Proving  Ground.  This action  plan  directs  Army  leaders  to  implement  those changes  necessary to  improve the human  relations  environment  in the Army.  The secretary of the  Army  promised  Congress  a  follow-up  study  after  the  plan  was implemented.

The most recent quarterly in-progress review for the Human Relations Action  Plan took place on  16  September  1998.  Both the  senior civilian and military leaders were pleased with the progress the Army has made in implementing this plan. The in-progress review process will be discontinued in FY 1999.  Instead of these reviews,  the ODCSPER will provide to the CSA and the secretary of the Army quarterly written reports through the assistant secretary of  the Army for manpower and reserve affairs. The Army has taken significant actions already to  implement the recommendations made by the reports of the inspector general and of the secretary of the Army's Senior Review  Panel  on Sexual  Harassment,  beginning with the methodology  used  by  the  review  panel.  Panelists  briefed  commanders before  leaving  the  locations  they  visited,  and these  exit briefings  started the process of human relations change in the Army.

The  Army has undertaken a variety of  other  initiatives to improve human relations within the service. The CSA published a  pamphlet, "Leadership and  Change  in  a  Values-Based  Army,"  that  reinforced  core  values  and leader responsibilities. Commanders at all levels received training on ways to establish a  healthy climate for human relations; they were also given a mandate to conduct a climate assessment within ninety days o[ assuming command and annually thereafter. Implementation of  the Human Relations Action Plan provided new tools to help leaders monitor the climate within their units and it offered standardized, improved, and expanded training in sexual-harassment prevention and equal opportunity, which was supplied through new training support packages developed by the Soldier Support Institute. The plan also called for a chain-teaching process throughout the Army to educate soldiers and leaders on the Army's policy and standards of behavior regarding sexual harassment and misconduct.

Institutionally,  implementation of the  Human  Relations Action  Plan created a new three-star general officer position for an additional deputy commander at the Training and Doctrine Command to focus on the teaching of  Army values and traditions. This teaching began by setting or modifying standards of  training in individual entry training. A variety of  other  training› related measures were put in place as well. Executive officers were assigned to advanced individual  training companies to  decrease the commanders' administrative workload.  In  addition, chaplains were assigned to training battalions  to  give  soldiers  another means  to  address  their problems. The Army extended basic combat training from eight weeks to nine weeks on 1 October 1998, so that new soldiers could be immersed in the Army's  seven core  values:  loyalty,  duty,  respect,  selfless  service,  honor,  integrity,  and personal courage. The additional fifty-four classroom hours of instruction in the added week stress the Army's  values and heritage and aim to promote teamwork, discipline, and knowledge of  Army heritage.

One-station unit training was lengthened by fifty-four hours. Soldiers going  through the  longer training are still required to meet standards in traditional training tasks, such as weapons qualification, theAnny physical fitness  test,  hand-grenade throwing,  and  road marching.  More thorough screening and selection of  prospective drill sergeants were implemented to ensure that only those soldiers best suited to lead and mentor new recruits would be assigned to drill sergeant duty. A pilot psychological screening program for  drill  sergeant candidates  was  implemented.  In  addition,  the Army  approved  three  drill  sergeant  incentives:  assignment  preferences for soldiers completing drill sergeant duty; an increased emphasis on drill sergeant assignment as a positive criterion for consideration by promotion boards;  and  a  $275-per-month  increase  in  drill  officers'  special-duty assignment pay for the entire year, rather than only during basic training cycles.

The  Consideration  of Others  Program,  implemented  throughout  the Army in FY 1998, is designed to heighten soldier and leader awareness of and skills in areas relating to the human dimensions of  combat readiness. The Human Resources Directorate, ODCSPER, published a Consideration of Others Handbook for use throughout the Army. The  program is based on the premise that subjects in this area are best addressed by small-group instruction emphasizing the responsibility of  the soldier as a member of a military team. The  specific content of Consideration of Others lessons is based on a commander's assessment of  his or her command's needs. EOAs arc key participants in this program. Existing EOAs were provided training in December 1997 at the Major Command Equal Opportunity Conference. The  entire  150-page  Consideration  of Others  Handbook  was  placed  on the ODCSPER Web site for Internet access throughout the force.  Newly assigned EOAs are being trained on the Consideration of  Others Program

during the Army-specific portion of the EOA course at the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute.

The Army  is  distributing  to  all  soldiers  wallet  cards  and  neck tags listing  the  Army  valuesloyalty,  duty,  respect,  selfless  service,  honor, integrity, and personal courage. A DA message of  29 July  1998 prescribed the  manner in  which  the Army values  wallet card  and  identification  tag would be issued and subsequently carried or worn. Company commanders or  first sergeants were directed to lead a discussion of  or make a presentation to their companies on the importance of  living by Army values as soldiers. They then were told to issue the cards and tags to each soldier, who in turn would sign the card in front of  their company commander or first sergeant. Soldiers carry the signed Army values cards with them and wear the Army values  tags  along  with  their  identification  tags  at  all  times.  The Active Army has a  suspense of 30 October  1998  and  the  Reserve  and  National Guard a suspense of l February 1999 to complete distribution of  cards and tags.  A  total of 1,200,000 cards were distributed to the Active Army,  the Army Reserve, and the National Guard.

Accomplishment  of the  Alcohol  and  Drug  Abuse  Prevention  and Control Program (ADA  PCP) mission was made mandatory Army-wide in FY J 998. At HQDA, the deputy chief of staff for personnel  became the overall proponent of the ADAPCP. Within the ODCSPER, the director of human resources, who is also the director of  the Army Center for Substance Abuse Program, had the leadership role. He coordinated with the surgeon general and commander of  the U.S. Army Medical Command to establish ADAPCP policy in the manner specified in AR 600-85, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program (I May 1978).

During  FY  1998,  the  ADAPCP  enrolled  9,832  individuals  in  the treatment program.  Of this  number,  8,592  (87.39  percent)  were  active› duty soldiers, whereas the remaining  I ,240 ( 12.61 percent) fell into other eligibility  categories:  Reserve,  Guard,  federal  civilian employees,  Army retirees,  and  cadets.  For 80.31  percent of enrollees, alcohol  misuse  was the reason for entrance into the program, whereas cannabis use accounted for 11.60 percent and cocaine use was the third-most frequent reason (3.71 percent).  Other drugs  (amphetamines,  hallucinogens,  inhalants,  opiates, phencyclidine, and sedatives) combined to account for the remaining 4.38 percent of  enrollments. Self-referrals produced 26.57 percent of  ADAPCP cases,  commander or supervisor  referrals  were  22.45  percent,  referrals involving charges of  driving under the influence of  alcohol or driving while impaired  were  15.34  percent,  and  biochemical  testing  produced  13.20 percent of the  referrals. The remaining 22.44 percent of  ADAPCP  cases arose from other sources, including medical referral and law enforcement investigation  or  apprehension.  Individuals  who  were  screened  and  not enrolled  in  the  ADA  PCP  totaled  8,1 06.  Of that  number,  4,453  (54.93

## PERSONNEL

percent) were referred to the ADAPCP remedial Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Training Program. Of  the I ,076,361 urinalysis specimens taken from  active-duty soldiers, 8,682 specimens tested positive, for a  positive rate of  0.81  percent.

Worldwide  Army  commitments  frequently  produce  unusual and unpredictable personnel demands. The ODCSPER Personnel Contingency Cell  (PCC) monitored,  coordinated,  and directed personnel activities  for numerous significant activities and events during FY 1998. Operations and contingencies that the  PCC supported included Operations JOINT  GUARD and JOINT  FoRGE in European Command (all year); Operation SOUTHERN WATCII in Central Command (February- June 1998, including activation of a Crisis Action Team in the PCC from 16 February to 2 March 1998); U.S. Support Group Haiti in  Southern Command (all year); Joint Task Force› Bravo  in  Southern  Command (all  year); and Military Observer Mission Ecuador and  Peru in Southern Command (all  year). Table  10  shows  the approximate number of  individual augmentation requests processed by the PCC in response to contingencies in FY 1998.

The PCC also supported a variety of  exercises (planning and execution of POSITIVE RESPONSE  98  [15- 24 October  1997),  planning  for  POSITIVE RESPONSE  99  [subsequently  canceled),  and  POSITIVE  RESPONSE  Y2K), exercises  testing  contingency  plans  for  Army  information  systems,  and planning and  execution  of HQDA  command-post exercise MINIEX  98-1 (28- 30 September 1998).

a. Includes  United  Nations,  joint,  special  operations  forces,  and  military  support  to  civilian agencies.

The secretary of the Army is the DOD executive agent responsible for repatriation  plans  and  operations  in  connection  with  the  return  of DOD noncombatant evacuees. The secretary, in  turn, delegates this responsibility to  the  deputy chief of stafT for personnel.  Repatriation,  the  final  stage  in noncombatant evacuation,  is  the official  processing  of American  citizens back  into the United  States  after  their  evacuation  from overseas. As executive agent, the Army directs repatriation operations within the DOD by coordinating with the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, the U.S. Transportation Command, and the geographic commanders in chief, and it coordinates with the State Department and other federal, state, and  local agencies in planning for  the reception and onward movement of U.S.  citizens and designated aliens to  the continental United States, Hawaii, and Alaska.

The  Army's repatriation  plans  directly  support  the  evacuation  plans developed by each theater commander. The executive agent for repatriation operations  has  designated  specific  installations  and  bases  throughout  the United  States as repatriation centers to process DOD military and  civilian family  members  as  well  as  private  citizens  and  third-country  nationals. During the planning of  an evacuation, the DOD executive agent meets with and advises other federal agencies as to which repatriation center or centers will  be  activated  to  receive  evacuees.  Based  on  the  situation,  repatriating personnel  may  return  by  commercial  flights  to  multiple  aerial  ports  of debarkation instead of  repatriating en masse to or tlu·ough a single designated continental U.S. repatriation site.

Evacuation  activity  increased  significantly  this  fiscal  year.  Nineteen posts were evacuated in FY  1998 (compared with eight posts in FY 1997): Kinshasa,  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  (October 1997); Dushanbe, Tajikistan  (November  1997);  Jerusalem,  Israel  (February  1998);  Kuwait (February 1998); Tel Aviv, Israel (February 1998);  Togo (April 1998); Jakatta, Indonesia (May  1998); Asmara, Eritrea (June  1998);  Guinea-Bissau  (June 1998); Dares Salaam, Tanzania (August 1998); Islamabad, Pakistan (August 1998); Karachi, Pakistan (August 1998); Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (August  1998, second  instance);  Lahore,  Pakistan  (August  1998); Nairobi,  Kenya  (August  1998); Peshawar, Pakistan (August  1998); Tirana, Albania  (August  1998); Momovia, Liberia (September  1998);  and Phnom Penh,  Cambodia  (September  1998).  The  majority  of these  evacuations resulted from the high threat of  terrorism or direct terrorist attack (ten posts). Only the evacuation of  the four posts in Pakistan in September 1998 required the  establishment  of a  continental  U.S.  repatriation  site.  The  evacuations during  FY  1998  consisted  primarily  of small  numbers of dependents and nonessential personnel leaving under individually arranged travel itineraries. Only one evacuation during FY 1998, the evacuation ofEritrea in June 1998 as  a  consequence  of its  border  dispute  with  Ethiopia,  required  military

assistance:  In this  case,  U.S.  Marine ground  forces  and  aircraft evacuated 172 American citizens and third-country nationals from Asmara, Eritrea, to Amman, Jordan, as a precautionary measure.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint  for the Future

In FY  1998, the U.S.  Army continued in its efforts to exploit advances in  information technology  to  achieve  the Army Vision  201 0  objective  of full-spectrum  dominance:  the  ability of U.S.  forces,  operating unilaterally or in  combination  with  multinational  and  interagency  partners,  to  defeat any  adversary  and  control  any  situation across  the  full  range  of military operations. The  Army's  initiative, called Force XXI, focuses on digitization› the application of  digital information technologies to acquire, exchange, and employ data throughout the battlespace.

Digitization  enables warfighters  to  share  critical  situational understanding and command-and-control information, thus reducing many of  the constraints imposed by hierarchical military organization. This capability would allow U.S.  and allied forces  to share a constantly updated common view of both friendly  and enemy dispositions on the  battlefield.  Digitized  forces  could exploit this advantage to maneuver with greater speed and decisiveness than any undigitized adversary, exploiting enemy vulnerabilities while removing their own  vulnerabilities  from  the compass of hostile action.  Digitization is  not a  program in  the traditional acquisition sense;  rather,  it is a strategy to  integrate  advanced  command-and-control  systems,  weapons  systems, the  training  of the  soldiers operating  these systems,  and the  doctrine  for employing them. The digitization process involves upgrading or modifying some existing  systems;  adding  a  supplementary  "applique"  capability  to others;  and  ensuring  that  future  systems  have  information  technologies "embedded," or built in, as an integral part of  the system, when appropriate. Digitized  systems  will  be developed  in  compliance  with  a  common  set of standards,  ensuring  interoperability  and  enhancing  efficiency  through reuse of software developed for other applications. The Army's strategy for digitization includes experimentation, evaluation, and acquisition intended to equip the first digitized division, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, by the end of  FY 2000 and the first digitized corps by the end of  FY 2004. As of the end of FY  1998, the total cost of the digitization effort in FY 2000 is projected to be $2.8  billion, a part of the Army total obligation

authority  to  existing  programs.  This  expense  does  not  include  program costs, such as those for the MIA! Abrams tank and M2A2 Bradley fighting vehicle;  rather,  it includes  only  the  cost of integrating digital  technologies into these platforms.

The Chief  of  Staff, Army, approved the Army  Experimentation Campaign Plan (AECP) in May 1998  to capitalize on the successes of the Task Force XXI and  Division advanced  warfighting experiments (AWEs). The AECP encompasses three force-design effortsfor future  mechanized forces,  light forces,  and "strike forces" (replacements for existing armored cavalry regiments)with the intents of  achieving Army XXI goals as well as developing the capabilities required to  field the Army After Next (AAN) in the 2015- 25 period. AECP efforts are consistent with Army modernization goals of  digitizing the force, sustaining essential research and development, and focusing development for radically advanced information technologies to  equip  the  AAN.  Already,  the  Force  XXI  Battle  Command  Brigade› and-Below  limited  user test  in  August  1998  has demonstrated significant improvement over results gained in the Task Force XXI A  WE.

The  Army has continued to pursue efforts with the other  services and with allies to ensure interoperability and seamless communications throughout the battlespace. In FY 1998, a  joint  contingency force (JCF)  AWE was planned for September 2000, focusing on crisis response and rapid deployment. The JCF AWE objectives are to improve the effectiveness ofC4ISR command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for a joint task force (JTF) through digitization, enhanced communications, and interoperability of systems, processes, and procedures. The JCF AWE is  also  intended  to  enhance  the  conduct  of JTF  operations  in  urban  and restricted terrain. Additionally, the JCF AWE would facilitate identification of  new systems or linkages that increase JTF lethality and survivability in the austere suppott conditions of  rapid-deployment operations while expanding the  battlespace  by  using  advanced  sensors  in  restricted  terrain.  The  JCF AWE will  serve as  a venue  for joint experimentation  in  conjunction with U.S. Atlantic Command's (ACOM's)  joint experimentation process.

## Force Development

The Army announced  a  new  structure  for  its  heavy  divisions  in June 1998; corresponding designs for new army corps, light divisions, and strike forces  are  to  follow.  The  previous  standard  heavy  division  had  18,069 soldiers  in  its  mechanized  variant and  17,832  in  its  armored  variant.  The new divisional organization, called Division XXI,  includes  15,812  for  the mechanized  division  variant (  15,299  active component  [AC],  513  reserve component [RC]) and  15,593 for the armored division variant (15,080 AC, 513 RC). As with previous heavy division structures, the two division types

will share a common division base; however, the  mechanized division  will have five mechanized infantry batt  a ions and four armor battalions in its three I maneuver brigades, whereas the armored variant will have four mechanized infantry and five armor battalions. Division XXI has been designed to conduct distributed  operations  to  seize  and  maintain  the  operational  initiative,  to defeat enemy  forces,  and  to  control  populations and  terrain. The Division XXI  force  design  takes  advantage  of the  increased  situational  awareness offered by digitization to improve the synergy inherent in the combined-arms team.  Improved situational awareness enables maneuver forces to  move to points  of positional advantage  with  greater speed and  precision, avoiding enemy strengths, and then to  combine effects of  direct and  indirect fire  to achieve their objectives.

The Army designated the 4th Infantry Division as lhe experimental force for digitized armored and mechanized operations. The division serves as the Army's experimental unit for  new ideas in the areas of doctrine,  training, leader  development,  organizations,  materiel,  and  soldiers  and  the  testing of information technologies. It spent much of FY 1998 conducting tests in support  of  heavy-division redesign and digitization. As  ofthe  end ofFY 1998, the 4th Infantry Division was  scheduled to conduct a two-phased division capstone  exercise  in  FY  2001  to  demonstrate  its  warfighting  capability. The exercise calls for a live brigade-level National Training Center (NTC) rotation at Fort Irwin, California, in March 2001 and a computer-based Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) warfighter exercise at Fort Hood later in 2001.

## Training

The  1997  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  recommended  that man-days allotted  for  joint exercises decrease  by  15  percent  between FY  1996  and FY 1998 to ease the high personnel tempo of  U.S.  forces and improve force management. The FY99 Defense Planning Guidance therefore directed the services  to  reduce  man-days  for  chairman,  Joint Chiefs  of Staff (CJCS), exercises  by  15  percent  from  the FY96  level.  In  formulating  the  FY992003  Program  Objective  Memorandum,  the  Army  reduced  funding  for CJCS exercises  to  comply  with the Quadrennial  Defense Review  and  the Defense Planning Guidance. Over the past two years, the unified commands have been working with  their service components to reduce CJCS exercise man-days.  Since  1996, Army participation in the CJCS exercises has been reduced.  The  most  significant  reductions  have  been  in  large-scale  field› training exercises, which have been replaced by computer-assisted exercises. Army commands frequently participate in these computer-assisted exercises from home station, further reducing deployment days.  During FY 1998, the Army continued efforts to  reduce deployment demands on unit personnel.

The Army cut the number of  rotations conducted at combat training centers and  continued  to  develop  a  family  of simulations  that  would  minimize the amount of field  training required  to  sustain readiness of the combined arms forces.  Nonetheless, the pace of operational and training deployments challenged active Army  units, so RC  units were increasingly used to  meet these requirements.

Despite these pressures, the combat training center program conducted an extensive array of activities. The BCTP,  which provides combat training for brigade, division, corps, and higher joint-force commanders and staffs at their home stations, conducted four AC division warfighter exercises, tlu·ee computer-based embedded warfighter exercises, and thit1een National Guard brigade warfighter exercises. The  BCTP also conducted six joint exercises. Significant activities included a mission rehearsal exercise for the 1st Cavalry Division to support deployment for the DESERTTI lUNDER Joint Coalition Task Force operating  in  Kuwait.  Preparations  began  for  the FUERTAS  DEFENSAS proof-of-principle  exercise  to  be  conducted  as  part  of a  larger  inclusive warfighter exercise for XVIII Corps.

The Combat Maneuver Training Center Hohenfels, Germany, conducted five U.S. and four allied training rotations. Significant events included training the  1st Armored Division for contingency operations to take over the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Stabilization Force (SFOR) mission in Bosnia. The Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC), Fort Polk,  Louisiana, executed  ten  rotations  in  FY  1998,  including  one Army  National  Guard, one  U.S.  Army Pacific Command,  and one  U.S.  Army  Special Operations Command. Also, one mission rehearsal exercise was conducted  for the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment in preparation for deployment to  Bosnia to take over SFOR duties. FY98 JRTC rotations included reciprocal unit exchanges with Australia, Germany, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom. Over time, the JRTC focus on training light infantry for force-on-force confiicts has shifted significantly. In  FY  1998,  scenario  development placed  greater  emphasis on peacekeeping and current operational issues, with increased numbers of civilians on the battlefield.

The NTC, Fort Irwin,  California,  conducted nine rotations. The tenth rotation in the year's schedule was cancelled when the 3d Infantry Division was selected  for deployment to  Kuwait.  In August  1998, the NTC  hosted a  rotation  focusing  on  the  engineer  Bradley  fighting  vehicle.  The  lO 1st Airborne Division (Air Assault) conducted  its  first NTC rotation  in  more than  ten  years  in  November  1997.  In  the  rotation,  an  aviation  brigade headquarters served as the controlling headquarters for the first time in an NTC rotation.  In FY  1998, the  total  number of scheduled rotations at the NTC was reduced from twelve to ten (nine active rotations and one National Guard rotation), and the NTC conducted a test of  a thirty-one- day rotation. The NTC Opposing Force (OPFOR) commenced replacement of  its existing

BMP-2 surrogate with the new OPFOR surrogate vehicle. The older vehicle was  an  M551  armored  reconnaissance/airborne  assault  vehicle  visually modified  to  resemble  the  Russian  BMP-2  infantry  combat  vehicle.  The M551 is passing out of  the Army inventory; therefore, the OPFOR surrogate vehicle, based on  the currently serving M 113  armored personnel carrier, is being substituted.

The Army sought to expand its training areas in FY 1998. A requirement existed for additional land at  Fort  Irwin.  The  Army considered withdrawal  from public domain or purchase of  approximately 330,000 acres on the northeast boundary of the  installation,  or withdrawal  or  purchase of approximately 260,000 acres on the southern boundary. The Bureau of  Land Management, Department of  the Interior, prepared the required environmental documents. At Fort Polk, the Army worked on obtaining a special-use permit from  the U.S.  Forest Service at no cost to allow intensive training activities on forty› five  thousand acres of Kisatchie National Forest. This area  is  located south of  the installation and was in a limited-use category. Fort Polk has prepared an  environmental  assessment,  with  the  Forest  Service  as  a  cooperating agency,  to  accommodate  intensive  training.  Completion of the assessment is  anticipated  in  September  1999.  At McGregor Range,  Fort Bliss, Texas (609,305 acres); Yukon Maneuver Area, Fort Wainwright, Alaska (247,952 acres); and  the Maneuver Area at Fort Greely, Alaska (  661,341  acres),  the Army has been using land under withdrawals from public domain that expire in 200 1.  The Army  has  completed  draft environmental  impact  statements and  has  submitted  requests for renewal  of the existing  withdrawals to the Bureau of  Land Management The Army expects to send final environmental impact statements for the renewals to Congress in April  1999. At Kahuku Training  Area,  Schofield  Barracks,  Hawaii,  the  Army  has  been  leasing approximately eight thousand acres at an annual rent of$936,000. Congress funded acquisition of the land  for FY 1999 as a congressional addition of $23.5 million, with completion anticipated in February  1999.

The Army sought to improve virtual as well as physical training facilities. The service has engineered a consensus-based process for developing  and promulgating modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) standards. The Army Model and Simulation  Master Plan of October  1997  formalized  the process  for development of  Army M&amp;S standards. Under this plan, teams of experts from government, industry, and academia identified standardization requirements in  nineteen  different M&amp;S  areas.  The teams  then constructed and refined standards and submitted them to  senior Army and Department of Defense (DOD)  experts  for  review  and  approval.  In June  1998,  the  process  was largely  automated using a Web-based tool that facilitated  nomination  and review of proposed standards. Approved M&amp;S standards were then housed in  a  central,  Web-based  repository  called  the Army Standards Repository System  (available  at http://www.msrr.army.mil/astars/),  where  they  were

easily accessible to simulation developers and M&amp;S users. These approved standards provided a solid foundation for development of  future simulations, thus making the verification and validation process faster and simpler. Initial efforts to  identify and exploit existing products that show promise for reuse have  focused  on the  training exercises and on  the  military operations and advanced  concepts as  well  as  the  requirements  domains.  In  addition,  the Army Model and Simulation Office initiated a concerted effort to encourage program  managers  to  identify  M&amp;S-related  problems  tending  to  increase costs and then to develop M&amp;S standards to address them.

The  Army  received  its  first  close  combat  tactical  trainer  (CCTT)  at Fort Hood, Texas, in June  1998. The CCTT is a  network ofMlAl, MIA2, and M2A2 simulators that facilitates armor and  infantry collective training up  to  the  company  and  learn  level.  All  of the  battle  operating  systems, including combat support and combat service support, are also present in semiautomated forces form.  Semiautomated forces are computer-generated friendly and enemy forces used to complete a realistic battlefield simulation, which  gives  the  CCTT  an  additional  capability  for  battalion  task  force training. The CCTT is the lead program to modernize fully the Army's  virtual training capability.

## Deployed Forces

During  FY 1998, the  Army had a daily average  of28,420  soldiers deployed in seventy-six  countries  to  conduct  joint  and  combined  operations  and training exercises. While the Army trained to fight two nearly simultaneous major  theater  wars,  it  also  conducted  many  concurrent,  smaller-scale contingency  and  support  operations.  In  ACOM,  approximately  sixteen hundred soldiers participated in various counterdrug missions in California, Florida,  and Texas. The missions  included several  engineering  projects, such  as  upgrading  roads,  constructing  fences,  and  installing  stadium lighting.  Other missions  included air reconnaissance, transportation, and intelligence analysis.

In  November  1997,  three  hundred  soldiers  from  the  staffs  of the  3d Brigade,  40th  Infantry  Division,  California  Army  National  Guard,  and subordinate  battalions  participated  in PEACESIIIELD 97,  a  joint,  bilateral, computer-assisted exercise designed  to  expand  the scope of Ukraine-U.S. military  relations  and  enhance  interoperability  tlu·ough  the  practice  of combined peacekeeping operations  at the  brigade  level. Purm,E DRAGON 98  was  conducted  in  January and  February  1998  as  part of ACOM's JTF exercise  series.  The exercise  centered  on  the certification  for  deployment of a  carrier battle group and an  amphibious ready group, joint-force entry operations, and joint ground combat operations. Army participants included approximately  I  0,500 soldiers from  the XVIII Airborne Corps and the U.S.

Army Special  Operations  Command. The area of operations  included  the entire eastern seaboard, from Virginia to Puerto Rico. Land maneuver areas were concentrated around Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Exercise ROVING  SANDS  98  (14-26 April  1998)  was a joint tactical  air operations field training exercise, scheduled by the ACOM and sponsored by Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). The exercise, emphasizing ground› based  air  and  missile  defense,  employed  Army,  Air  Force,  and  Marine Corps elements, along with allied  forces  from  France,  Germany,  Holland, and  the  United  Kingdom.  The area  of operations was more  than fourteen thousand square  miles of military installations and  training ranges at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range. ROVING  SANDS 98, recognized as the world's largest joint air defense training  exercise,  involved  approximately five  thousand U.S. Army soldiers from the  11th, 31st, and 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigades; the 1st Uattalion (Theater High Altitude Area Defense), 6th Air Defense Artillery Brigade; and the 16th and 40th Signal Battalions.

During June 1998, the FORSCOM deployed approximately 540 soldiers from  the  Florida Army National Guard and 30 soldiers  from  the Georgia Army National Guard to fight wildfires in  Florida. The president declared the entire state of  Florida a federal disaster area and directed the Department of  Defense to render support. The FORSCOM was designated the executive agent for the Army for this operation and was given authority to directACOM service component commanders to deploy forces for the firefighting effort.

The  U.S.  Central  Command  (CENTCOM)  carried  out  a  variety  of operations and exercises with  Army involvement. Operation DESERT FALCON, the air and missile defense mission in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, continued throughout FY 1998; task forces rotated approximately every four months. Operation DESERT Focus, the force protection mission in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,  commenced  in  the  wake of the 25  June  1996  truck-bombing by terrorists of  the U.S. military compound at KhobarTowers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,  and continued  through  FY  1998.  Operation  SOUTHERN  WATCH,  a multinational joint operation  with  forces  deployed  throughout  Southwest Asia, continued to enforce the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq. The CENTCOM has supported this operation since Aprill99l and has maintained a forward presence in Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.

INTRINSIC  ACTION is a combined  field-training  exercise,  with  near› continuous  presence,  conducted  with  Kuwaiti  host-nation  forces.  When rotated  to  the  exercise,  the  participating  U.S.  element,  a  heavy  battalion task force, routinely employs combat equipment from Army pre-positioned stocks in Kuwait. INTRINSIC ACTION increases regional stability and serves as a visible deterrent to potential regional aggression. The Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) is a multinational peacekeeping operation established by a 3 August 1981  protocol to the 26 March 1979 treaty of  peace between Egypt  and Israel. The MFO has operated checkpoints, reconnaissance patrols,

and observation  posts along the  international  bounda1y  to  observe,  report on, and periodically verify the implementation of  the treaty provisions. U.S. participation in  the MFO mission consists of one infantry and one support battalion. Battalion-sized task forces of  approximately 530  personnel rotate  approximately  every  six  months.  The  CENTCOM  has  conducted BRIGIIT STAR , a joint combined training exercise in Egypt, every two years. Approximately four thousand U.S. Army soldiers participated in this exercise during October 1997.

The  CENTCOM  llumanitarian  Demining Program was designed to  assist  designated  countries  with  funding,  equipment,  and  training  for demining  operations;  mine-awareness  education;  and  development  of a permanent infrastructure  to  dispose  of hazardous land mines.  During  FY 1998,  the  CENTCOM  commnnder  in  chief established  a  special  forces liaison team  to rotate  between Eritrea and Ethiopia  from February through September to coordinate efforts between the host nations, diplomatic teams from  the  U.S.  embassy  in  each country,  and  the CENTCOM.  In addition, during FY 1998, a CENTCOM civil affairs liaison team deployed to Yemen. The team coordinated with Yemeni and embassy officials to assist with the infrastructure and training for the Y emen demining program.

The European Command (EUCOM) conducted extensive operations in the Balkans  in FY  1998.  Soldiers from the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment continued the  Operation JOINT GUARD mission through  June 1998.  The purpose of  JOINT GUARD was to sustain peace and stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina by deterring a resumption of  hostilities, promoting a climate in which the peace process could proceed, and assisting in selected  areas of  civi  I implementation. The specific  tasks  of the  security  forces  included  patrolling  the  zone  of separation, monitoring the militaries of  the former warring factions through oversight of their movement and training, and enforcing the Bosnian no-fly zone.  In Operation  JOINT FORGE,  the  North Atlantic  Council  authorized  a slightly smaller  successor force in June 1998 to  deter  a resumption  ofhostilities and continue stabilizing  the peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Soldiers of the lst Armored  Division  have  been assigned this  mission.  MOUNTAIN  EAGLE VI, a company-level situational training exercise and field  training exercise held by the U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) and V Corps from 1 to  15 May 1998 at Hohenfels, Germany, constituted a mission rehearsal exercise for the 2d Brigade,  lst Armored Division, as part of its preparation to  replace the 2d Armored Cavalry Regiment in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The brigade trained in simulated peacekeeping and peace enforcement situations to develop the special  skills  necessary  for  successfttlly  conducting  operations  in  Bosnia› Herzegovina.  Task  Force  AOLE SENTRY  was  the  U.S.  contribution  to  the United Nations (UN)  Preventive Deployment (UNPREDEP) peacekeeping mission in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; task forces rotated approximately every six months. The UN Security Council extended the UN

mandate for the UNPREDEP until February 1999. Operation BALKAN CALM was the EUCOM's contribution to the joint DOD and Department of State observer teams in the Serbian province of Kosovo, operating as part of  the Kosovo diplomatic observer mission. Twelve EUCOM personnel (including one USAREUR officer) deployed to Kosovo on 7 August 1998.

STRONG  RESOLVE  (March  1998)  is  a  NATO  exercise  with  a  strong USAREUR component  designed  to  test contingency  deployment  of the Allied  Command Europe  Mobile Force,  its  affiliated  multinational  force, and the NATO Composite Force to NATO's Northern Contingency Area in Nmway.  STRONG  RESOLVE  marked  the first  UN  participation  in  a  regional training exercise. In supporting this effmt, the UN helped create the mission environment for the participants by providing civilian and military personnel to fill  key exercise positions, ensuring that the UN's  unique and multinational nature  was  incorporated  into  the  training  event.  The  exercise  included presentations by UN training assistance teams personnel on issues ranging from logistics to the coordination of  humanitarian operations.

USAREUR also  carried  out  missions  in  Africa.  The  African  Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) is a EUCOM  program that uses U.S. special forces mobile training teams  to  conduct  initial  training of one  infantry  battalion and its associated combat support and combat service support units in each participating African nation. The state department established the ACRI in 1996  to  develop  an African-manned  and  -led  response  force  for  regional contingencies,  such  as  humanitarian  relief operations  and  peacekeeping operations,  and  thereby  to  reduce  the  burdens  on  U.S.  resources.  Army special operations forces, augmented by engineers and medical and logistics persoMel  as  required, conducttraining  of  units fi·omselectedAfrican  countries in  UN-approved  humanitarian  relief and  peacekeeping  tasks.  The  initial eight to ten weeks of  training culminate in a battalion field-training exercise. Sustainment training occurs later and  prepares the units for incorporation into multinational operations. Thirty- to sixty-person mobile training teams deployed  to  Benin,  Cote  d'lvoire,  Ghana,  Malawi,  Mali,  Senegal,  and Uganda during FY 1998 as part of  the ACRI. The U.S. Department of  State provided funds for the equipment and training. The EUCOM Humanitarian Demining Operations Program conducted missions in Chad, Mozambique, Namibia,  Rwanda,  and  Zimbabwe  during  FY  1998.  USAREUR's 30th Medical Brigade deployed a  twenty-person  forward  surgical support team and a seven-person combat stress control team to Nairobi, Kenya, in support of Operation RESOLUTE  RESPONSE.  Their mission was  to  provide  medical assistance to U.S.  citizens and Kenyan  nationals in the  aftermath of the  7 August 1998 terrorist bombing of  the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.

USAREUR also  took  part  in  operations  in  the  Mediterranean  Basin and Southwest Asia. NOBLE SAFEGUARD is a joint air defense task force,  led by USAREUR, that was formed to respond to specific contingencies in the

Mediterranean region. The  task force  includes  both command-and-control and air defense elements drawn from V Corps, which deployed to the Persian Gulf region  in FY 1998 to augment CENTCOM theater air defenses. The Beirut Air Bridge, a joint  operation including USAREUR elements, ended in mid-August 1998 after having provided aviation support to the U.S. embassy in Beirut since 1984. NORTHERN WATCH, a multinational combined task force with  headquarters  in  lncirlik, Turkey,  has  the  mission of  enforcing the no› fly  zone in  Northern Iraq.  During FY 1998, the USAREUR supported the combined task force commander by providing sixteen soldiers to augment the NORTI !ERN WATCH staff and one C- 12 aircraft with two pilots for command aviation support.  USAREUR  support to NORTHERN  W  ATCII  began in April 199 I. The  task  force  activities  have  been  carried  out  in  concert  with  the CENTCOM's corresponding SOUTIIERN WATCH operations in  the southern no-fly zone. In Operation PROVIDE CovER, Atlantic and European Commands provide Patriot air defense task forces (750 soldiers) on a rotational basis to the commander in chief,  CENTCOM, for contingency employment in the that command's area of  responsibility.  Rotations normally last from four to six  months, with the  USAREUR  responsible  for every third  rotation. The USAREUR's 6th  Battalion,  52d  Air  Defense Artj))ery,  69th  Air Defense Artillery Brigade, was certified by the brigade commander on 18 May 1998 and assumed the mission on  1 June 1998.

The Army  took part  in  several joint  and  combined  operations  in  the Pacifi. c  Command  (PACOM)  during  FY  1998.  Army  civic  action  teams provided socioeconomic assistance to the Federated States ofMicronesia and to Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands through a variety of  construction and engineering projects along with programs  for  apprenticeship training, community relations, and medical  civic action. The teams consisted of  soldiers from  the  84th Engineer Battalion, 25th Infantry Division,  and  the  Special Troop  Battalion,  U.S.  Army,  Alaska.  Army  forces  provided  humanitarian assistance  to  several countries. The forces repaired a  pier and constructed a  community sanitation  facility  in the Marshall Islands, provided training expertise  to  several  civilian  medical  clinics  and  hospitals  tlu·oughout the Solomon Islands and in Sri Lanka, and constructed a multipurpose building in Tonga.  Joint Task Force-Full  Accounting  was  a joint investigation and recovery operation in Laos and Vietnam. Technical representatives of  Laos, the  Socialist  Republic  of Vietnam,  and  the  United  States  conducted joint investigations  and  remains  recovery  operations  pertaining to Americans unaccounted for from  the Vietnam War.

In  addition  to  these  operations,  elements  of the  U.S.  Army,  Pacific, participated in a number of  joint and combined exercises. Most important of these were the annual PACOM Joint Chiefs of  Staff (JCS) exercises, ULCHI Focus  LENS,  FOAL  EAGLE,  and the reception,  staging,  onward  movement, and integration exercise in  Korea, as well as ORIENT SHIELD  in Japan. Other

major but non-JCS exercises conducted  in Japan in  FY  1998  by  the U.S. Army,  Pacific,  were YAM/\  SAKURA,  KEJZN  EDGE,  and  NORTHWIND.  During FY 1998, U.S.  Army forces  in the  PACOM participated in joint combined exchange training programs in several countries, including Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Tonga.

In the Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), U.S. Army, South, took part in a variety of  operations and exercises in FY 1998. Operation SJ\FE BoRDER continued to provide support to the Military Observer Mission Ecuador and Peru (MOMEP) in the  disputed  region between the two nations. Originally, the support to the MOMEP was to be of  ninety days'  duration, but because of  the success of  the operation, it  was extended indefinitely. Exercise NEW  HORIZONS is  a  reserve component humanitarian civic assistance exercise designed to enhance  the  mission-essential  task  list  skills  of palticipating  units  while contributing to the improvement of  designated countries'  infrastructure. This exercise has been conducted annually in the Bahamas, Ecuador, E1 Salvador, Honduras. and Jamaica. Exercise FUERZAS ALIAD/\S was a joint  and combined command post exercise  designed  to  facilitate  multinational  disaster-relief training for crisis action teams in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. Approximately 329 personnel from Central American and Caribbean island nations and  approximately one hundred U.S. Army soldiers participated in this  exercise.  Exercise TRADEWINDS  98  was a joint and combined training exercise  sponsored  by  the  U.S.  Army  South  (USARSO).  The  exercise consisted of four phases:  maritime,  ground  force,  disaster command post exercise,  and security field  training exercise.  Units  from  the USARSO, the Special Operations Command South (SOCSOUTH), the U.S.  Coast Guard, the United Kingdom Royal Marines, the Regional Security System, and the Caribbean Community participated in TRADEWINDS 98.

## Army Special Operations Forces

Composing nearly 70 percent of the DOD's special operations  forces (SOF)  personnel,  Army  Special  Operations  Forces  (ARSOF)  consist  of special  forces,  Rangers, special operations aviation, civil affairs  (CA), and psychological operations (PSYOP) units. During FY 1998, 31,572 ARSOF soldiers  deployed  on  operations  and  training  exercises  to  112  countries around the world.

In Bosnia, the SOF mission for  Operations JOINT ENDEAVOR  and JOINT GuARD  has  been to  conduct special forces,  civil affairs,  and  psychological operations  in  support of the NATO  forces to deter hostilities and promote a stable  environment  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This  mission  has been accomplished  by  attaching  ARSOF  to  designated  NATO  and  non-NATO units,  where they  perform liaison with  former warring  factions;  assist the integration of all  units;  assist in  the implementation of peace accords; and

provide a rapid response capability for combat search and rescue, personnel recovery, special reconnaissance, and direct action.  Units were subordinate to the NATO  Stabilization  Force  through  the  Combined  Joint  Special Operations Task  Force  (CJSOTF),  although  PSYOP  and  CA forces  were each organized under separate task forces.

Each  Multinational DivisionNorth, Southeast, and Southwest› within  Bosnia  is assigned a special operations command-and-control element (SOCCE) that controls the joint commission observer teams, which are  stationed  in  key  locations  to  serve  as  honest  brokers  in  maintaining communications  among  all factions and SFOR  commanders,  within each  division  sector.  Additionally,  the  SOF  supports  liaison  coordination elements,  which work for  the  multinativnal  battalions to  provide linguists and secure communications to the forward operating base and the CJSOTF. This SOF presence improved coordination and minimized misunderstanding. An average of ninety SOP soldiers were deployed to  Bosnia-Herzegovina throughout FY 1998.

To  help  implement  the  peace  agreement  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the Joint  Civil- Military  Operations  Task  Force  was  established  to  conduct civil- military operations in support of the commander, Stabilization Force (COMSFOR).  The  task  force  promotes  cooperation  with  the  civilian population, various agencies, and national governments; facilitates unified civilian effort in support of  the NATO peace plan for regional stabilization; and  prepares to  respond  to  humanitarian,  public  safety,  and public  health contingencies. An average of  about 129 civil affairs personnel were deployed in  Bosnia during FY 1998. These soldiers were integrated  into the SFOR from  the  headquarters  down  to  the  conventional  units  in  the  field.  The Joint  Psychological  Operations Task  Force  was  established to  support the COMSFOR by encouraging cooperation and noninterference with the peace implementation  process;  deterring  armed  resistance  to  SFOR  activities; reducing  accidental  injuries  and  death  from  unexploded  munitions;  and facilitating the  transition to  local  policing at the completion of the NATO mission. PSYOP forces provided direct support to SFOR maneuver units and higher levels to promote safety, security, and support for the SFOR mission. An average offifiy-five PSYOP soldiers were deployed in Bosnia during FY 1998.

SOF activities in  Kuwait  revolve around continuing a  permanent "tip of the spear" presence, enhancing command-and-control,  integrating joint forces, and coordinatingjoint and combined war plans as part  of  exercise IRIS GOLD. That exercise series involves the permanent presence of  one special forces  company,  which rotates every  120 days.  This  company  trains  with Kuwaiti armed forces units and conducts its own  internal training program. During FY 1998, IRIS GoLD  forces and the SOCCE-Kuwait supported U.S. Army  Forces, Central  Command,  in  exercise  INTRINSIC  ACTION.  They also

participated  in  training  with  close  air support  units  of Joint Task  Force› Southwest Asia as well  as forward-deployed U.S.  Navy SEAL and Special Boat Units.

ARSOF supported a variety of U.S.  operations in  Haiti with a military information  support  team  (PSYOP), ministerial advisory  teams  (CA), and  mission area analysis (special forces).  The focus  was  on assisting the Ministry of  Interior, the Ministry of  Justice, and the Ministry of  Contraband and  Customs.  ARSOF participated  in  exercise  FAIRWINDS  to  provide  CA support for humanitarian civic action construction projects.

ARSOF  also  functioned  as  the  primary  DOD  means  to  execute  the geographic  commanders  in  chief's humanitarian demining  operations.  In FY 1998 a total of385 ARSOF soldiers trained  1,206 host-nation demining personnel in  seventeen countries: Angola, Bosnia.  Cambodia, Chad,  Costa Rica,  Eritrea, Ethiopia,  Guatemala,  Honduras,  Jordan,  Laos,  Lebanon, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Rwanda, and Yemen. Special operations forces supported  the  geographic  commanders  in  chief's  humanitarian demining operations with a mix of  CA, PSYOP, and special forces soldiers. CA personnel helped host nations develop self-sustaining infrastructures to ensure that a national demining organization exists to oversee and sustain the program. The PSYOP trained and assisted host  nations in creating multimedia campaigns, which developed or increased mine awareness within the public. Special  forces  trained  host-nation militaries in mine clearance techniques, such as  locating,  mapping,  and  destroying  mines  in  place  (SOF  soldiers, however, never participate in actual mine-clearance activities).

ARSOF  played  a  key  role  in  the  U.S.  counternarcotics  program  in FY  1998,  assisting  host-nation efforts  by  providing assistance  in training, planning, and organizing counternarcotics programs and forces in the host nations.  ARSOF do  not deploy on actual counternarcotics operations with host-nation  forces.  The Army  provided  counternarcotics  assistance  to  the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,  Greece,  Guatemala,  Jamaica,  Malaysia,  Peru,  Thailand,  and Venezuela.

The Headquarters, Department of  the  Army (HQDA), Special Operations Division supported, monitored, and assisted a number of  other actions. In FY 1998, the SOCSOUTH relocated from Quarry Heights, Panama, to Roosevelt Roads,  Puerto  Rico,  in  compliance  with  the  1977  Panama  Canal Treaty that mandates the departure of all  U.S.  military forces from Panama by 31 December  1999.  Initial indications were that the SOCSOUTHincluding its organic Army units, Company C, 3d Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne), and D Company, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment› would be able to remain in Panama. However, when negotiations broke down with the government of Panama in July  1998, a new  location was required. The  SOCSOUTH,  with  direction  from  the  commanders  in  chief,  South,

developed  criteria  to  select a  new  location.  Candidate sites  included  Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Polk, Louisiana; Soto Cano, Honduras; and several sites in Florida and Puerto Rico.

The  civil  affairs  force  structure  changed  in  FY  1998  to  conform  to new operational  and  institutional  features.  In  accordance  with the  unified command  plan  change  that  transferred  responsibility  for  the  Caribbean from the Atlantic Command to the U.S. Southern Command, the 361 st Civil Affairs Brigade (the existing USAR civil atJairs brigade that supported the SOUTHCOM) became the 350th Civil Affairs Command. Creation of the fourth CA command standardizes CA command-and-control force structure throughout the U.S.  Army. CJ\ force  structure  thus  totals  four  civil  affairs commands and eight civil affairs brigades. The total of twenty-one general purpose battalions and three foreign internal defense/unconventional warfare battalions remained  the  same. Also during FY  1998,  the U.S.  Army  John F.  Kennedy Special  Warfare  Center and  School requested an exception  to policy for the establishment of a  PSYOP  regiment for affiliation  with  the psychological operations career management field  37 and Functional Area 39B. Before this, there was no regimental affiliation established for PSYOP soldiers.  On  15  July  1998,  the  HQDA  approved  the  establishment  of a PSYOP regiment.

In February 1997, the chief  of  staff, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), expressed concern to the deputy chief  of  staff  for operations and plans (DCSOPS) about Special Operations Command, Korea's, lack of  equipment authorizations and the resulting impact on readiness. The DCSOPS advised the chief of  staff, USFK, that no joint policy or  guidance existed for authorizing equipment for the theater special operations commands. On 15 January 1998, the director of  the Joint Staff  approved Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of  Staff  Instruction 4320.01, Equipment Authorizations .for Theater Special Operations Commands. This  document  not  only  provided  policy  and  guidance  for authorizing equipment for the theater special operations commands; it also assigned  executive  agent responsibility.  The Army  received  responsibility for theater special operations commands in Korea, Southern Command, and Europe.  In March  1998, Special Operations Command, Korea, became the first theater special operations command to receive warfighting equipment authorizations when  the director of  force programs approved its joint table of  allowances.

## Military Intelligence

In FY  1998,  an  "Intel  XXI"  study  team  developed  for  the  Army recommendations  that  dealt  with  doctrine,  training  and  education,  leader development, organizations,  materiel, and soldier systems. The study team recommended that the intelligence community initiate more than  160 tasks

between the end ofFY 1998 and the year 2010 in an effort to shape military intelligence  to meet  the  changing  needs  of the  Army.  The  initial  Intel XXI focus  was  on  the  twenty-first- century threat,  which  will  include  the conventional (or symmetric) threat posed by enemy armed forces as well as asymmetric threats outside the scope of  direct military action (for example, sabotage and terrorism). These threats may be synchronous (immediate) or asynchronous (taking effect well after their initiation, as in the case of  mine warfare). Equipped with a perspective on the threat, the study team designed ways to meet the information requirements specified by the Army's  principal futurist  agency,  the  Training  and  Doctrine  Center  (TRADOC).  The  team focused  on the  information  and  intelligence requirements  of Force  XXI, Strike Force, and the AAN.

A separate review of  foreign language management and resources within the Army  identified  the  lack of a  single  proponent  for  foreign  language issues.  Examination of the  applicable regulations  identified the Office  of the  Deputy  Chief of Staff fol' Intelligence  (ODCSINT)  as  the  pl'oponent for foreign languages  within  the  Army.  The  Army  Foreign  Language Proponency Office (AFLPO) was established within the ODCSINT on 23 March 1998 to serve as the proponent for all soldiers who require foreign language skills. Under the charter developed by the AFLPO and coordinated within the Army staff and the major commands, a process was developed to resolve  problems relating to provision and application of  foreign language skills. The process involves a series of meetings,  begi1ming with the Army Language Committee, progressing through a Foreign Language Council of Colonels, then to a Foreign Language General Officer Steering Committee. The charter specifies the organizations represented in these meetings.

In the field  of  Army counterintelligence, a  counterintelligence project under  the project manager for intelligence fusion in  FY 1998 mapped a future for tactical counterintelligence inside the  Army's  All-Source  Analysis System (ASAS). The ASAS serves as the Army's  premier battlefteld operating system for  military intelligence. In the tactical community, counterintelligence has provided useful intelligence to decision makers. New analysis systems, such as CHATS (the Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence  Automated Tool Set), the first version of  which was fielded late in FY 1998, have been one of the key contributors to this high  level of  success. At echelons above corps, Army counterintelligence has  been  revolutionizing business practices and establishing common DOD automation standards through the introduction of  the Defense Counterintelligence Information Systems.

In an effort to control the cost of personnel security investigations, the Quadreru1ial Defense Review recommended that DOD requesters be required to  pay  for  the  investigations  conducted. The DOD  Comptroller's Program Budget Decision  434 of November  1997  directed  that customer agencies pay for personnel security investigations conducted by the Defense Security

Service on  military  or civilian  members  of the  department. The  decision devolved funds from the Defense Security Service to the DOD components, including  the  Army,  to  offset  the  transfer  of responsibility.  The  Defense Security  Service  retained  responsibility and  funding  for  payment of those personnel  security  investigations  conducted  on  defense  contractors  under the National  Industrial  Security  Program.  As  FY 1998 closed,  discussions started  on  the  feasibility  of converting  the  remaining  Defense  Security Service functions to a fee-for-service program.

The  ODCSINT  assumed  responsibility  for  the  Army  Foreign  Liaison Officer (FLO) Program in  FY 1997. Since then, a program review  has  been underway with the goal of  bringing the training, certification, and employment of  FLOs into compliance with statutory and regulatory guidelines. The FLO Program's purpose is  to  protect  U.S.  technological  advantages,  identify  and designate key  technology programs and  processes the  United States wishes to obtain from  foreign  countries, position FLOs to improve the effectiveness of coalitions  between  the  United  States and  other  nations,  and  support the U.S.  National Security Strategy's goal of  engagement with emerging nations and enlargement of  existing alliances.  During the FLO Program Review, the emphasis has not been to change current policy but rather to implement a new process that would enforce existing policy and clarify required administrative procedures. An  agreement  between  the  ODCSINT  and  the  deputy  undersecretary of the Army for international affairs created an Army council of  colonels for international  disclosure  policy  on  29  April  1998.  The council's purpose  is to fmther the  common  interests of all participants  in  achieving  the Army's current and future international and intelligence objectives. Army Regulations 380-1 0, Technology  Transfer.  Disclosure  of  Information  and  Contacts  with Foreign Representatives (30 December 1994), and 34-1, International Militcuy Rationalization,  Standardization,  and Interoperability (15  February  1989), which govern foreign  disclosure,  foreign  liaison officers,  and  multinational force compatibility, serve as the council's primary reference documents. The mission of  the council is to assist the Army staff  and secretariat in executing a political and military strategy maximizing the benefits for the U.S. Army and allies, while preserving the security of  sensitive information and technology.

The  Intelligence  Community  Assignment  Program  continued  in  FY 1998,  providing  opportunities  for  developmental  rotations  throughout  the intelligence community for career civil servants in grades GS-13  and above. Beginning in  FY 2002, employees who aspire to senior executive positions in  the  intelligence  community  will  be  required  to  achieve  designation  as intelligence community officers. Additionally, policy was clarified, explicitly permitting  Civilian  Intelligence  Personnel  Management  System  (CIPMS) employees to participate in the Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP) but restricting CIPMS positions from being designated as DLAMP key positions.

## Nuclear,  Biological,  and Chemical Issues

The  Defense  Against  Weapons  of Mass  Destruction  Act  of  1996 mandated the enhancement  of  domestic preparedness and response capability  for  terrorist  attacks  involving  nuclear,  radiological,  biological, and chemical weapons, or other weapons of  mass destruction (WMD). The legislation funded improvements in the ability of  the federal, state, and local emergency agencies to prevent or, failing prevention, to respond to domestic terrorist incidents involving WMD. The DOD has the lead in developing the Emergency Response Assistance Program as  part of a  federal  interagency effort. The secretary of  defense has designated the secretary of  the Army as the executive agent for DOD program implementation. The Army director of military  support,  overseen  by  the  assistant  secretary  of the  Army  for installations,  logistics,  and environment, acts as  the staff action agent. The assistant secretary of  defense for special operations and low intensity conflict makes policy and administers funding for the DOD Domestic Preparedness Program. As a result of a 3 October 1997 Defense Review Board meeting, the deputy secretaty of defense asked the assistant secretaty of  defense for special operations and low intensity conflict, the assistant secretary of  defense for reserve affairs, and the assistant secretaty of the Army for installations, logistics, and environment to  provide an assessment for integrating the RC into ongoing WMD domestic preparedness programs funded by the Defense Against Weapons of  Mass Destruction Act.

On 3  November  1997,  the  deputy  secretary  of defense  directed  that the  undersecretary  of defense  for  personnel  and  readiness  (USD  [P&amp;R]) oversee the development of  a plan to integrate the RC into the planned DOD response to attacks using WMD. At the direction of  the USD (P&amp;R), a core group of expet1sa  "Tiger Team"was formed  to  complete the  plan.  In a  14  November  1997  memorandum, the undersecretary of defense placed the  undersecretary of the  Army  in  charge of the  plan's development.  The undersecretary  of the  Army  directed  the  Tiger Team  to  incorporate  the capabilities of  the RC into the plan. The  Tiger  Team focused on the provision of appropriate,  substantive,  and  integrated  DOD  support  to  government authorities responding to a WMD attack as the basis for the plan. The team reviewed existing programs, applied scenario-driven analysis, and sought the opinions of other experts  in  the emergency preparedness  field.  The Tiger Team used  the existing  Interagency  Strategic  Plan  and  Federal Response Plan and recognized existing statutory restrictions and  training limitations in  producing its analysis. The resulting DOD plan for "Integrating National Guard  and  Reserve  Component  Support  for  Response  to  Attacks  Using Weapons of  Mass Destruction" was published on 6 January 1998. The plan set  forth  an  evolutionary  process  to  fill  gaps  in  existing  capabilities  for responding  to  WMD attacks,  incorporating the  capabilities  of RC  forces,

such as chemical and medical units. Although disaster relief is primarily a state mission, given the nature of  a WMD attack, the plan recognized that the DOD could anticipate requests for  federal  assets much earlier than  during more typical disasters.

Assessing  the  DOD's capabilities,  the Tiger Team concluded  that  the department was  insufficiently prepared to perform tasks  that other federal agencies  might  be  likely  to  request.  In  addition,  the  civilian  emergency response  community  lacked  the  ability  to  assess  the  nature  and  scope  of WMD attacks. The team determined that it was necessary to create Military Support Detachments  (Rapid  Assessment  and  Initial  Detection  [RAID]) to  provide a  DOD capability  to  respond  to domestic WMD attacks. RAID teams  would  assist  with  identifying chemical,  biological,  and  radiological agents  and  mitigating  hazards  in  affected  areas,  and  then  would  identify the areas requiring evacuation as opposed to areas where it would  be safer for the affected  population  to  remain  in  place.  In  addition  to  establishing RAID detachments, the plan called for equipping the chemical companies and platoons in the RC with state-of-the-art civilian and military equipment. These  organizations would then train in civilian hazardous material procedures in addition to their military missions of nuclear, chemical, and biological reconnaissance and patient decontamination. The  Tiger  Team plan also called for an analysis of  the preparedness of  the medical community as a whole to deal with a WMD incident, with the intent of  enabling the RC to help resolve unmet needs  for medical treatment and  support.  In  addition, the plan recommended developing distance-learning programs for military response  elements,  as  well  as  for  local  first  responders,  and  conducting interagency exercises to test response capabilities and  develop better response mechanisms. The Tiger Team also suggested changes in policies and laws to better facilitate  the  RC  response.  These  included a  review  and  update  of various DOD directives concerning continuity of  operation, military support to civil authorities, and protection of  key assets.

On  17  March  1998,  the  secretary  of defense  announced  the  WMD Consequence  Management  Program  and  directed  the  establishment  of the  Consequence  Management Program  Integration  Office  (COMPIO)  in the Army  Directorate of Military Support. The COMPIO was tasked with evaluating the current capabilities of  the DOD's WMD-response elements. The  office  was  also  made  responsible  for  coordinating  the  development of  doctrine  and  training  for  response  to  WMD  attacks.  In  addition,  the COMPIO was to  supervise the coordinated development of exercises with local, state, and  federal response elements. Although functioning within the Army staff, the COMPIO is a DOD office, staffed with both Army and Air Force personnel, designed to enhance the capabilities of  first responders and to identify,  train, and equip functionally focused military response elements ranging in size from  five  to sixty people. The mission of  these elements is to

support local, state, and federal responses to WMD attacks. These response elements could be employed in  federal status as part of  a  federal  response task force.  Governors could also employ National Guard elements as part of a state response.

## The Army in Space

Army space support teams provide rapid-response multispectral imagery  (space  imagery  involving  and  integrating  mtlltiple  bands  of the electromagnetic  spectrum), weather  information,  mission  planning rehearsals, and  commercial satellite communications  in support of deployed  military forces. These teams deployed thirteen times in FY  1998 to support training and  operational  missions  of unified  commands,  providing  greater  global positioning  accuracy,  satellite  weather  data,  and  space-based  intelligence analysis.

The Army has recently begun conducting operations to improve its use of  space. AAN Space Game One, held in June 1997 at the Space and Missile Defense  Command's (SMDC's) Advanced  Research Center  in Huntsville, Alabama, focused on moves the United States could make in space before the outbreak of  hostilities. The key finding  from Space Game One was that deterrence  from  space,  by  itself,  was  insufficient  without  other  actions, including diplomacy and economic sanctions. After the first game, the Army saw the need to get a more detailed picture of how its forces would employ space-based  resources  to  fight  in  the  future.  The  SMDC  co-hosted AAN Space Game Two with the National Reconnaissance Office and the TRADOC in Colorado Springs, Colorado, from 28 January to 5 February  1998. In the game, the Army studied the effects of projected space-based capabilities in 2021  in a major regional contingency. Building on the experience of  Space Game One,  Space  Game Two  looked  at  how  space  operations  would  fit into  a cohesive theater campaign that established "mission assurance,"  the ability to maintain an expected level of force capabilities, including space› based  services.  Specifically,  the  game  examined  how  space  warfighting concepts  and  technologies  could  be  synchronized  with  theater  campaign plans,  identified  the  operational  and  organizational  issues  in  integrating space support into a warfighting commander-in-chief's  staff, and determined the  constraints  on  space-based  capabilities  that  adversely  affect  theater operations. Looking forward to the environment of 2021, Space Game Two also considered the policies that would ensure effective space operations and examined the  impact on warfare of the  proliferation of commercial space activities.  The  game also  explored  a U.S.  space order of battle  to  address multiple possibilities in 2021 and continued to identify the asymmetric threats that the United States  should expect from a major competitor. Preliminary observations drawn  from  the game suggested  that the Army  had acquired

a  better  understanding of the  timelines  for  terrestrial  and  space  activities and  how to synchronize them.  Game results also  indicated  that  the Army has achieved a beUcr understanding of the role of  space support in military operations,  particularly  the  relationship  of military  and  commercial  space activities,  and  that the Army  has  learned how space systems and nonspace systems, such as satellites and unmanned air vehicles, can complement each other.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

The  active  Army  provides  the  bulk  of Army  forces  at  the  outset  of contingencies,  but  completion  of  any  substantial mission requires  the additional forces of  the reserve component (RC):  the Army National Guard (ARNG), which included more than half of the Army's total force structure, and the  U.S.  Army Reserve (USAR).  In FY 1998, the ARNG  made up 34 percent of  the Army's total force structure and served as a strategic reserve. The Guard provided 55 percent of the Army's combat units with its eight divisions,  fifteen  enhanced separate  brigades  (eSBs),  three  other separate brigades, and two special forces groups. The ARNG supplied 46 percent of  the Army's  combat support, 25 percent of  its combat service support, 63  percent of its field artillery, and 46 percent of the service's air defense artillery. The nearly twenty-four hundred units of  the USAR represented 20 percent of  the Army force structure. Army Reserve units provided 20 percent of  the Army's combat support, 47  percent of the service's combat service support, and 98 percent of  its civil affairs and psychological operations force.

In FY 1998, the RC faced a major challenge in managing its resources to  fulfill  Army  force  structure  requirements.  The  ARNG  developed  the state objective  force  structure-redesign process  to  manage  force  structure requirements and changes across the fifty states, plus the  District  of  Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Using this process in conjunction with Total Army Analysis,  all  National  Guards  would  be programmed  to their  optimal  end  strengths  while  they  maintained  the  structure  required to support the National Military Strategy and domestic requirements. The USAR's main concern was its inability to meet force structure requirements with  limited  end  strength.  In  FY  1998,  the  Army  Reserve  achieved  its Selected Reserve end-strength target. This achievement required extensive coordination between the Army Reserve and the Army's personnel-related commands.

In  keeping  with  the  total  force  concept,  the  trend  toward  increasing integration of  the active (AC) and reserve components continued in FY 1998. The teaming concept partners AC divisions with  ARNG divisions. The initial test of  this concept involves two teams: the I st Cavalry Division, stationed at

Fort llood, Texas, teamed with the 49th Armored Division, Texas ARNG; the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized), also stationed at Fort Hood, teamed with the 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized), CaliforniaARNG. The partnership of the teamed divisions would  be based on training and support, with each division relying on its partner to assist in common missions.  In addition to the teamed divisions,  the Army plans to  form  integrated AC- RC divisions, scheduled  for  activation  in  the  first  quarter  of FY  2000.  An  AC-ARNG integrated division  would  consist of three eSDs under an AC headquarters overseeing  the  brigades' training  and  readiness.  The  integrated  division program encompasses the  activation  of one  heavy and  one  light division (numerical designations to be determined). The 30th, 48th, and 218th eSBs, all  mechanized infantry brigades, are scheduled to become part of a  heavy division headquartered at Fort Riley, Kansas, with a forward headquarters at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The 39th, 41st, and 45th eSBs would make up a  light division with headquarters at Fort Carson, Colorado. More generally, for the first time the Division XXI redesign specified organic RC positions in  active  heavy  divisions.  Reorganization  was  under way  in  the  Program Objective Memorandum for FYs  1998-2003. The Army programmed $743 million for realignment and reorganization, with $83  million  for the active component, $468 million for the ARNG, $I 92 million for the USAR, and an extra $200 million in  FY 1998 for division redesign.

## Funding

Of the total Army funding in FY 1998, the ARNG accounted for about 9  percent and  the USAR accounted for 5 percent. The reserve component experienced some funding shortfalls for operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), construction,  depot  maintenance,  and  major equipment  in  FY  1998.  The ARNG  could  not  fund  O&amp;M  requirements  totaling  $455  million  in  FY 1998  and estimated  the  O&amp;M  funding  shortfall  for  FY  I  999  to  be  $450 million.  Shortages existed for schools and special training, clothing, depot maintenance, readiness accounts, environmental requirements, information management,  and  training  suppot1.  Many  ARNG  units,  including  those designated  for  early  deployment,  diet  not  have  the  necessary resources  to maintain  readiness  levels.  Two-thirds  of the  ARNG  force  structure  was designated  as a  strategic reserve and  was  allotted  resources at levels  that permitted only individual or squad-level proficiency training. Some ARNG officials  felt that the  mobilization  period  might not allow adequate time to achieve unit  proficiency. Given the uncertain amount of  time a later-deploying unit would have to increase its readiness during the mobili:.cation period, the Army leadership decided that additional resources should  be made available to train to platoon-level or higher tasks. The lowest-priority group of units, Force Package 4, was allotted only 13 percent of  the funds needed to achieve

unit-level readiness. Reduced funding curtailed tank gunnery and maneuver training. The readiness of  seven of  the eightARNG divisions declined during FY 1998 because of  significant funding shortfalls for readiness training.

In FY 1998, USAR  operation  and maintenance  programs were underfunded by more than $509 million.  Shortages existed in civilian pay, real prope1ty maintenance, information management, base communications, operational  tempo,  and  depot  maintenance.  Whereas  Tier  1  units  were funded  at  100  percent, Tier  2  units  were  funded  at  only  50  percent,  and Tiers 3 to 5 were  unfunded.  In the personnel account, schools and special training were underfunded. Because of  the shortage of  school training funds in the USAR accounts, annual training funds were spent to send individual soldiers to school rather than to provide unit annual training. Although this schooling enhanced  individual  professional development,  it did  so  to  the detriment of  unit collective training. O&amp;M funds for the USAR in FY 1998 were  insufficient  to  support adequately  the  National  Military  Strategy  of conducting two nearly simultaneous major theater wars. A shortfall existed for some  later-deploying  and  support  units.  The  Army  recognized  this shortfall in the planning, programming, and budgeting system process and applied a funding strategy that provides resources on a "first-to-fight" basis. As  a  result,  the USAR has  increased its training,  readiness,  and  ability to meet its critical wartime requirements.

## Strength and Personnel Management

Authorized  end  strength  for  the  reserve  component  in  FY  1998  was 570,000. The ARNG sought to achieve an FY98 end-strength objective with a  Selected Reserve strength of 362,000, comprising 40,291  commissioned and warrant officers and 321,709 enlisted personnel. To attain this goal, the ARNG programmed its enlisted gains at 56,638, officer gains at 3,682, and enlisted extensions at 45,318;  enlisted  losses  were  not  to  exceed  64,219. The fiscal year ended with ARNG strength at 362,459 (100.1  percent of its end-strength objective). Total strength included 39,307 officers and 323,152 enlisted  personnel.  The  USAR  sought  an  end  strength  for  FY  1998  of 208,000 and achieved an end strength of204,968 (a fill rate of98.5 percent). Although the USAR came close to meeting its end-strength objective, it fell shott of  its accession goals.

Women continued to play an important role in the  reserve component in  FY  1998.  In the ARNG, women  make up almost one tenth of the force. Significantly,  women are serving in  higher-ranking positions; for example, the ARNG recently gained its first female major general. In August 1998, the Army National Guard Women's Advisory Committee was formed  to serve as an  ARNG  voice  for  the Defense  Department Advisory  Committee  on Women in the Services and to address issues affecting women. In FY 1998,

the reserve component took additional steps to reduce the number of  sexual harassment incidents. The ARNG introduced the Army's Consideration of Others Program, which promotes professional behavior, whether on- or off› duty, by focusing on the Army's core values. The USAR Selected Reserve force was 20.8 percent female.  For the past four years, 98  percent of the career flelds in the Army Reserve have been open to women. The recruiting rate  for  non- prior-service  females in the  USAR  was 36.0 percent in FY 1998, down slightly from 37.9 percent in FY 1997.

TheARNG completed its transition to a new promotion system using the Select-Train-Promote methodology. This system set statewide promotion standards, with one board per grade per year.  It enabled soldiers to  enroll in Noncommissioned Officer Education System courses immediately upon selection and provided  soldiers  ranked as  best qualified  in their military occupational specialties (MOSs) for assignment to higher-graded positions as  they  became  available.  Soldiers  were  responsible  for  reviewing  their administrative  qualifications  to  ensure  the  currency  of their  personnel records and for electing or declining consideration for promotion. Those who elected consideration  also  were  required  to  choose from  a  range of options  concerning where  they  would  accept assignment and promotion within the state.

The U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Center in  St. Louis, Missouri, became the U.S. Army Reserve Perso1mel Command (  AR-PERSCOM) (Provisional) on  16  October  1997.  On  1 October 1998,  the AR-PERSCOM ceased to be a provisional  command,  attaining permanent status. The formation of the AR-PERSCOM resulted from a study by an Army Reserve Council of Colonels. This group, convened  in  1994 to  assess how  the f1mctions  and structure of  the Army Reserve fit into the Army Force XXI modernization plan, determined that Army Reserve policy functions, personnel management, and service could be streamlined. The group recommended consolidation of  these functions into one command, the new Army Reserve Personnel  Command. The AR-PERSCOM  provided a  single focal point for  supporting Army  Reserve personnel  management  in both peacetime and mobilization environments.  It also  improved the  interoperability for mobilization  support  between  the Total  Army  Personnel  Command  and the  Army  Reserve.  The  AR-PERSCOM  implemented  business  process initiatives  to  enhance  personnel  readiness  for  USAR  soldiers.  These initiatives  included  accelerated  automation  standardization,  realig1m1ent of organizational  responsibility  (especially  for  career  management  and personnel actions), and adoption of  a personnel management organization more  consistent  with  the  active  component's Department  of the  Army PERSCOM.

The Individual  Ready Reserve Activation Authority (IRRAA), based on lessons learned from the Gulf  War, is designed to help ensure the timely

availability  of certain  trained  and  qualified  members  of the  Individual Ready Reserve to fill  selected shortfalls in early-mobilizing or -deploying AC and RC units. During Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, later-deploying  units  were activated  to  provide  personnel  to  fill  earlier› deploying units. This procedure, however, compromised the cohesion and readiness  of those  later-deploying units.  To  prevent this  development in future mobilizations, the Army proposed what became Section 511  of  the FY98 National Defense Authorization Act, which established the IRRAA. Section  51 I  amended  Section  10144  of  Title  10,  U.S.  Code,  to  create a new category oflndividual Ready Reserve members subject to involuntary call to active duty under a Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up (PSRC). Additionally, Section 511  amended Section 12304 of  Title 10 to authorize the  president  to  call  as  many  as  thirty  thousand  members  of this  new Individual  Ready  Reserve  category  from  all  services,  with  no  set  limit to  the  number  of qualified  individuals  who  could  volunteer.  Reservists subject to  the  IRRAA are volunteers from all  services  who agree  to  be involuntarily called up during a PSRC. Candidates for IRRAA status must have a remaining service obligation, must be within twenty-four months of honorable separation from their last active or reserve service, must have trained within the last twenty-four months, and must be physically fit and MOS-qualificd. IRRAA members are not required to attend drills or annual training, but they have priority for available refresher training and training opportunities with units that need their skills.

The Army Reserve prepared for the implementation of  the Army's  new officer evaluation reporting system, which was scheduled to take effect on 1 October 1998. This preparation included policy revisions, chain teaching, and hardware and software upgrades to ensure a smooth transition to the new system. The USAR also completed phase I of  the transition to Officer Personnel Management System XXI, including extensive impact studies, personnel  analyses,  career  model  development,  briefings,  and  continual coordination with the active Army.

## Training

In August 1998, the Army National Guard conducted the second battle› focused training exercise at the ARNG Training and Training Technology Battle  Lab  at  Fort  Dix,  New  Jersey.  The  Fort  Dix  facility  employed available resources to  train  lower-priority  units  by  providing a  stressful, realistic  experience  using  live,  virtual,  and  constructive  (that  is,  having iconic or symbolic  representations  in  place of actual  forces,  as in table› top  games)  training  environments  with  aggressive  opposing  forces  and observer controllers. The first two exercises trained mechanized maneuver battalions in a scenario-based operation with maximum attention to multi-

echelon and individualized training. Intensive planning began for the FY99 exercise, which was expected to  focus on an artillery battalion as part of  a division staff  exercise.

Continued  development  and  fielding  of simulators  has  led  to  the expanded  usc of this  technology  throughout the ARNG.  By the  close  of FY 1998, the 1\.RNG  had  fielded  more than  60 twelve-lane and 75  four› lane  Engagement  Skill  Trainers  with  enhanced  crew-served  simulation weapons  mix; 140  Armor  Full-Crew  Interactive  Simulation  Trainers; 40  Janus  staff/maneuver  trainers;  and  150  Guard  Unit  Armory  Device Full-Crew  Interactive  Simulation  Trainer-lis  (GUARDFIST-IIs)  forward observer one-to-one trainers. Other simulators fielded in FY 1998 included seven  GUARDFIST-IIA  forward  observer one-to-thirty  trainers;  and  265 Digital Systems Test and Training Simulators for field artillery units. This fie lding  more  than  doubled  the  FY97  fielding  of these critical  devices, thereby  significantly  enhancing 1\.RNG  training  capabilities.  The  Guard also continued to  increase the  use of its  first  two sets of  the mobile close combat tactical trainer (one each  for Abrams  tanks  and  Bradley  fighting vehicles) by units throughout the southeastern United States.

STEP, the SIMITAR (Simulation in Training for Advanced Readiness) Training Exportable Program, is derived from SIMITAR, a five-year joint experimental program of the ARNG and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  intended  to  change  the  way  ARNG  maneuver brigades train tluough  the development of  advanced simulation techniques.  Under SIMITAR, technologies such as interactive simulations have been combined with new training strategies to  train Guard members in more skills within a  fixed  amount  of time.  The  program  was  designed  to  meet  observed deficiencies in battle syncruonization, collective training, combat service support  integration,  and  individual  skill attainment.  Applied  through STEP,  SIMITAR is  intended  to  increase  Army  National  Guard  training readiness  two  or  three  times,  compared  with  that  in  the  1991 DESERT SIIIELD  mobilization.  The  program  also  has  the  goal  of developing and integrating affordable technologieswhere possible, existing commercial ones-that would enable ARNG units and soldiers to conduct realistic and sophisticated training in  their local communities. During FY 1998, ARNG heavy  brigades  used  STEP  to  enhance  training  at  the  National Training Center.

In FY  1998, the ARNG began developing an Aviation Reconfigurable Manned  Simulator  (ARMS)  as  a  cost-effective  way  to  enhance  flying safety and  readiness. The ARMS is a cooperative effort of the U.S. Army Aviation Center and the Army's Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command.  The  device  provides  a  360-degrcc  virtual  environment  by means  of a  helmet-mounted  display  system,  cockpit  housing,  realistic controls, and  interactive cockpit  panels. Each simulator provides training

in individual and crew tasks;  focuses  on collective,  combined-arms,  and joint-service operations;  and  can  be  quickly  reconfigured  to  each of the helicopters flown  in the ARNG.

The ARNG  fiberoptic communications architecture linked 639 classrooms in the Guard program, with the goal of providing a distance› learning  classroom  within  sixty  minutes' travel  time  of every  soldier. The Army Distance Learning Program incorporated  132 ARNG-installed classrooms to support the Army school system's training of  guardsmen. In the Army Reserve the goal was to provide distance-learning capability at every Army Reserve Center or training location. In April1998, the ARNG Distributed Training Technology Plan was presented the Computerworldl Smithsonian  award  as  a  program  whose  visionary  use  of information technology produced positive social, economic, and educational change. In conjunction with Fort Knox, the ARNG successfully piloted a Web-based offering of  portions of  the advanced armor officers' course in FY 1998.

The USAR  also continued to develop, integrate, and improve automation systems for training in FY  1998. The Battle-Focused Training Management  System  was  fielded to facilitate training management at  company,  battalion,  and  brigade  levels.  The  application  assisted  in developing the unit mission statement and the mission essential task list. The system was also upgraded to work with the Center Level Application System to collect and transmit the training assessment model through the chain of  command. These actions were interim steps leading to the Reserve Level Automation System (RLAS), which represented the USAR's  business applications for the Reserve Component Automation System. The RLAS was  intended to  use the power of local- and wide-area networks to bring current information to decision makers; a beta version was being tested at the end ofFY 1998.

Army  reservists  honed  their  combat  support  and  combat  service support skills in more than thirty major exercises during FY 1998. Exercise RIO BRAVO, which involved USAR chemical unit support to a variety of headquarters  and  maneuver units,  was  particularly  noteworthy  in  that it was the largest chemical training exercise since World War II. Designed to evaluate the ability ofUSAR installations to accomplish their mobilization missions during a simulated mobilization surge, Exercise CALL  FORWARD was  conducted  at  four  installations:  Fort  Bragg,  California;  Fort  Polk, Louisiana; Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico. Thirteen USAR units, with 848  soldiers,  participated in CALL  FORWARD.  Exercise POSITIVE  FoRCG  was  a  Joint Chiefs  of Staff (JCS)-sponsored  worldwide command post exercise designed to assess national capabilities to conduct mobilization  and  deployment  operations  in support  of two  regional contingencies.  POSITIVE  FoRCE  used  the  PSRC  and  partial  mobilization decision process, with eighty-seven Army Reserve units participating.

## Readiness

The 1995 Base Realignment  and Closure (BRAC)  Commission recommended  relinquishing  four  major  active-Army  installations  to  the ARNG.  In FY  1998,  minimum essential  training  facilities  at  Fort Pickett (Virginia), Fort Chaffee (Arkansas), and Fort Indiantown Gap (Pennsylvania) were transferred to their respective state National Guards. These installations operate as ARNG training centers, each capable of  supporting brigade-level operations, including most necessary maneuver areas and live-fire ranges. At the end ofFY 1998, final planning and coordination was in process to transfer the minimum essential training facilities of  Fort McClellan, Alabama, to the Alabama ARNG in FY 1999.

The BRAC process has  had  limited direct impact on USAR readiness. To  date,  its  major  impact  has  been  on  long-range  planning  for  major construction. Many Army Reserve facilities  are more than thirty  years old and thus are approaching the point where they would be cheaper to replace than maintain. The goal of the USAR has  been to obtain, through BRAC, sufficient  newer  buildings  to  replace  old  or  leased  ones,  but  the  BRAC process has not provided good-quality buildings so far.

The Army National Guard manages overall readiness by giving priority for resources to units that  are designated "first  to deploy." This method ensures that  high-priority  units  receive  necessary  resources  to  meet  operational readiness  requirements.  Critical units,  such as  those  in  the  Force Support Packages (FSPs) and the eSBs, have benefited significantly from this tiered allocation of  resources, whereas lowet-priority units, such as the eightARNG divisions,  have  struggled  to  maintain  acceptable  readiness  levels  under existing  fiscal  constraints.  During  FY  1998,  unit  status  reports  indicated that overall unit readiness levels declined  by 5 percent. Contributors to this decline  included  decreased  training  levels  and  equipment  serviceability, as  well  as  more personnel not qualified in their duty MOSs. However, this same period witnessed a slight increase in senior-grade personnel with duty MOS-qualified status and in equipment-on-hand levels. Also, the number of soldiers not deployable because of  a lack of  duty qualification has decreased by  approximately two thousand since FY  1997, primarily because soldiers have received appropriate MOS training.

The 218 ARNG units designated in the FSPs were the highest-priority units  for  the  Army  National  Guard.  Combat support and  combat  service support units  make up the  vast majority of the  Guard's FSP roster.  These units  were  doctrinally  aligned  to  support  two  nearly  simultaneous  major theater wars. They featured one full and one partial corps headquarters, one theater slice of higher echelon units sufficient to  support a corps, and  the support elements necessary to open one theater. There were two FSPs: FSP 1 supported four and one-third divisions, one full corps headquarters, and one

theater slice;  FSP 2 supported the remaining crisis response forces.  During FY  1998, unit status reports indicated a 4  percent increase in overall  FSP readiness.

The fifteen ARNG enhanced separate brigades are the Army's principal reserve  ground  combat  maneuver  forces  and  are  fully  integrated  into the  scenario  of two  major  theater  wars.  The  eSBs  are  expected  to  meet established ARNG readiness goals by the end of FY 1999. Additionally, all of  the eSBs have achieved the Army Mobilization and Operations Planning and Execution System deployment standards. Funding was a major concern for the eight ARNG divisions. During FY 1998, training readiness within the ARNG divisions declined because of insufficient operating tempo (funded annual vehicle mileage or flight hours) and execution funding. As a result, premobilization  training  levels  and  the  overall  readiness  of these  units dramatically decreased.  FY98 data indicated that overall unit resources and training levels in the divisions  declined  15 percent as a  result of  decreases in duty MOS-qualified status, equipment  serviceability, and training readiness.

The use of  ARNG units in support of  Operations JOI NT GUARD and JOINT FORGE  had  a  positive effect on  both unit readiness  and  soldier  retention. Negative  effects on  employers  and families appeared to be limited.  TheARNG has lessened the call-up impact by establishing the Employer Support of  the Guard and Reserve Program. Under this program, the Guard has established policies  for  rotating  mobilized  units  from  one  contingency  operation  to the next and for  using volunteers first in mobilizing for contingencies. The ARNG has also  worked  to coordinate call-ups to  allow as much advance time as possible to lessen personnel turbulence for employers.

A  USAR  survey  of  soldiers  returning  from  Bosnia  indicated  that approximately  52  percent  would  volunteer  for  future  mobilizations;  35 percent said  they  were  unlikely  or very unlikely  to  volunteer.  Almost 70 percent stated that they would not complain if  called for future mobilizations. More than 66 percent of those surveyed stated that the maximum period of activation should not exceed 180 days. However, of  physicians mobilized for Bosnia-related operations, 34  percent have since left the Selected Reserve. Other mobilized physicians have indicated they now remain in the Selected Reserve only because time remains on their service contracts.

## Mobilization

Army  National  Guard  and  Army  Reserve  soldiers  participated  in  a number of contingency operations during FY  1998. The ARNG mobilized 2,227 soldiers from  ninety-six units and forty states under PSRC authority in  support of Operations JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  JOINT  GUARD,  and  JOINT FORGI1 in Europe as well  as Operation SOUTHERN  W  ATCII  in Kuwait. The types of

units  (and  the number of soldiers  mobilized)  were the  following:  5  adjutant general detachments (262),  17 aviation command-and-control elements (528), 4  combat support and logistics units (62), 4  engineer elements (88),  6  field artillery fire support elements (124), 8 finance detachments (136),  1 infantry company (129),  2  medical  units  (70),  1 military  history  detachment (3),  l military police company (125), 1 movement control detachment (8),  16 public affairs detachments (133), 2 signal elements (44), 2 special forces command› and-control elements (14), 6 target acquisition batteries (247), 1 transportation company  (153),  as  well  as  20  other Table  of Distribution  and  Allowances support elements (  1  01 ).

In Operations JOINT ENDEAVOR and JOINT GUARD, the RC was required to bring the readiness of  deploying units to specific  levels. Inactive duty training and annual training funds already programmed for those units were used, but additional resources were needed because additional expenses were incurred as equipment was redistributed  among Guard units and  states. Additional personnel were also needed to help mobilize the units. To accomplish the mobilization, lower-priority units gave up resources, with an undetermined impact on those units.  The  USAR  paid soldiers  mobilized  for  contingency  operations  from the  military personnel appropriation. The USAR has traditionally  supported contingency operations  using PSRC  procedures instead of volunteerism and temporary tours of  active  duty. Like other  portions of  the  Depattment  of  Defense (DOD) reserve component, the USAR does not plan or budget for contingency operations  but relies on Congress to  provide funds. Contingency opeiations that are not fully funded create requirements that end up being funded  out of the operation and maintenance accounts.

In  addition  to  deployments  under  PSRC  authority,  ARNG  soldiers  on temporaty tours of  active duty supported peacekeeping operations in  Eastern Europe (Operations JorNT ENDEAVOR,  JOINT GUARD, and JOINT FORGE),  in the Middle East (Operation SouTilERN  WATCH),  and in Macedonia  (Task Force ABLE SENTRY). A total of2,292 ARNG personnel deployed in support of  those missions during FY 1998. Evety ARNG division provided units to Operation JOINT GUARD.  Many provided critical skills, notably infantry, as well as target acquisition, forward observation, and weather services for field artillety units. In addition to these European deployments, nineteen hundred Army National Guard soldiers deployed throughout the Pacific region in FY 1998 to relieve shortages that had led  to  excessive  personnel  tempo and operating tempo  in a  variety of  AC  combat,  combat supp01t,  and combat service support units. The ARNG soldiers included military intelligence and engineer specialists and those with expertise in maintenance of  the war equipment stocks positioned in Korea and  Japan. Since the beginning of Operation JOINT  FORGE on 20 June 1998, almost twelve thousand USAR soldiers have been mobilized under the PSRC.  Some 286 Army reservists were mobilized  for Southwest Asia.  One hundred  ninety-two  soldiers  mobilized  from  the  310th Chemical  Company

(Biological  Integrated Detection System) and the rest from  two detachments of the 321 st Material  Management Center for the  initial efforts of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in March 1998.

During  FY  1998,  the Army National Guard provided approximately six million workdays to support theAC. Approximately ninety-four hundredARNG soldiers deployed to Europe for training and operational  mission support. V Corps depends on RC units to participate as key players in most of  its exercises. Guard units  participated  in  the V  Corps  warfighter command post exercises and Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC) rotations. For Seventh Army Training Command, which operated the CMTC at Hohenfels, Germany, ARNG units deployed for opposing-force, maintenance, battle staff training, military police, and engineer missions at the CMTC and at Grafenwoelu-, Germany, site of  an administration and logistics support base. In the Southern European  Task Force, the U.S. Army component of  the Allied Forces Southern Region, located in Vicenza,  Italy,  Army  Guard units  participated  in JCS-directed  exercises, and petformed maintenance, military police, communications, and engineer missions.

The Army Reserve contributed  more than 2.2  million workdays  to AC missions dm·ing FY 1998. Approximately 48 percent of  annual training and 34 percent  of  active  duty for training were dedicated to support  of  the  AC. This total included  245,000  workdays  oflntelligence  Contributory  Support  to commanders in chief, combat support agencies, and Army Service Component Commands worldwide. Support included signal intelligence, human intelligence, imagery intelligence, all-source intelligence, and counterintelligence. All missions were conducted under inactive duty training, annual training, and active duty training status. Under the PSRC that began in December 1995 and continued through FY 1998, the Army Reserve provided units and individual augmentees to the U.S. efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary and to the backfill of  units in Europe. The USAR has provided more than eleven thousand soldiers in  some 437 units to support Operations JOINT  ENDEAVOR,  JOINT  GUARD,  and JOINT FORGE. The Army Reserve also participated in the overseas deployment training programs, counterdrug operations at home and  abroad,  engineering and  maintenance missions in Southwest Asia, and medical and  engineering assistance in South America. Almost four thousand Army reservists provided deployment and redeployment support for two AC rotations  to the National Training Center. More than five thousand Army reservists from more than fifty units provided combat support and combat service supp01t to m1its at the Joint Readiness Training Center.

## Reserve Component Support to Civil Authorities

Military support to civil authorities has been the Army N  a  tiona! Guard's most common peacetime function. As local, state, and federal budgets for

specialized  disaster  response  decreased,  the  Guard  was  more  necessary than ever in responding  to  natural disasters, civil  disturbances, and other emergencies. Most important, the ARNG was ready and available in case of  emergency, saving the expense and manpower required for a comparable full-time force. In  FY 1998, the Guard conducted 308 emergency response missions in forty-nine states and territories. Of  these call-ups,  172 were in response to natural disasters, 23  were in response to civil emergencies, 3 l were in support of law enforcement agencies, and 82 were for other types of  missions. The ARNG used 374,1 15 man-days in these domestic support missions,  primarily  in  state  active-duty  status.  Although  the  number of missions  remained  constant,  they  made greater  demands:  In  FY  1998, there was an increase of 93,561  man-days over those of  the previous fiscal year.  The  most significant  domestic support operations  were in response to  Hurricanes  Bonnie  (North  Carolina)  and  Georges  (Florida,  Georgia, Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Puerto  Rico,  and  Virgin  Islands).  Floods,  winter storms, and wildfires also consumed a large number of  man-days.

In  addition,  more  than  ninety-five  hundred  Army  National  Guard so.ldiers  from  thirty  states  completed  164  medical,  engineer,  and  other support projects  under the  Innovative Readiness Training  (IRT) Program in  FY  1998.  Eight  hundred  ARNG  engineers  assisted  the  West Virginia Airport Authority by improving the Benedum Airport infrastructure, mainly through road construction and excavation. The Guard provided an exercise headquarters and engineer assets, Task Force GRIZZLY  ROAD  BUILDER,  to construct barriers  and  access  roads  to  interdict  the  flow  of illegal  drugs into  the United  States. Fifteen engineer battalions  built  roads and  fences along the California- Mexico border, between the Otay Mountains and the Pacific  Coast.  Exercise  REEFEX  used  decommissioned  army  vehicles  to create artificial reefs in the Atlantic Ocean. New Jersey and South Carolina ARNG members received the equipment, stripped the components, removed fuels  and lubricants to  meet Environmental Protection Agency standards, and helped position the equipment correctly. In Operation ALASKA  ROAD, Army National  Guard and  Marine Reserve  Forces  built about half of a fourteen-mile road within the Metlakatla Indian Communily, near Annette Is land, Alaska. The guardsmen and marines were ferried to the work site on USAR watercraft.  When the road is completed, the citizens of Metlakatla will  have  access  to  a  proposed  ferry  terminal  site and  improved  access to  the city of Ketchikan. For FY  1999,  at  least twenty-three states  have submitted ninety-three IRT project proposals (for a total  proposed budget amount of $8.5 million).

During  FY  1998 Army  Reserve  forces  also  assisted  civil  authorities responding to disasters. Notable examples included responses after  Typhoon Paka  on  Guam;  ice  storms  in  the  northeastern  United  States;  a  major snowstorm in  Marion, Virginia,  in  early  1998; a  tornado  in Washington,

Iowa, in May; droughts in Texas; severe storms in Fort Scott, Kansas; and floods  and wildfires across  the  southern  United  States  in  the summer of 1998.  In the aftermath of Hurricanes Bonnie, Danielle, and Georges, the USAR quickly responded with forklifts and operators, as well as with M915 tractors with trailers and drivers.  Army Reserve emergency preparedness liaison officers  served  in  three Federal Emergency Management Agency regions,  in seven state emergency operations centers, and in Puerto Rico, providing around-the-clock coordination of  relief efforts.

Army Reserve units also conducted a variety of  less urgent community assistance  projects authorized when  the projects were within unit capabilities  and  could  provide  direct  training  in  mission-related  skills. In  FY  1998, Army  reservists  began road  construction at a  38-acre fish and wildlife area in Allamakee County, Iowa.  Other reservists used sling equipment to  mount a  decommissioned  F-4 Phantom jet aircraft at the entry  of the  Emporia,  Kansas,  airport  and  provided  showers  and  cold food  storage  for  twelve  hundred  girls,  ages  12- 18,  at the  International Girl  Scout  Jamboree  at  Marion  Lake, Kansas.  Still  another  project involved  building an outdoor amphitheater to seat three hundred people at the historical museum of Fort Missoula, Montana.  In  Colorado, Army reservists reroofed buildings, built parking lots, and renovated the Pawnee National  Grassland.  In Wyoming,  they  assisted with erosion control and helped prepare a site for a new school playground.

Defense  against  attacks  employing  weapons  of  mass  destruction (WMD) has  become  an  important  RC  mission  that  requires  extensive work  with  civil  authorities.  The  ARNG  established  ten  regional  rapid assessment, initial detection teams to respond to suspected or  actual attacks involving WMD.  State or federal  governments  could  send  these  teams to assess situations, advise the local commanders, and speed the flow  of requested DOD resources. Army Reserve soldiers worked on consequence› management issues at the DOD  level  to  ensure appropriate response to WMD incidents, using USAR and ARNG assets. As of September 1998, Army  Reserve  soldiers  had  provided  instruction  on WMD  defense  in twenty-two  U.S.  cities,  using  qualified  USAR  instructors.  During  FY 1998, USAR teams provided WMD instruction to federal partners in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S.  Customs Service, and the U.S. Probation  Department.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  Army  Reserve  Command hosted  and  participated  in  Exercise  WMD  CONSEQUENCE  MANAGEMENT 98,  simulating  a  terrorist  attack  on  Augusta,  Georgia.  The  DOD,  the Department  of Veterans  Affairs,  and  the  U.S.  Public  Health  Service developed the exercise to test the ability of the National Disaster Medical System to respond to a WMD disaster.

Another ongoing  area  of RC  support  to  civil  authorities  was  that  of counterdrug operations. During FY  1998, the ARNG continued to provide

vital assistance to law enforcement agencies and community-based organizations in  supp01t of  the president's National Drug  Control Strategy. The bulk of  the ARNG effort supported the governors' state plans for use of Guard personnel  in drug interdiction and drug demand-reduction activities. The Guard provides a wide range of  support to federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies: assisting with cargo inspection at ports of  entry, aerial and  ground  reconnaissance,  intelligence  analysis,  training,  constructing border  roads  and  fences,  and  producing  n1ore  than  thirty-three  thousand map products. Drug demand-reduction activities reached millions of  people through support to  community coalitions across America. During FY 1998 the ARNG provided 552,543 workdays in support of 13,212 missions.

The USAR conducted 158 counterdrug operations involving more than 350 soldiers in  FY  1998.  USAR support took a  variety of forms:  Reserve intelligence  persormel  supported  law  enforcement  agencies  with  analysis and  linguistic  skills.  The Army  Reserve  provided  aviation  support  in  the form  of reconnaissance aircraft.  USAR  troops  also  provided  maintenance for classified electronic equipment. Reserve engineers engaged in bridge and road  construction  to  support  U.S.  border  interdiction,  range construction, and crack-house demolition.

## Equipment and Maintenance

The  Army National  Guard  is  modernizing  its  equipment  to  fulfill  its state,  national,  and  international  missions.  Significant  initiatives  include modernization of  field artillery with M  109  A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer systems and the multiple launch rocket system (MLRS). The ARNG has been modernized with three Paladin-equipped battalions and was programmed to field  fifteen  more battalions through FY 200 I.  At the end of FY 1998, ten MLRS battalions were in the ARNG. Congress appropriated $95 million in FY 1998 for eighty M2A20DS Bradley infantry fighting vehicles for ARNG units.  Department of the Army  funding  paid  for acquisition  of Family  of Medium Tactical  Vehicles  trucks,  MLRSs,  Avenger  surface-to-air  missile systems,  MlAl  tanks,  single-channel  ground  and  airborne  radio  system (SINCGARS) radios, heavy equipment transporters, palletized load systems, M 16A3  rifles,  and  Volcano  scatterable  mine  systems. In  addition,  the ARNG used its own National Guard and Reserve Equipment Appropriation (NGREA) funds to purchase night-vision equipment, modification kits for UH-60Q medical evacuation helicopters, reverse-osmosis water purification units, dump trucks, Engagement Skills Trainers, five-ton  tractors, boresight equipment for  J\H- lF helicopters,  and  armor  fully  integrated  simulation trainers. Other significant equipment fielded to J\RNG units included M2J\O/ M3J\O  Bradley  fighting  vehicles, 120-mm  mortars,  and  the  All-Source Analysis System, as well as various training aids, devices, simulations, and

simulators.  The ARNG  received  several  thousand  M249  squad  automatic weapons (SAWs) in FY 1998 and  is  scheduled to  receive more than thirty thousand SAWs by FY 2003. This delivery will fill  80 percent of  the Army National Guard's  SAW requirement.

USAR  equipment  deliveries from active Army  units proceed in Department  of the  Army  Master  Priority  List  sequence.  This  procedure helped  the  highest-priority  units  field  equipment  compatible  with  that  of AC units, but low-priority units did not receive the equipment they needed to maintain  compatibility.  The  Army  procurement  budget  provided  the following  equipment  in  the  quantities  parenthetically  indicated  during FY 1998:  Advanced  Field Artillery Tactical  Data  System  (3),  All-Source Analysis  System (8),  all-terrain  cranes  (7),  Army  Global  Command-and› control  System  (2),  Global  Positioning  System  (Ground)  (4,654),  heavy equipment  transporters  (8), high-mobility trailers (381 ), M249  squad automatic  weapons  (6,589),  Maneuver  Control  System  (1),  protective masks (4,301), and SINCGARS radios (3,264). Many additional items were provided  from  Army  funds.  These  acquisitions  were  of new  equipment; cascading (that is, the transfer of  older equipment to the USAR from active Army units receiving new materiel) was minimal in FY 1998. As the active Army modernizes its weapon systems, the old systems are not distributed to the USAR but are cascaded to the ARNG.

The NGREA provides the USAR with the flexibility needed to pursue priority equipment acquisition, but the NGREA funding level still fell  short of essential  funding  for  equipment  requirements.  The  USAR  plans  for purchasing new equipment were  in  line  with known Army modernization plans in  FY 1998. These equipment purchases have helped overcome Army funding shortfalls by using NGREA funding to provide new equipment for USAR first-to-fight and fust-to-suppmt units. When mobilized, these units' soldiers  will  thus have  been  trained  on equipment compatible with  that of active units. The modernization trend in the RC had been positive until FY 1998,  but NGREA  funding  dropped  from  $113.7  million  in  FY  1997  to only $75 million in FY  1998. This reduction became a significant concern because the NGREA had provided the flexibility to modernize the USAR's combat support and combat service support equipment.

Equipment modification programs sustain the compatibility of RC and AC equipment. As budgets shrank and less in-use equipment was available for distribution to the RC, equipment modification programs represented an alternative way to extend the  service lif e,  reliability, and safety of  existing equipment.  Maintenance  requirements  became  even  more  critical  as  the RC  was tasked  to  perform more  missions.  Converting excess vehicles  to the correct configuration allowed  units  to  fill  shortages,  eliminate  excess vehicles,  and  improve readiness.  No  conversion programs were eliminated in  FY 1998 or planned for elimination in FY 1999.

The  USAR  M915A4  program  represents  a  typical  FY98  conversion initiative.  Under the program, M915 line haul tractors are refurbished with a  commercial  glider  kit.  The  glider  kit  program  uses  USAR  mechanics from  transportation  units,  working alongside civilian staff at  Fort McCoy, Wisconsin,  to  strip  down  deteriorated  vehicles  received  from  the  field. Vehicle support systems  are  replaced  with  parts  from  the  glider kit,  such as  the  frame,  front  axle,  brakes,  fuel  tanks,  air-conditioned  cab, electrical wiring,  and  other  replaceable  components.  The  result  is  an  almost-new vehicle,  designated M915A4. USAR soldiers receive hands-on experience and training while upgrading their units' vehicles, saving 55 percent of the cost of  purchasing new vehicles.  Plans call for  122 M915 line haul tractors to be upgraded in FY 1999, 122 in FY 2000, and 122 in FY 2001.

Use of  the M915 glider kit is only one example of  the USAR conversion strategy.  Conversions provide users with the latest technology inserted into used equipment at a fraction of  the cost of  new. In FY 1998, the Army Reserve converted seventeen five-ton cargo  vehicles to the drop-side configuration and sixteen 3/4-ton trailers  from the Ml01A2 model to the Ml01A3. Thirteen generators were converted  from gasoline to  diesel engines, and 133  high› mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs) were converted from M1037  shelter  carrier models  to  M998  hard-top  models.  All  conversions involved using equipment already owned by the USAR, rather than replacing old equipment with newer models.

The ARNG  conducted  a  variety  of its  own  equipment  modification programs  in  FY  1998. The ARNG  was  scheduled  to  convert 770 Ml037 HMMWV shelter carriers  to  M998  HMMWV  troop/cargo  trucks,  using conversion kits purchased in FY 1997, but the kits were not delivered until late in FY 1998; the resulting delay caused the conversion process to slip into FY 1999. The ARNG did convert 70 M996 HMMWV ambulances to M998 HMMWVs. The ARNG 2  1/2-ton  Extended Service Program,  previously funded  for  1,750 vehicles,  was suspended,  pending completion of a study (due  in  December  1998), of the desirability of outsourcing the  program's work. The  Army programmed $70 million in FY 1999 for modification of  the Bradley Fighting Vehicle System. ARNG maneuver battalions will receive a modern and more capable Bradley system that  will be compatible with the Bradleys found in AC combat maneuver battalions.

The USAR deployed  a  variety  of new  equipment  to  enhance  Army strategic  and  operational  mobility  in  FY  1998.  In  June  1998,  the  Army Reserve christened the Army's first  floating crane in Baltimore, Maryland. Named the Keystone State, this vessel  honors  the thirteen Army reservists from the 14th Quartermaster Detachment  based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, who were killed when an Iraqi Scud missile hit their barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, during Operation DESeRT STORM  in  1991. The floating crane has a lift capacity of 115 long tons and a 175-foot reach-enough to lift the

heaviest  Army cargo. The Keystone State belongs to the 949th Transportation Company  (Floating  Craft)  in  Baltimore.  The  USAR  rolled  out  its  new HEMTT common btidge transporter in August  1998. The transporter is  a remanufactured truck with enhanced capability to transport simultaneously a  float  bridge  and  a  fixed  bridge.  As  a  result,  float  and  fixed  bridge  units can  be  consolidated  into  multi-role  bridge  companies. The  USAR  459th Engineer  Company  in  Clarksburg,  West  Virginia,  became  the  fu·st  such bridge company in the Army.

FY J 998 saw the conclusion of  the RETROEUR (European Retrograde of Equipment)  Program,  in  which  the Army  National  Guard  redeployed, repaired, and redistributed excess active Army  equipment from the drawdown of U.S.  forces  in  Europe. The program had six repair sites with various  specializations:  Santa Fe,  New  Mexico  (wheeled  vehicles);  Camp Shelby,  Mississippi (wheeled and  tracked  equipment);  Fort Riley,  Kansas (wheeled  and  tracked  equipment);  Piketon,  Ohio  (wheeled  vehicles  and engineer equipment); Fort Indiantown Gap, Permsylvania (wheeled vehicles and  Bradley  fighting  vehicles);  and  Clackamas,  Oregon  (communication and electronic equipment). The program's  redistribution facility was located at Lexington, Kentucky.  Of the program's 450 employees, 75 percent were ARNG soldiers and 25 percent were civilians. Most of the ARNG soldiers were  state  employees  reimbursed  with  federal  funds,  whereas  most  of the  civilians  were  employed  at  Fort  Indiantown  Gap  and  Clackamas  as temporary federal employees. As of 30 September 1998, RETROEUR sites had received  8,968  vehicles,  17,642  pieces of communication-electronics equipment,  and  $413.5  million  worth  of excess  nonrolling  stock  such as  freight  containers.  The total  value of all  the  equipment exceeded $2.6 billion. The equipment repaired included trucks, trailers, MlAl tanks, M113 night sights, and other miscellaneous electronic equipment. By the end of the  program,  6,948  vehicles and  11 ,850 communication-electronics  items received  had  been repaired  successfully  and  excess  equipment valued  at $333.7 million had been redistributed. In addition, the ARNG repaired and redistributed more than $2 billion worth of  equipment at the direction of  the U.S.  Army Materiel Command.  Cascading will remain the primary source of  equipment for ARNG lower-priority units. Because of  the availability of cascaded equipment, equipment on hand is no  longer the primary factor in determining  unit  readiness  standards. The Army  Reserve  received  only  a small amount of  equipment in FY 1998 as a result of  AC downsizing.

The  Integrated  Sustainment  Maintenance  (ISM)  Program  aims  to integrate the capacities and capabilities of the active Army, the USAR, and the  ARNG  into  one  repair  program,  focusing  on  rebuilding  components using  production-line  methods  at central  locations  instead  of performing local  repairs  or  purchasing  new  components.  ISM  uses  a  competitive bidding process to award repair contracts of specific components to centers

of excellence  (COE).  The  COEs  for  the  ARNG  operate  out of existing maintenance  facilities,  using existing tools  and test equipment. The Guard is  phasing its  program in over a  two-year period in  each of its eight local sustainment management areas. At the end of FY 1998, the second year of program patticipation, ARNG  COEs  were  repairing 222  area  component lines for area states, 71  regional lines  for all Army components within two continental U.S. regions, and 1  national line for one of  the  Army's  commodity commands. Because of the strong support from the field,  ISM allowed the ARNG to avoid costs of$8.3 million in FY 1998.

During FY 1998, a one-year pilot  program demonstrated the applicability of controlled-humidity preservation (CHP) teclmology to  the ARNG,  and the  National  Guard  Bureau  became  the Army's lead  agent  for  CHP.  The ARNG  CHP  program  was  designed  to  offset  maintenance  requirements by  reducing  required  services  and  repairs  of equipment  not  required  for training on a recurring basis. The original vision for CHP anticipated placing 25  percent of  selected equipment (with emphasis on technically advanced and maintenance-intensive items) into CHP shelters for a three-year period. When stored in  controlled conditions, the equipment would be considered ready, and all maintenance services would be deferred until withdrawal from storage.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

The Army is  implementing a Revolution in Military Logistics (RML), a  multiyear transition  of  Army  logistics  from  a  system  relying  on mass  to one  based  on  velocity,  mobility,  and  information.  Battlefield  operations projected  for  Army  XXI  and  later  forces  mandate a  streamlined  logistics structure, reduced demand, less weight and volume of  supplies, and reduced time between demand for and provision of  supplies. The RML should meet these  needs  by  reengineering  logistics  practices  and  exploiting  advances in information technology to reduce overall demand while maintaining the effectiveness of  forces in the field.

Since  1995,  the  velocity  management  (VM)  program  has  been  the Army's  vehicle for reengineering its logistics practices. Velocity management comprehensively  examines  Army  logistical  processes  with  the  intent  of improving the  flow of  materiel and information  through the logistics system by substituting velocity (the rapid delivery of  materiel from the wholesale level) for mass (large stockpiles of  materiel at  the unit level).  The  VM program aims to achieve this improvement by finding and eliminating sources of  delay and inefficiency in  logistics processes to get supplies to the soldier as quickly as possible. Velocity management has marked a major change in Army logistic practice. Tradjtionally, the logistics system has been thought of  by function, such as ordnance, transportation, or quartermaster. By contrast, VM looks at logistics  by  specific process  (for example, the processes of ordering and receiving a spare part or of  repairing a piece of  equipment). These processes cut across functions. VM can be thought of  as managing logistics by process, with an emphasis on streamlining the constituent processes of  the logistical system,  reducing  the time  it  takes  to  perform basic processes,  improving quality, and lowering costs.

The Velocity Group oversees the VM program. In FY 1998, the group consisted  of a  consortium  of senior Army  logisticians jointly  chaired  by the  deputy  chief of staff for  logistics,  the  deputy  commanding general of the Army Materiel Command (AM  C), and the commanding general of the Combined Arms Support Command.  Membership included senior leaders from the Office of  the Deputy Chief of  Staff  for Logistics (ODCSLOG); the Army Forces Command; the AMC; the Training and Doctrine Command; the

U.S.  Army Europe (USAREUR); the Eighth  U.S. Army, Korea (EUSAK); the Defense Logistics Agency;  the General  Services Administration;  the Military  Traffic  Management  Command;  and  the  U.S.  Transportation Command. VM process improvement teams and site improvement teams led by senior logisticians were established at all active and reserve component organizations. The Velocity  Group  initially  focused  on five  Class IX,  or spare parts, processes: ordering, shipping, repair, stockage requirements, and financial management. These processes were chosen for their potential for systemwide improvement. Before VM got under way, order- ship time (that is, the length of  time between placement  of  a wholesale part order and the part's availability to the customer) averaged twenty days. The Velocity Group's initial  goal  was  to  reduce  this  time  to  seven  to  ten  days,  even for  routine orders. Application of velocity management techniques led to synchronized cycle times, provided dedicated transportation support, and eliminated wasted time in the supply and distribution chains. As a result, several  continental  U.S.  (CONUS)  installations reduced  average  order› ship  time to  six  to  nine days.  Shipment times to the  USAREUR and the EUSAK were cut in  half,  averaging  16  and  14.5  days,  respectively. The key  to  improvement in order- ship time  was  the fielding,  throughout the Army, of the Standard Army Retail Supply System-Objective (SARSS-0) and related automatic identification technology.

Army Total Asset Visibility  (ATAV)  is  a  comprehensive  U.S.  Army initiative that furnishes managers throughout the  Army with information on the location, quantity, condition, and movement of  materiel assets retrieved from existing and emerging automated systems worldwide. The ATAV  is supported by automatic identification technology, such as radio frequency technology,  laser optical technology,  and bar coding. These technologies enable Army logisticians to  monitor cargo movements, divert shipments, locate  critical  supplies, and  eliminate  human  error. Radio  frequency automatic identification technology was used to provide visibility of  critical assets during  TURI30CADS (Containerized Ammunition Distribution System) 98  and  other  recent exercises.  Radio  frequency  automatic  identification technology has been implemented throughout Europe and continued in use in support of  Operation JoiNT FORGE in Bosnia. The Army also completed radio  frequency  implementation  in  Korea  in  FY  1998.  The  Automated Manifest System uses optical memory cards to enhance receipt processing of freight manifest multi  pack forms at Army installations. The system has been implemented as a stand-alone version at central receiving points and as an integrated capability within the SARSS-0 at direct support units. In FY 1998,  the ATAV extended to more than three million National Stock Number items for managers throughout the Army and the Department of Defense (DOD). In support of  the Lateral Redistribution and Procurement Offset Initiative (directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense), the

ATAV provided asset data to all the armed services and the Defense Logistics Agency.

The Army has also been integrating automatic identification technology, in the form of  radio frequency tags as well as bar coding, into the ammunition business  process. Automatic identification teclmology was introduced to  maximize  source  data  automation  and  provide  in-transit  visibility  of ammunition assets being transported to ammunition supply points (ASPs). A prototype test of  the integration of  automatic identification teclmology (AIT) into  the ammunition  supply system was successfully completed  in August 1998. This test involved Crane Army Ammunition Activity (Indiana), and the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point (North Carolina) in the continental United States, and the port at Nordenham, the Miesau Storage Activity, and Ammunition Supply Points 1 and 8 in Germany. The Army expected to extend Ammunition/AIT  integration  to  additional  ASPs  and Tier  1  ammunition depots in FY 1999. Implementation at remaining ASPs, ammunition depots, ports, and plants will be contingent on the availability of  funds.

During  FY  1998,  the  DOD  built upon  the Army  successes  achieved through use of  automatic identification technology. The DOD  AIT operational prototype, sponsored by the U.S.  European Command, focused on four activities:  unit movement, seavan (container shipping operations), air cargo, and ammunition supply. Key benefits expected from the prototype were  easier  distribution  of assets  contributing  to  reduced  inventory  and receipt processing time,  improved content visibility and tracking of theater sustainment shipments, and  improved  visibility of in-theater truck convoy and rail  movements. In addition, the application of automatic identification was  expected  to  yield  improved  source  data  accuracy,  increased  nodal throughput, and increased potential interoperability with commercial vendors and shippers through the use of  a commercial standard shipping label.

As the Army reorients its forces  from  forward deployment to CONUS basing,  the AMC  is  introducing a  distribution-based system  for  logistical support to decrease reliance on forward stockpiles. Automated networks of high-speed processors linked by satellite communications will tie the system together, providing tracking and access at all levels as well as global direct distribution.  In  FY  1998,  the  AMC  formulated  requirements  and  began issuing  requests  for  proposals for  several  information  systems supporting distribution-based logistics. Army Electronic Product Support will establish a single point of  entry for all AMC Web-based logistic functions. Through this effort, theAMC will provide full automation of  requisitioning interfaces, including finance, and will link customers to AMC inventories and catalogs. The Logistics Integrated Data Base is anAMC project to combine information on  readiness,  maintenance, supplies, pipelines, and assets into a  relational database that provides Web-based access to logistics information at a single site,  rather than requiring separate access to  the current sixty-six  separate

databases. The Global Combat  Support  System-Army  (GCSS-Army) will  provide  an  integrated  tool  for  Army, joint,  and  allied  combat service support operations. This system involves three main elements: retail logistics modernization;  wholesale  and  retail  logistics  integration,  which  includes wholesale logistics modernization; and joint logistical interoperability.

As a part of  the GCSS-Anny, the AMC intends the Wholesale Logistics Modernization  Program  (WLMP)  to  modernize  the  Army's  information management  system  for  wholesale  logistics  and  to  restructure  business practices at the wholesale and installation levels  through  adoption of best commercial  practices  and  their  associated  information  technology.  The WLMP will exploit advances in information technology to achieve a single Army logistics business system and will establish  a long-term  partnership with industry. After receiving general approval from the deputy undersecretary of defense for logistics in April  1998, the AMC revised the initial draft request for  proposals for the WLMP,  made notification to  Congress, and  issued a restructured draft request for proposals in September 1998.

In  November 1997, the vice chief  of  staff,  Army, approved  a campaign plan for the Single Stock Fund (SSF), a crucial part of logistical modernization. The  Army  intends  the  SSF  to  consolidate  existing  retail  and  wholesale stock funds into one vertically integrated account for more efficient use of resources. In January 1998, the ODCSLOG organized  a program management office located at AMC headquarters. The AMC has been designated the SSF national manager.

Over the years,  installations  and  major  commands  have  developed  a number of  automated central  issue facility (CIF)  systems, and  a single  standard Army-wide  system  has  been  needed  to  improve  their  management.  The purpose of  the CIF Installation Support Module is to provide a standardized Army-wide, automated, user-friendly system for the receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and turn-in of authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment  at  Army  installations.  The  program  manager-sustaining  base automation has been developing the CIF module. As a result of  significant problems identified when the CIF module was fielded to F01t Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield,  Georgia, it was returned to development in October 1997. All problems that would either stop or  hamper CIF missions were either fixed or  had available acceptable  procedures to accommodate problems before completion of the software acceptance test in March 1998. A configuration control board chaired by the program manager-sustaining base automation reviewed less-serious problems on 31 March 1998 and assigned priorities for their solution.  By the time the configuration control  board convened,  work had begun on accommodating CIF annexes within the system data structure, a  feature needed  before the USAREUR could accept the module. The first two priorities agreed to by the configuration control board were remediation of potential Year 2000  problems  and  changing population-based stockage

requirements.  At the  end  of the  fiscal  year,  work  on accommodating  CIF annexes  and  remedies  for  potential Year 2000  issues  continued,  but there were not enough funds to begin work on changing the method of  computing stockage  requirements. An aggressive  fielding  schedule  was  developed, calling for fielding the module to all CIFs worldwide (except the USAREUR) by the end of  March 1999. The USAREUR's fielding schedule depended on development of  suppott for CIF annexes.

## Maintenance

The program manager for test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (PM-TMDE), at the direction  of  a  TMDE  General Officer  Steering  Committee, drafted the Army Diagnostic Improvement Program (ADIP) Master Plan on 24  October  1997. This plan outlined a  strategy to  reduce significantly the cost of equipment operations and support (O&amp;S) by centrally coordinating efforts through the PM-TMDE, and proposed to maximize O&amp;S cost savings by coordinating the horizontal technology integration of  the ADIP into all of the newly developing systems and into as many existing systems as feasible. The ADIP Master Plan was released and posted on the ADIP homepage for review and comment by all  Army organizations. The General Officer Steering Committee endorsed the strategy of  horizontal technology integration, which would lead to embedded sensors and built-in test capability. The objective was to improve current weapons system diagnostics, establish a strategy for future systems to use embedded diagnostics, and minimize external testing.

The ODCSLOG briefed the chief of staff, Army,  in  February 1998 on a  funding  strategy and policy  that would  accelerate the ADIP.  Since then, the PM-TMDE,  the Maintenance  Policy Division of the  ODCSLOG,  and the Force Development for Logistics Division of the  Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and  Plans have  been developing  policy  and programming funds for this initiative. In the short term, the integrated fami ly of  test equipment enjoyed a high level of  funding for the 2000- 05 Program Objective Memorandum.  For the  long  term,  in April  1998  the  vice chief of staff, Army,  signed an accelerated application of embedded diagnostics policy  memorandum that directed  the combat and  materiel  developers to coordinate their embedded diagnostics plan for new and retrofitted equipment with the PM-TMDE. In addition, the Army acquisition executive signed a policy  directing  major  weapons  system  program  managers  to  coordinate their embedded diagnostics plans with the PM-TMDE.

Depot maintenance is the Army's  strategic maintenance sustainment base and is the only source of  supply for fully reconditioned or overhauled major pieces  of equipment  or end  items.  For approximately one-fourth the  cost of new  equipment procurements, these end items fill equipment shortages, modernize  the  force,  and  ensure  the  equipment  readiness  of the  Army's

warfighting commanders  in  chief. The Army's arsenals, depots, and plants have always played important roles in developing and maintaining weapons and other equipment, as well as supplying many of  the basic weapons needed by  the Army. Since the end of World  War II, the number of Army-owned maintenance depots  has declined.  When the  recommendations of the  1993 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission were implemented in 1997, only five maintenance depots and eight ammunition plants remained in the Army depot system. With a few exceptions, such as Watervliet, New York, and Rock Island, Illinois, the primary role of  Army depot facilities has generally  evolved  into  one  of rebuilding  and  maintenance. The pressures of sharply  lower defense budgets  and  reductions  in military  procurement have  led  to  changes  in the  accepted  policy for  dividing  work between the government and the  private sectors.  Both sectors are shrinking, so that the rebuilding and overhauling work previously performed almost exclusively in  government facilities  has  become more appealing to  the private sector. For FY  1998,  the Army had  a  funding  requirement of $1.359  billion  for its  depots.  Of this  total  requirement,  only  $819.897  million  was  funded, leaving an unfunded requirement of $539.780 million, or a funding rate of 60 percent.

## Sustainability

The  Army requires sufficient outloading infrastructure to project quickly a  CONUS-based  force  with  its  associated  equipment  and  ammunition. Therefore, Forces Command,  through the authority of  Headquarters, Department  of  the  Army,  designated  15 installations, 14 airfields, 17 strategic seaports, and 11  ammunition plants and depots as power projection platforms  to  support  this  mission.  To  meet  force  projection  requirements identified  in  the  DOD  Mobility  Requirements  Study  of  1992  and  the I 995 Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update, the Army Strategic Mobility Program (ASMP)  has identified and assigned priorities to infrastructure improvements at these power  projection platforms. ASMP infrastructure  initiatives include upgrading  airfields,  improving rail and  containerization  facilities,  and  constructing  warehousing  and  other installation-specific projects. FY98 projects included major improvements in the Naval Weapons Station Concord's ability to transship Army ammunition containers;  construction  of an  Arrival/Depatture  Airfield  Control  Group complex at Fort Bragg,  North  Carolina,  and  a  pre-positioning  facility  at Charleston, South Carolina; and  improvement in container facilities  at the Crane (Indiana) and Blue Grass (Kentucky) Army Ammunition Depots. The Army has programmed sufficient resources  to  improve  its  ability  to  meet established deployment timelines for contingencies up to two major theater wars.

Based on the Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update, Army strategic sealift needed  19 large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off ships (LMSRs); 31  roll-on/roll-off  ships; 8 fast sealift ships; 6 crane ships; 2 heavy lift pre-positioning ships; 3 lighter aboard ships; and 2 container ships. These ships would enable deployment of a five-division corps within seventy-five days. The LMSR program involved acquisition offourteen newly built ships plus conversion offive ships, to provide a total of  nineteen ships much larger and more efficient than current Ready Reserve Force roll-on/roll-off ships. The five  conversion LMSRs were already  in service.  Four of the five  are loaded with Army Pre-positioned Stocks-3 (APS-3) equipment stationed in the Persian Gulf. The one remaining conversion LMSR was assigned to the Navy surge sealift program. Three of  the fourteen new-construction LMSRs have  been  delivered,  with  one (the Watson) loaded  with  APS-3  cargo  and positioned in the Persian Gulf.  Of the  fourteen  new-construction LMSRs, eight have  been  programmed  to  support the Army's afloat pre-positioning program by FY 200 I. The Navy is expected to have five conversion LMSRs and six new-construction LMSRs in the surge sealift program. The plan for moving pre-positioned equipment from the older ships to the new ones (the trans  load plan) consists of  three phases. As of the end of  FY  1998, Phase I, the transload of  combat and combat support equipment from seven interim Ready Reserve Force roll-on/roll-off ships to five  conversion LMSRs,  had been  completed.  Phase II,  the  loading  of the  first  four  new-construction LMSRs  with  additional combat  support  and combat  service support equipment, was under way. Phase III, the cross-loading of  equipment from the five conversion LMSRs to four new-construction LMSRs, was expected to be completed in FY 200 I.

Army  watercraft are  key  elements  in  the  logistical  support of  power projection.  More  than  90  percent  of  the  materials  required to sustain operating  forces  are  transported  by  strategic  sealift.  U.S.  Army  watercraft provide the means to transfer that cargo  from  strategic sealift ships to  the shore in Logistics Over-the-Shore (LOTS) operations. LOTS operations arc conducted to ensure that strategic sealift can be off-loaded when fixed ports arc inadequate, unavailable, or denied by enemy action. When conducted in conjunction with the U.S.  Navy, these operations are known as Joint LOTS. In  FY  1998,  the  Army  watercraft  inventory  consisted  of 252  pieces  of equipment, including landing craft; causeway systems; and utility craft, such as tugboats, floating cranes, and barges. To  make these assets more useful, pre-positioning of  watercraft aboard three ships of  the APS-3 fleet, known as the Port Opening Package (POP), continued. The Army placed landing craft, tugboats, and a limited number of  modular causeway sections aboard these vessels.  During FY  1998,  the  Military  Sealift  Command  leased  a  second heavy sealift pre-positioned ship for the Army.  Carrying four landing craft, utility (LCU-2000), plus associated gear for watercraft transportation units,

this ship joined the other two ships in the POP. The LCU-2000s each have a cargo-carrying capability of  350 short tons.

In addition to watercraft aboard the POP, the Army planned to forward› station other assets  in the Central Command (CENTCOM) and  the Pacific Command (PACOM) areas of  responsibility. A swing strategy for watercraft. stationing would provide a combination  of  thirty-five craft for the CENT  COM or the  PACOM  area  of responsibility  to  complete  the  off-loading  of the Army heavy btigade afloat and to  conduct other LOTS and/or Joint LOTS operations. Twenty-five watercraft systems were to be located aboard the POP and ten craft each located in the CENTCOM and the PACOM corrunanders› in-chiefs' areas  of responsibility.  The  main current program  shortfall was the lack of  sufficient roll-on/roll-off discharge facilities (RRDFs) aboard the POP. The RRDF supplies the interface platform between  Army lighterage and strategic sealift ships (roll-on/roll-off) in  LOTS  or Joint LOTS  operations. The Army used FY98 funds to procure additional RRDF causeway sections and ancillary  equipment so as  to  have  this  capability aboard  the  POP  or aboard other APS-3  ships,  and  it expected to  resolve  this  shortfall  by  FY 2000.

## Security Assistance

The solid relationship built between the Army and its Western European counterparts helped to avert a diplomatic crisis between the U.S.  and Swiss governments during FY 1998. In  1997, the Department of State concluded that the government of  Switzerland exported upgrade kits for M 1  09-series self-propelled howitzers (technology that the Swiss procured from  the U.S. Army) to the Netherlands without the consent of  the U.S.  government. The howitzer  upgrade kits  were destined for  a  Dutch manufacturer upgrading eighty-five howitzers for the United  Arab Emirates. The unauthorized transfer of  the gun tube technology violated the  Arms Export Control Act, the Stratton Amendment (protection of  cannon technology produced at Watervliet), and a  memorandum  of understanding  concerning  the  U.S.  government/Swiss Howitzer Co-Production Upgrade Program. The Department of  State notified Congress of  the violation, and the U.S. government lodged complaints with both the Swiss government and the Netherlands concerning the unauthorized transfer.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Undersecretary  of  Defense  (Acquisition and Technology)  solicited  the  Army's support  in  reaching  a  compromise agreement with the Swiss to mitigate the impact of  the unauthorized transfer. The Office of  the Deputy Undersecretary of  the Army (International Affairs) (ODUSA-IA), in concert with the AMC and Watervliet Arsenal, entered into formal negotiations with the Swiss Defense Procurement  Agency to develop a  compensation  package  for  work  lost to  Watervliet Arsenal  through  the

Swiss unauthorized transfer and to mediate the impact of the maneuver on future  defense  programs  with  the  Swiss.  After  months of negotiations,  in March  1998 a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case, valued at$4 million, was presented to the Swiss government to transfer workload associated with the machining of the muzzle brakes and the 47-caliber barrels of  the Swiss guns to Watervliet Arsenal.  In  addition, an agreement was signed establishing a work  -sharing arrangement between the U.S. government, United Defense (the U.S.  howitzer  manufacturer), and Swiss Ordnance Enterprise  Corporation applying to any future third-country sales of  upgraded M I  09 self-propelled howitzers armed with the Swiss 47-caliber cannon.

In  1998,  Turkey  released  its  ten-year  modernization  plan,  with  the procurement  of a  modernized  tank  as  its  cornerstone.  Turkey  expressed interest  in  the  MlA2 Abrams  tank. The ODUSA-IA,  in  conjunction  with the prime contractor, General Dynamics Land Systems Division, established a  steering committee to approach the Turkish government on the potential sale  and  to begin developing a strategy to respond  to the potential Turkish request for proposals. The Turkish requirement called for the procurement of one  thousand  tank  systems  (with  indigenous  production,  possibly  two thousand) and the  upgrade of thirteen hundred existing M60  tanks  with  a 120-mm gun. The estimated sales  value  of this  program  was  between  $5 billion and $7 billion. Like Turkey, Greece also identified a requirement for a modernized main battle tank, initiating an international competition among France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States for the sale of 246 tanks with an estimated sales value of  $1  bi Ilion.

In  1998, the ODUSA-IA and the Raytheon Company crafted a strategy for the commercial sale of  the Patriot PAC-3 and Patriot Guidance-Enhanced Missiles to Greece, with a sales value estimated at $1 .2 billion. The strategy included the creative use of  excess defense articles, security assistance leases, and the spearheading of an interagency- industry working group to achieve consensus on technology transfer issues as well as guidance to the company on the  feasibility of Raytheon's approach to pricing and offsets (reciprocal purchases from the customer  nation).  This  was the first international competition in which the Patriot PAC-3 competed directly against a similar Russian system.

The nations in the Pacific Rim  continued to  express an  interest in  procuring U.S. Army weapons systems. Taiwan topped the list in dollar value of open FMS agreements.  In March  1998,  the government of Singapore officiaJly submitted a request to procure eight Apache Longbow helicopters equipped with  three  fire-control  radars  (FCRs),  along  with  130  Hellfire  missiles, for a sales value estimated at $340 million.  Ensuing discussion among the Army Staff principals  (the Office of the  Assistant Secretary  of the Army for  Acquisitions,  Logistics,  and  Technology;  the  ODUSA-IA;  the  Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence; and the Office of the Deputy

Chief of Staff for Operations and  Plans) lasted  longer than six  months.  At the center of the debate were issues surrounding the first-time  introduction into  the region  of the advanced  capability  of the  FCR and  the  nature  of external  threats  to  Singapore.  Congress was  notified  of the  potential  sale of  the Apache Longbow, minus the FCR. The notification period concluded in September 1998 with no congressional opposition. A decision was made to  notify  Congress  of the potential sale of the  FCR  when the  outstanding proliferation issues are resolved within the DOD.

In the Middle East, the ODUSA-IA dealt with a far different problem› one of  tremendous magnitude for the Army's defense industrial base. Saudi Arabia, the Army's  largest FMS purchaser, had begun to experience financial difficulties and was unable to  make its quatterly deposits to the FMS trust fund, from  which  U.S.  defense  manufacturers  and  government  activities are  reimbursed  for  goods  and  services.  In  May 1998,  representatives from  the  Saudi  Ministries of Finance and  Foreign Procurement met with representatives of the  ODUSA-IA, along with representatives of the other services, to project Saudi financial disbursements for the  remainder of the fiscal  year. The Saudi officials informed the U.S.  government that funding for the remainder of the  calendar year would  be severely constrained. The Army  initiated  a  comprehensive  review  of all  Saudi  FMS  agreements  to scale back or delay the  procurements  in order to maintain the integrity of these programs. As FY 1998 drew to a close, the Saudi financial crisis had worsened, with the Saudi trust fund at its lowest level in recent history. The survival of  ongoing programs was totally dependent on last-minute deposits by the Saudi government.

In Kuwait,  the  ODUSA-IA  struggled to  complete two  major defense sales agreements with  a total  sales value in excess of $1.2 billion.  In early 1998, the Kuwaiti government sought to purchase sixteen Apache Longbow helicopters, including six FCR sets, with an estimated sales value of $850 million.  The process was delayed  by a  Kuwaiti  request  for  a  line-by-line review of the case and  a number of configuration changes. The fiscal  year closed with an agreement still pending. In addition, Kuwait submitted a letter of request to  procure  forty-eight Ml  09A6 Paladin  155-mm self-propelled howitzers, with an estimated sales value of $400 million.  In  1997, Kuwait had equipped one of its artillery battalions with a Chinese-made howitzer; however,  a  requirement  still  existed  to  equip  two  additional  battalions. The  ODUSA-IA and United  Defense,  the  prime  manufacturer, continued to  stress  the  importance  of Kuwaiti  selection  of the  Paladin  to  maintain coalition compatibility. To meet the Kuwaiti requirement for a howitzer with a firing range of  40 km., United Defense offered to replace the standard 39caliber gun tube with a 52-caliber tube. The United Defense offer, combined with U.S. government supp01t and the Operation DESE RT THUNDER buildup, prompted the Kuwaiti minister of defense to dispatch a team  to  the United

States to  reevaluate  the Paladin.  From 26 February to  10 March  1998,  the delegation  toured  the  United  Defense  facilities  at  York  and  Letterkenny, Pennsylvania, and  observed firing  demonstrations of the 52-caliber tube al Aberdeen Proving Ground. The delegation was pleased by the discussions and impressed by the firing demonstrations. By the end of  the fiscal year, the Kuwaiti Ministry ofDefense had selected the Paladin to satisfy its artillery requirements and had forwarded the decision to the Kuwaiti Parliament for ratification.

In Jordan,  a  different  scenario  continued to play out. Presidentially  directed U.S. Army drawdowns (transfers of  redundant U.S. military equipment) have been key to the sustainment  of  the Jordanian military, with a drawdown valued at $100 million in  1996, $25 million in 1997, and an additional $25 million in 1998. During the late King Hussein's  visit to Washington, D.C., on 17-20 March  1998, he discussed the Jordanian military requirements directly with Secretary of  Defense WilliamS. Cohen. Army-managed items requested by Jordan  for  inclusion in  the  1998  drawdown  were  14  M90 I TOW  carriers, 1,225 AN/PRC-77 radios,  100  Hawk rocket motors, 3.7  million rounds of 7.62-mm ammunition, and spare and repair parts for equipment previously provided to  Jordan under FMS or drawdown authorities. The value of the Army's contribution to  this  effort was  estimated  at $13.4  million,  and the Army was directed to execute the deliveries on 1 May  1998. At the close of the fiscal year, deliveries were ongoing.

## Research, Development,  Test, and Evaluation

The  actual  FY97  Army  budget  for  research,  development,  test,  and evaluation  (ROTE)  was  $4.9  billion.  The  estimated  ROTE  obligational authority for FY 1998 was slightly higher ($5 billion) with a decrease to $4.8 billion projected for FY  1999. Total obligational authority for procurement subsequent to ROTE was $8.1  billion  for FY 1997, estimated to  decrease significantly  to  $6.9  billion  for  FY 1998 and projected to  recover to $8.2 billion for FY 1999.

Information  dominancethe  degree  of  information  superiority  that enables Army forces to use information systems and capabilities to achieve an operational advantage while denying those capabilities to an adversaty› was a major near-term focus of  Army ROTE activity. The Army in FY 1998 tested a number of new or upgraded systems that contribute to information dominance. The Army  Data Distribution  System,  including the Enhanced Position  Location  Reporting  System  and  the  Near-Term  Digital  Radio System, successfully supported the division advanced warfighting experiment in November 1998 and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below (FBCB2) limited user test (LUT)  in August 1998. The FBCB2  is  a digital battle  command  information  system  intended  to  provide  commanders,

leaders,  and  soldiers  with  improved  command-and-control  and  enhanced situational awareness. The FBCB2 consists primarily of  software but is also expected  to  include  a  ruggedized  computer for  those  users  and  platforms without an existing computer system. The LUT was conducted  from  3  to 21  August 1998, at Fort Hood, Texas, with a battalion task force.  Opposing force and passive electronic warfare systems were included to provide stress on the unit's operational use of the FBCB2. The purposes of  the LUT were to confirm that solutions to problems identified during the Task Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment were in place and to  verify that the new tactical  Internet architecture improved  digital  and  voice  communications. Developmental Test-1  was conducted from May through June 1998 at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to  examine system performance and readiness for the subsequent  LUT.  This  test  employed  sixty-one  FBCB2-equipped  nodes, including fourteen mobile platforms.

Development of improved  artillery  fire-control  systems  continued  in FY  1998. The  1997 version of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System)intended to provide integrated, automated support for planning, coordinating, and controlling all fire support assets (field artillery,  mortars, close air support, naval gunfire,  and attack helicoptersalso completed its limited user test in October 1997, with release of  the system on 22 July 1998. The Block II  upgrade  program  for  the  Firefinder  (TPQ-36  and TPQ-37) artillery-locating  radar  reached the  Milestone II decision point  for progression into  engineering  and  manufacturing  development  in  October  1997.  The upgrade program was expected to double previous range performance (out to 60 kilometers for the TPQ-37), and provide a new capability for detecting rockets and missiles at ranges from 150 to 300 kilometers. The  Army required the enhanced Firefinder system to be capable of  roll-on/roll-off deployment from a single C-130 transport aircraft.  Crew size was  to  be  reduced  from twelve to eight.

The  Long-Range  Advanced Scout  Surveillance  System (LRAS3) integrates a second-generation forward-looking infrared system with long› range optics, an eye-safe laser range finder, a day video camera, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with platform attitude determination. The LRAS3 can provide armor and infantry scout platoons with a sensor system capable of  detecting targets at three times the range of  the currently fielded ANffAS-6 night observation device, long range. The  first  LRAS3  system produced in  the  engineering and  manufacturing development phase of the program was delivered in June 1998, with production qualification testing to run through November 1998.

The  Army  also  launched  several  information  dominance  Advanced Concept Technology  Demonstrations  (ACTDs) and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) inFY 1998. The  Air/Land Enhanced Reconnaissance and Targeting ATD, slated to run through 200  l , demonstrated on-the-move,

automatic-aided target acquisition and enhanced identification  using a suite of  second-generation forward-looking infrared and laser sensors. Data from the  sensor suite were  to  be  fused  to  reduce  false  alarms  and  to  enhance target identification. The Multi-Function Staring Sensor Suite (MFS3) ATD integrated  multiple advanced  sensors,  including a  staring  infrared imager, a  multifunction laser,  and acoustic arrays  to provide  noncooperative target recognition  (the  ability  to  classify  targets  as  friendly  or  hosti le  without recourse to an identification signal), incoming fire location, and air defense against  low-signature  or stealthy  tlu·eats.  The  MFS3  supports  the  Future Cavalry Scout System, Future Infantry Vehicle, and Future Combat System. The Multi-Mission Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sensor ATD was expected to demonstrate modular and interchangeable payloads employing electro-optic/ infrared, multispectral,  and  integrated  moving-target  indicator/synthetic› aperture radar sensors  for  future  tactical  and  short-range u1m1anned  aerial vehicles. These sensors, coupled with ground station automated processing, have  been  designed  to provide  enhanced  recotmaissance,  surveillance, battle damage assessment, and targeting for brigades and smaller maneuver forces.

A  second  thrust  of Army  ROTE  efforts  has  involved  the  continuing development  of overmatching  combat capabilities  to  exploit  information dominance.  The  Army  defines overmatch as  a  substantial  advantage  in combat  capabilities  over  current  and  potential  opponents  by  virtue  of superior  combat  systems  that  employ  advanced  technologies.  A  major element of  Army overmatch lies in the development of  improved deep attack capabilities. The  Army  Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Block IA extends the range of  the Block I ATACMS by reducing the original payload from 950 to 300 bomblets and adding a GPS receiver to the existing inertial guidance system to provide the necessary accuracy at the increased ranges thus made possible. The Army Training and Doctrine Command coordinated a sensor› to-shooter assessment  of existing  test  and  exercise data  to  determine  the Army's capability to detect targets at the Block IA ranges and its ability to process the information in a timely manner. Also, the XVIII Airborne Corps demonstrated targeting for deep attack in the January  1998 PURPLE  DRAGON joint exercise.

The  Army  has  also  undertaken  development  of a  further  generation of the  ATACMS,  Blocks  II  and  IIA,  intended  to  deliver  BAT  (Brilliant Antiarmor,  formerly Brilliant Anti-Tank) precision-guided submunitions at long range. The BAT submunitions then use acoustic and infrared sensors to detect and engage moving tanks and other armored vehicles autonomously. Block II  missiles cany thirteen BATs;  Block IIA  missiles carry a  smaller payload of  six BATs to  longer range. ATACMS Block II and IIA completed preproduction  test  flights  in  April  1998,  with  successful  engagement  of moving  tank  targets  by  all  dispensed  BAT  submunitions  in  each  flight.

Production qualification tests began in August 1998. The BAT submunition itself was also in development, having completed contractor development test  flights  in  March  1998.  A  version  incorporating  preplanned  product improvements successfully completed its first captive flight test in February 1998. The improvements included enhanced target-acquisition capabilities and a warhead useful against a wider range of  targets.

An enhanced version of the current rocket fired  from the MLRS, the extended-range (ER) rocket was expected to have a range of  45.0 kilometers or greater, compared with the fielded rocket's 31.5 kilometers. The rocket gains a longer range through a reduction of  the number of bomb  lets in the payload,  from  644 to 518, and an increase in the amount of propellant in the rocket.  In addition,  the bomblet was modified to reduce to  a rate of 1 percent the number of  hazardous duds on the battlefield. Both the current and  ER rockets deliver Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM) bomblets. The modified ER bomblet, XM85, had a  redundant fuzing  system and  a  self-destruct device. The fuzing  modifications  were not expected to affect the bomblet's lethality. The guided MLRS (GMLRS) rocket  added  a  GPS-aided  inertial  navigation  unit,  intended  to  improve accuracy and increase effective range, to the ER rocket. DPICM bomblet payload was to be reduced further, from 518 to about 440. The GMLRS has been an ATD since 1994.

Developmental  testing  of the  ER rocket  in  1998  included  a  design verification test of six rockets  to demonstrate  corrections  to  earlier problems  with  the  self-destruct  fuze.  These  firings  were  conducted  in March and April at White Sands Missile Range at short (16 km.), medium (26 km.), and long (48 km.) ranges with cold, ambient, and hot temperature conditions. A production qualification test of twenty-four low-rate initial production ER rockets  was conducted in April  and June at White Sands Missile Range  to  demonstrate  improved  accuracy  with a  new version of the ballistic algorithm.  Earlier testing had revealed a range bias  in which most rockets landed past their targets. These firings were also conducted at cold, ambient, and hot temperatures over ranges from 34 to 49 kilometers. Testing  in  the  GMLRS  program included  completion of three  flights  in the ATD program. These ATD flights were to demonstrate a guidance and control  package  capable  of achieving  a  two-mil  angular  accuracy  with inertial-only guidance, and a 10-m. circular error probable with GPS-aided inertial guidance.

The Army sought to enhance the strategic mobility of  both MLRS- and ATACMS-based deep attack weapons systems by integrating them with the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). That system, mounted on a Family  of Tactical Vehicles  five-ton  truck chassis,  was  intended to provide  lighter  early-entry  forces  with  ATACMS  and  MLRS  firepower formerly  available  only  to  heavy  forces.  The  HIMARS  system,  which

could be transported by  C-130 aircraft, required 30  percent fewer airlifts to  transport  a  battery  compared  with  the  current  tracked  M270  launcher vehicle.  Four HIMARS systems were built as part of the  fourth quarter of FY98's Rapid Force Projection Initiative ACTO. Three of  the prototypes will remain with the XVIII Airborne Corps for  extended user evaluation. Live› fire  safety certification  was successfully completed at White Sands Missile Range in the last half  of  FY 1998, with  seventy-eight MLRS rounds and two ATACMS missiles fired.

Efforts  to  enhance  the  capability  of tube  artillery  also  continued  in FY  1998.  The  155-mm  Sense-and-Destroy  Armor  (SADARM)  "smart" artillery submunition is designed to attack and kill lightly armored vehicles. Each SADARM-loaded howitzer  round  delivers  two  submunitions.  Once dispensed,  the  submunition  deploys  a  parachute-like  deceleration  device. At a  predetermined  distance  from  the  ground,  the  submunition ejects  the deceleration device and  deploys  another device  to  stabilize and rotate  the submunition.  As  the  submunition  falls  and  rotates,  it searches  the  ground with a millimeter  wave sensor (both active and passive) and an infrared sensor array.  Using  the  sensors and  detection  logic,  the submunition  is  designed to  detect  targets  protected  by  countermeasures  in a  variety of climates.  If the  sensors  detect  a  target,  the  submunition  fires  an  explosively  formed penetrator at the target.

SADARM operational,  reliability,  and  live-fire  tests  were  conducted in FY  1998.  Carried out at Fort Greely, Alaska,  in August, the operational test employed a target array composed entirely of  real vehicles and included anticipated countermeasures validated by the Defense Intelligence Agency. The test consisted of  :five missions of24 rounds each, fired at 19.4 kilometers, a likely range for combat use. The SADARM system did not get the required number of kills  for  the  test environment.  There  were  also  two  reliability tests.  Of fifteen  rounds  fired,  one  round  did  not  dispense  its  payload  of submunitions.  The reliability  was scored  as  0.44 (eleven  oftwenty-five  ), versus a requirement for 0.80. Three submunitions are to be scored when more data are available. Because of  changes in the design and production process of  the warhead liner, additional live-fire tests and evaluation warhead qualification and characterization tests were conducted in FY  1998, including two shots to assess any degradation in penetration performance resulting from the use of  sandbags as ballistic countermeasures. In addition to its use as a payload for unguided 155-nun ammunition, SADARM was also a projected payload for the  XM982 extended-range artillery projectile, which uses a  GPS and an onboard inertial navigation system to achieve range and accuracy greater than  conventional  projectiles.  The  baseline  XM982  version,  loaded  with DPICM, entered engineering  and  manufacturing  development  in January 1998. A SADARM carrier version with two submunitions was planned but not yet funded, as was a version with a unitary penetrator warhead.

Parallel  with  the  development of new  deep attack systems,  the Army was  developing  new  overmatching close  combat capabilities.  The Multi› Purpose Individual Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon (MPIM/SRAW) is  a  one-person shoulder-fired  weapon  capable  of defeating enemy  forces in  bunkers  and  light  armored  vehicles,  out  to  an  effective  range  of 500 meters.  The MPIM/SRAW  program  completed  its  risk-reduction phase  in March 1998, meeting all  requirements on schedule and within budget. The program completed its second phase, system qualification, in May 1998. The Modular Weapon System (MWS)a set of accessory rails permitting field attachment of sighting aids, ancillary weapons such as  grenade launchers, and  other  accessories  on  Ml6 rifles  and  M4  carbines  without  the  use  of toolsfinished  testing  and  achieved  materiel  release  in  FY  1998.  It  was anticipated that the  first  unit would  be equipped with the MWS in  the first quarter  of FY  1999.  A  possible  successor  to  MWS-equipped  rifles,  the objective  individual  combat  weapon  (OICW),  has  been  designed  to  fire 20-mm air-bursting munitions and more traditional 5.56-mm bullets, using an integrated sighting and  fire  control system  incorporating a  laser range fmder and an infrared imaging system. The OICW program began a two-year advanced technology demonstration in FY 1998.

The joint Army/Marine Military  Operations  in Urban Terrain ACTO was created to explore technologies in command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence; lethal and nonlethal engagement; force protection; and mobility. The full exploitation of  technologies explored is to be achieved by the development of  tactics, techniques, and procedures to use new capabilities in a series of  quat1erly experiments that began in FY 1998 and are to continue through the end of  FY 2000.

A  variety  of heavier  close  combat weapons  also  achieved  important development  milestones  during  FY  1998,  largely  as  AIDs  and ACIDs. The Line-of-Sight Anti-Tank (LOS  AT)  HMMWV-mounted  kinetic-energy antiarmor missile was initiated as a DOD-approved  ACTO in April 1998. The demonstration was intended to assess the operational value ofLOSAT to the early-entry force and to supply information useful to the future development of  a compact kinetic-energy missile that would provide similar capability to the much bulkier LOSAT.

The Advanced Tank Armament System program seeks to provide next› generation armament systems for direct fire weapons platforms, particularly the Abrams  tank.  The program focuses  on a  longer-barrel cannon for the Abrams, using 55-caliber ordnance instead of the  current 44-caliber tube, as  well  as  extended·range fire-control  systems for all  direct fire  platforms incorporating automatic target detection and tracking. FY98 efforts centered  on evaluating an  existing  German  55-caliber  120-mm  tank  gun, automatic  target  trackers,  gun  barrel  coatings,  and  an  electronic  muzzle reference sensor. Thjs program complements the Direct Fire Lethality ATD,

which began  in  FY  1998 and consists of two elements. One element is  the development of  an advanced kinetic-energy cartridge with a novel penetrator capable of defeating explosive reactive armor with a 40 percent increase in lethality over the current M829A2 round, incorporating a thruster system that improves accuracy up to 70 percent at extended ranges. The other element is the advanced drive and weapon stabilization program to investigate gearless gun elevation and turret azimuth drives and an optical fiber muzzle reference sensor.

RDTE activity in the field of  force protection largely involved chemical warning systems. The first unit was equipped with the automatic chemical agent detector/alarm  (ACADA)  in  the  last  quarter of FY  1998,  replacing the  M8A I  alarm. The  portable ACADA  also  supplemented  the  handheld Improved  Chemical Agent Monitor (ICAM) as a chemical  defense survey instrument for detecting nerve and blister agents. Delivery ofiCAMs began in September  1998  after  an  extensive  production  acceptance  test.  The ACADA and the !CAM are point detection devices, requiring direct contact with the chemical warfare agents they sense. They are complemented by a novel  standoff capability to be provided  by  the Joint Services Lightweight Standoff Chemical Agent Detector (JSLSCAD), a second-generation system that significantly improves upon the capabilities of the earlier M21  Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Alarm. A lightweight, passive, and fully automatic detection system that scans the surrounding atmosphere for chemical warfare agent  vapors,  the  JSLSCAD  was  specified  to  provide  on-the-move,  360degree coverage from a vmiety of tactical and  reconnaissance platforms at distances up to 5 kilometers. The system entered engineering manufact uring and development in Februaty 1998

## Support Services

## Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation

Army  Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR)  operating funds consist of the  field-operating  MWR  programs  and  nonappropriated-fund instrumentalities (NAFJ); the Army Recreation Machine Program (ARMP); and  the  Army  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  Fund.  Collectively,  $1 .3 billion in  appropriated funds (APF) and nonappropriated funds  (NAF) were applied to  support FY98  operating and capital requirements worldwide› $90.7 million  less than in FY  1997.  APF support, down $39 million, was lower in every base operating account except Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation. There were two major contributors to this decrease: Major commands reported $18.9 million less in Military Personnel, Army,  funds compared with FY I  997; in addition, noM  ilitary Construction, Army (M  CA), projects were approved for MWR this year.  For FY  1997,  in contrast,  the MWR budget funded$  5.4 million in new projects. The drop in the Military I Personnel,  Army,  account may  have  resulted  from  local  confusion  as  to military reporting requirements,  which led  to  inconsistent data.  Clarifying guidance is being prepared. The MCA funding gap will close for FY 1999 because $33  million was approved for MWR projects. For the first time in five  years, direct Operation and Maintenance, Army, support for MWR and family programs failed to exceed the Army's initial funding, thus reflecting the  pressure  that  local  commanders  faced  in  FY  1998,  matching  scarce resources with priority base-operations requirements.

The decline in the value of  the Korean won and the damage inflicted on the Eighth U.S. Army's  MWR operations by severe flooding during summer's peak  business  months  contributed  greatly  to  lower  total  MWR  revenue. Army net sales were down $25.5 million, ARMP revenues were down $21.6 million,  and  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  payments were down $7. 1 million. As in previous fiscal  years, the ratio of  /\PF to total NAF support was 2: 1. Personnel costs, 53 percent of  the total, were the main expense. After operating costs were paid,  $ 126.2 million was available for capital  requirements,  such  as  major  construction,  furniture,  fixtures  and equipment, and capital purchases. This amount was $49.8 million less than in FY 1997, as a result of  the lower cash revenue generated from  operations ($34.4 million) and the lack ofMCA projects for FY 1998.

In November 1995, the Department of Defense (DOD) published fiscal standards for M  WR, requiring APF to fund  I 00 percent of  authorized costs. Methods  for  measuring  success  in  achieving  these  standards  allowed  for incidental program-related resale operations that were not authorized APF. The measurements focused  on  the relationship of  APF and NAF operating support for Category A, Mission Sustaining Programs, and Category B, Basic Community Support, all exclusive of costs of goods sold and depreciation. For Category A, the minimum standard was 85 percent APF and  15 percent NAF; for Category B, the minimum ratio was 65 percent APF to 35 percent NAF. Army MWR founded its fiscal pla1ming for the long term on matching sources of funding with APF and NAF requirements. The MWR board of directors  had  established  tracking  mechanisms to  ensure proper execution of these standards. In FY 1998, MWR was in its fourth year of  monitoring the progress in meeting these standards. MWR made steady improvements through  FY  1998,  despite  the  funding  volatility  associated  with  force restructuring.  For  Category A,  the  FY98  ratio  was 88  percent APF  to  12 percent NAF; for Category B, 61 percent APF to 39 percent NAF.

The MWR board of  directors uses many tools to monitor  MWR operating funds and evaluate the collective financial health of  the program. Two critical indicators are the amount of  cash relative to the amount of  debt in the funds, and the amount of  outstanding Army MWR funds loaned for improvements in the MWR physical plant relative to the amount of  cash held by field NAFI activities. The MWR board monitors both indicators to determine if  financial plans  are on track.  As of 30 September  1998,  the Army's collective  ratio of MWR operating  cash  to  current  field  liabilities  was  0.9: 1.0.  This  was lower than the  1.1:1.0 ratio reported in FY 1997, primarily as a result of  the economic and  severe-weather conditions experienced  in  Korea during the past year. The Army MWR funds ratio of  loans to field cash deposits was 60 percent to 40 percent, up 9  percentage points from 30 September 1997. As anticipated, these indicators reflect a  less healthy position for the collective funds  than  the  position  that  existed  in  FY  1997.  As  a  result,  spending restraints imposed by the board several years ago remain in place.

In FY 1998, the Army continued support for soldiers and their families affected  by  contingency-related  deployments.  During  Operations  JOINT ENDEAVOR,  JOINT GUARD, and  JOINT  FORGE  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the MWR  program  established  more  than  fifty service  points to provide recreational, social, and other suppo1t services. MWR operations provided services to soldiers and deployed personnel, including comprehensive daily recreational programs; weight and aerobics training; and access to physical fitness equipment, libraries, and  wide-screen  televisions.  The  AAFES sponsored a first-run  video service, provided commercial telephone access, and  furnished  food  and  retail  services  at  all  base  camps.  Armed  Forces Professional  Entertainment  supplied  actors,  comedians,  musicians,  and  a

variety of  other entertainment groups. Civilian M WR professionals deployed with soldiers to enhance quality oflife and unit readiness. Family Assistance Centers were focal in providing help, guidance, information, and referrals to family members during deployments or other contingency operations. The Army received $12 million for supporting contingency operations. Of that total, $6.8  million went directly to improving the quality of life  for soldiers in the field.  The remainder went to  family support groups, child and  youth programs, and deployment education. The  Army also provided MWR support for  soldiers  in  Southwest Asia. Troops deployed  to  Saudi Arabia received support from civilian MWR personnel  in Riyadh and Dhahran, and MWR engaged contractors to support Army forces in Kuwait.

MWR food  and  beverage  programs  showed  lowered  but  satisfactory financial performance.  Food, beverage, and  entertainment  programs› including clubs and theme-concept restaurantsgenerated revenue of  $188 million  in  FY  1998,  the third consecutive year of decline. After expenses, this  resulted  in  a  net  income  before  depreciation  (NIBD)  of $9.7  million, slightly less than in FY 1997. FY 1998 was the first year in which the MWR board of  directors set an NlBD standard for food operations. At the end of  FY 1998, installations achieved food NIBD of5.3 percent, exceeding the initial board standard of 5.0 percent. In FY 1999, the standard will increase to 6.0 percent and in FY 2000, 7.0 percent. Traditional clubs as a subset of MWR food and beverage programs generated an NIBD of$8.8 million in FY 1998 ($947,000 less than in FY 1997) on total revenues of$164.2 million. After adjusting for $782,000  in base  realignment and closure (BRAC) expenses and the $1.4 million decline in an NIBD for Korea-Area II that resulted from flood damage and the devaluation of  the won, the financial performance for FY  1998  indicated that the clubs  held  their own.  Without these losses  in the club program, the clubs would have generated an NIBD of  $1 1 million, an  increase of $400,000 over FY  1997.  Bingo produced  more than  $33.8 million in revenue and $7 million in NIBD.

Club activities have been changing, merging history and tradition with demand-driven and financially viable activities by redesigning operations to appeal to a younger, more sophisticated market. In March 1994, the MWR board of directors approved  the  in-house development of a  branded-theme program,  analogous  to  private-sector  chain  restaurants,  to  reverse  losing trends  in  club operations  while  upgrading  installation  food  and  beverage programs.  At  the  end  of FY  I  998,  there  were  twenty-one  MWR fulland quick-service  restaurants  in  operation  under  the  program,  with  thirty-six units to open by the end of  FY 2000. The Army has also established a basic ordering agreement with Orion Food Systems of  Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to make its seven manufacturer-brand quick-service food programs available to  military  installations  as  part  of the  branded-theme  food  and  beverage program. The alliance with Orion augments theAnny Community and Family

Support Center's ftve  standard branded-theme concepts to  fill  gaps  in  food service markets. FY98 total revenue for the branded-theme  program exceeded $7.2 million, with an NIBD of  more than $640,000, or nearly 9 percent. This positive NIBD exceeded  the  basic ordering agreement's standard  for food operations, despite start-up expenses of  more than $ 150,000.

Army Community Services (ACS) assists commanders in meeting the needs of soldiers, Army civilians,  retirees, and their families  by  providing support services  and  training.  The  Army  Family  Action  Plan  is  an  ACS activity that solicits  Army community opinion on local problems and possible solutions, and then conveys the resulting information to Army leaders in an effort to  secure  legislation,  policies,  programs,  and  services  that  improve conditions within Army communities. Several issues identified through the action  plan  were  resolved  in  FY  1998,  notably  improvements  in  Variable Housing Allowance computation and better education for soldiers about the Montgomery GI Bill. Another ACS activity, the Family Advocacy Program, supplied  training  in  advocacy  for  victims  of spousal  abuse  to  advocacy program managers at the major command and installation levels,  allowing these  organizations  to  provide  expanded  services  to  victims  of domestic violence. ACS also established a partnership with the Employee Relocation Council (ERC, a trade association ofbusinesses and professionals concerned with  workforce  mobility)  to provide professional development training for ACS relocation program managers, off ering them opportunities to  identify best practices, find service partners, and participate in the ERC certification program to raise ACS professional standards.

## Health and Medical Programs

Integrating distance learning into Army Medical Department (AMEDD) training  offered  the  potential  for  increased  unit  readiness,  improvement of military  occupational  specialty  qualification  and  emergency  medical technician  certification  rates,  increased  training  quality,  and  better  skill sustainment.  ln accordance with a mandate from  the  chief of staff, Army, the  commanding general,  Army  Medical  Department  Center  and  School (AMEDDC&amp;S), directed that all AMEDD courses be analyzed for distance› learning  potential as  alternatives to traditional classroom instruction. AMEDDC&amp;S  identified  approximately  35  percent  of AMEDD  courses for  funding  through the Total Army Distance Learning Program (TADLP). AMEDDC&amp;S  expected  course  modifications  funded  by  the  TADLP  in FY  1998  to  reduce  costs  by  reducing  resident  course  lengths.  With  the incorporation of  distance-learning teclmiques, the resident course length for 91B I  0  (medical  specialist)  reclassified  training would  be shortened  by  50 percent, and  the  length for  91B30 (basic noncommissioned officer course) technical  training  would  be  shortened  by  40  percent;  the  resident  option

for  91B40  (advanced noncommissioned  officer course) training would  be eliminated  in  favor  of distance  learning.  Other  AMEDDC&amp;S  distance› learning efforts included online training in information management, as well as development of interactive courseware for training in combat lifesaving, blood shipment, and preparation of  medical profiles.

The U.S.  Army  Center for  Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM)  completed  an interim exposure assessment and risk characterization  for the DOD Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses  (OSAGWI)  concerning  soldiers' possible  exposure  to  depleted uranium  (DU)  during  Operation  DESERT  STORM.  The  USACHPPM  used existing  DU  test  documents,  pertinent  data,  and  assumptions  regarding DU exposure  to  produce  an  initial  exposure  assessment  and  health  risk characterization  for  the  OSAGWI's Level  I exposure scenarios (in  which a  single  M829  120-mm DU  round,  in  a  fratricide  incident,  penetrated  the crew compartment of  an M l A  1 heavy armor tank). Level I individuals-that is, crew members and first responders, excluding those  with  DU  fragment injurieswere estimated to receive committed effective dose equivalents of less  than  0.5  rem  (roentgen equivalent man)  in  15  minutes' exposure. For comparison, the federal limit for occupational radiation exposure is 5.0 rem per year.

Congress directs the DOD to manage several appropriations for targeted research grant programs. Since FY 1992, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), as executive agent, has administered targeted appropriations for research on prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and neurofibromatosis. (After the National Cancer Institute, the DOD is  the second-largest funder of breast cancer research in the United States.) The  USAMRMC's Congressionally Directed Medical  Research  Programs Office manages  these  programs.  Tn  FY  1998,  Congress  appropriated  $40 million for the prostate cancer research program, $10 million for the ovarian cancer  research  program,  $138.5  million  for  the  breast  cancer  research program, and $9.8 million for the neurofibromatosis research program.

Another area of  extensive congressionally mandated research is telemedicine,  the application  of  advanced  sensor  and  communication technologies  to  the  diagnosis  and  treatment of disease.  The USAMRMC oversaw and  funded  a  number of private-sector telemedicine  programs  in FY 1998. The Cooperative Teleradiology Project at the University of  South Florida  College  of Medicine's Moffit Cancer Center  in  Tampa  supported research into digital radiology. The Portable Digital X-Ray Project conducted by the General Electric Center for Research and Development sought to adapt digital X-ray teclmology for  immediate military use, including providing a feasibility prototype for military evaluation. The Volume AngioCAT Project at  MultiDimensional  Imaging  in  Newport Beach, California, explored the potential for early detection of  a wide spectrum of  diseases. The Ultrasound

Imaging  Initiative  Project  at the  Cleveland  Clinic  in Cleveland,  Ohio, intended to provide accurate medical imaging and diagnosis at an aid station or remote field hospital.

Advanced  imaging  techniques  imply  an  enhanced  ability  to  conduct minimally invasive medical procedures. An initiative funded  at the Center for  Minimally  Invasive Technology of Massachusetts  General Hospital  in Boston would create a national program to generate and develop innovative and important concepts in minimally invasive  therapy,  and  to  do the work needed to  make such experimental procedures practical  for routine usc  by practitioners.  The  Periscopic  Minimally  Invasive  Surgery  Project  of the Georgetown Medical Center in Washington, D.C., aimed to improve the state of  the att in image-guided,  minimally invasive spine surgery by developing a  new  generation  of clinical  techniques  along  with  the  computer-based software  and  hardware  needed  for  their  implementation.  The  Computer› Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery Project of  the Cleveland Clinic sought to  improve the  practice of surgery through  sophisticated  computer-based tools.

The USAMRMC supported a number of  projects in a further application of  telemedicineimproved emergency medical servicesin FY 1998. The Advanced Trauma Care Project located at the Illinois Institute ofTechnology, Chicago, supported  the development and  prototyping of technology to aid diagnosis  and  treatment  in  trauma  situations  and  disaster-relief  efforts, including  chemical  and biological  emergencies.  The  Life  Support  for Trauma and Transit Program, contracted to Northrop Grumman Corporation, was  researching  advanced  life  support and  transport systems that rapidly diagnose,  treat, and evacuate casualties in  highly  dispersed  mobile forces. The Emergency  Telemedicine Project  at  Mercy Health System, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, would develop, test, and validate an emergency telemedicine system. Funding for the National Medical Technology Testbed supported a cooperative research agreement with the Loma Linda University Medical Center  in  Loma  Linda,  California,  to  promote the application of defense and aerospace technology to  health care delivery. The Defense Healthcare Information  Assurance  Program  at  the  South  Carolina- based  Advanced Technology  Institute  addressed  security  aspects  of  telemedical  service delivery.

For  efficient  response  to  possible  animal-health  disasters,  the  Army Veterinary Command (VETCOM) maintains clear communications with the DOD, the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of  Pathology, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the U.S.  Department of  Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S.  Public Health Service. In the event of  an outbreak of a foreign animal disease, the VETCOM would provide assistance in line with a memorandum of understanding between  the  DOD,  the  General Services Administration, and  the  USDA.  The  command's initial  aid  could  be  an  animal-disease

diagnostician to help con  firm the existence of  a disease or  a defense veterinary support officer to assist other agencies.

The  VETCOM  established  its  five Special  Medical  Augmentation Response  Teams-Veterinary  (SMART-Vs)  in  FY  1998  as  an  additional emergency force.  In the case of  escalation of  a disease outbreak, a SMART› y might  deploy  to  function  as  a  veterinary  field  investigation  unit or as part  of an  animal-disease  eradication  organization.  SMART-Vs  respond to  disasters  or foreign  animal-disease outbreaks  in cooperation with local, state, and federal authorities or  as required by the National Federal Response Plan.  Each team consists of  six veterinary services personnel.  In the event of  a major disaster, the most available team would deploy to assist local and state responders. The SMART-Y mission consists primarily of  assessing the need  for additional veterinary support and providing for smooth integration of  such suppott when it is required. The VET  COM plans for teams to deploy within twelve hours of  notification.

The Army Dental Corps has used a variety of  Army programs to increase both accession and retention of  dentists in response to a projected shortage. The AMEDD 's  Health  Professions Scholarship Program (I-IPSP) pays a dental student's  educational expenses and provides a stipend for living expenses, as it  does  for  students  in  other  health professions. The  dental  student  incurs an eight-year obligation,  including active and reserve service. The active› duty potion of  the obligation varies from three to four years, depending on the number of  years of funding the student receives.  Funding for 318 man› years would result in 79- 80 graduates per year by 2001, approximately 80 percent of  required Dental Corps accessions. The program sustains funding at this  level  thmugh FY 2005. Twenty-six Dental Corps accessions  in FY 1998 were I-IPSP recipients, with fifty HPSP seniors scheduled to graduate in June 1999. The Army projected the number of  graduates to reach seventy› eight by FY 2001, eighty in each  of the  following  three  fiscal  years,  and seventy-eight again  in  FY 2005.  Surplus HPSP money  made  possible the establishment of  the Health Professions Loan Repayment Program (HPLRP) in FY 1998. The program pays $22,000 per year for up to four years of  dental school to each FIPLRP dentist's institution. As  in  the HPSP,  the active-duty obligation  associated with the HPLRP varies  according to  the  number of years  of payment.  In the HPLRP's first  year,  five  dental  officers  recruited in the  summer of 1998  received twenty man-years of funding  at $22,000 per year.  Under the  Dental Accession Bonus program, eligible individuals receive  $30,000 grants upon  initial  obligation  to  the Army  Dental Corps. The Dental Accession Bonus program has been funded for FY 1997 through FY 2002. It carries an active-duty service obligation of four years. Twenty› four  out of thirty-six eligible accessions in  FY  1998 (67 percent) chose to accept the dental-officer recruiting bonus. The Army offers graduating senior dental  students  the  Advanced  Program  in General  Dentistry,  1-Year,  upon

commissioning in the Army  Dental Corps. In FY  1998, the Dental  Corps offered the program to thirty-two dental officers.

The  Army  is  addressing  dentist  retention through  another  set  of programs, awarding dental additional special pay, variable special pay, and board certification pay to eligible dental officers,  commensurate with rank and period of  commissioned Dental Corps service. Pay in all three categories increased under both the FY97 and FY98 Defense Authorization Bills. The FY98  Defense  Authorization  Bill  authorized  a  Dental  Officer  Multiyear Retention Bonus for dental specialists who agreed to remain on active duty two to four years beyond any existing service obligation. In FY 1998, each of the  armed  services  offered  this  bonus  only  to  oral  and  maxillofacial surgeons. For FY 1999 (and programmed until FY 2005), the other services will  offer the bonus to  other dental specialists,  but the Army  continues to fund  only oral  and  maxillofacial surgeons. Thirty out of fifty-five  eligible oral  and maxillofacial surgeons (55  percent) accepted the retention bonus, with twenty-five of those thirty (83  percent) signing a  four-year contract. Dental officers in all ranks and promotion year groups enjoyed an increase in incentive pay. The combination of  accession and retention efforts improved a projected Army Dental Corps end strength of 984 to  an actual  FY98 end strength of 1,015.

## Army Chaplaincy

As  Chaplain  Corps  strength  has  risen  to  pre-1991 levels  and Army commitments worldwide have increased, the Army chaplaincy has continued to  evolve.  In  FY  1998,  the  Office  of the  Chief of Chaplains  (OCCH) published  a  new  edition  of AR  165-1, Chaplain Activities  in  the  United States Army; two  new Department of the Army pamphlets, DA  Pamphlets 165-17, Chaplain  Personnel  Management, and  165-3, Chaplain  Training Strategy; and  a  new  Armed  Forces  hymnal.  Along  with  these  doctrinal and  administrative  publications,  the  OCCH  published  volume  7  of the Chaplain Corps  history, Encouraging Faith,  Serving Soldiers: A  History ofthe U.S. Army Chaplaincy, 1975- 1995, written by Chaplain (Col.) John W.  Brinsfield,  Jr.  The OCCH significantly enhanced  logistical support to the Chaplain Corps through  its  Information, Resource Management, and Logistics (IRML) Directorate, fielding the Muslim extender kit and the lay leader extender kit as supplements to the basic chaplains'  supplies for faith groups that historically do not have religious support in most contingencies. The IRML Directorate also made chaplain kits more available.

The  U.S.  Army  Chaplain  Center  and  School  (USACHCS)  at  Fort Jackson,  South  Carolina,  revamped  its  training  and  doctrinal  services to  reflect  changes  in  demand.  The  USACHCS  reorganized  the  Training Directorate from three divisions to five: operations, training development,

officer  training,  enlisted  tramwg,  and  functional.  The  chaplain  officer basic course became more battle-focused. The chaplain officer advanced course  became the chaplain career course-the twenty-one-week course requiring a  permanent change of station  was  replaced  by  eight weeks of temporary duty followed by Combined Arms Staff  Support School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The division and installation courses began training simultaneously,  based  on  the  Lieutenant  Colonel/Colonel  Critical  Task List.  In addition,  the USACIICS realigned Advanced  Individual Training increasing training time from 268 to 290 hours, with a shift of  emphasis from administrative to religious support. The USACHCS Combat Development Directorate  oversaw  the  integration  of combat  development  with  the Combat Training Centers, placement of  combat development instructors at the Unit Ministry Team training conference and on the Senior and Reserve Advisory  Councils,  and  the  formal  integration  of the  chaplaincy  into Division advanced warfighting experiments.

## Army Pay

Title  37,  U.S. Code,  section  1009,  directs  that  monthly  basic  pay of servicemembers be  adjusted  upward,  based  on the  General  Schedule (GS) federal  employees' pay  increase calculated  in  accordance with  the permanent  statutory  GS  pay  raise  formula,  regardless  of whether  later statutes modify  the  actual  GS  raise  paid  in  any  particular year.  The pay increase  for  servicemembers, however,  is  not  identical to  the  percentage increase  in GS  pay.  Army  pay  raises  derive  from  the  increase  in  the Employment Cost Index  (ECI)  calculated  by  the Department of Labor's Bureau of  Labor Statistics. The ECI measures annual percentage increases in wages  for all  private-sector employees,  although  it  can  be  subdivided to measure increases in specific categories of  such employees. The actual percentage  increase in GS pay is  not the percentage increase in  the ECI over the period described; the applicable statute, Title 5, U.S. Code, section 5303(a), provides that the overall  increase  in  federal  GS  pay  will  be 0.5 percent  Jess  than  the  percentage  increase  in  the  ECI.  In  FY  1998,  the statutory  formula  yielded  a  2.8  percent  increase.  The  president's budget included this increase, which went on to become part of  the final budget in the FY98 National Defense Authorization Acl.

## Army Housing

Barracks were the Army's number-one facilities priority in  FY 1998. A  tri-service  survey  in 1992  had  shown  a  strong  correlation  between the quality of barracks life and soldiers' morale and intent to  reenlist.  In February 1994, the chief  of  staff, Army, accordingly approved new barracks

designs that incorporated the "one-plus-one" accommodation standard as part of  the Whole Barracks Renewal Program. This standard, later adopted DOD-wide, prescribed  one  soldier per room  with  an  area  of 11  square meters,  with two  rooms sharing  a  bath  and service area.  Since adopting the one-plus-one standard,  the Army has embarked on an aggressive and fully  funded program to  modernize  barracks  for permanent-party single soldiers at all installations. In FY 1998, the Army funded new or renovated barracks for  more than twelve thousand soldiers. All  newly  renovated or constructed barracks are to be equipped with new furnishings.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

During FY 1998, Army and Air Force Exchange Service payments made to  the Army declined. The FY98 payment to  the Army was $137 million, whereas the FY97 payment had been $145 million. The primary reason for the decrease, which was  mainly in the Class VI (personal demand items) dividend, was the economic condition in Korea caused by the devaluation of the won.  The .1\.AFES  also  instituted some operational changes  in  FY 1998.  The  Marine  Corps  and  the  Naval  Exchange  Service  Command chose the AAFES to be the combined service credit provider. The goal of this  program is to  substitute exchange credit cards for bankcards,  which had cost the AAFES  $22- $25  million  per year in fees.  Additionally,  the AAFES instituted shopping online and merged its sales and merchandising directorates.

## Command Information

In the spring of 1998, on behalf  of  the Army, the Office of  the Chief  of Public Affairs (OCPA), submitted a Silver Anvil nomination to the Public Relations  Society  of America's annual  competition  for  the  best  public relations  efforts  of 1997.  The  OCPA  entered  "Digging  Out  after a  Sex Scandal," which  traced the Army's recovery  from the sexual misconduct cases at Aberdeen Proving Ground and other posts. This entry won in the Crisis Communications category. Whereas the other fourteen Silver Anvil categories  separate  competition  by  genre  (such  as  academic,  industry, government, and charity), the Crisis Communications category is open to all genres, with only one Silver Anvil awarded.

The Public Affairs and Communications Media (PACM) career program for civilian public affairs employees continued in FY 1998 to upgrade training and to better employ a civilian force declining in numbers to cope with more numerous  Army operational  missions. The PJ\CM annual planning  board addressed the continuing issues of  restoring life insurance coverage, income tax exclusion, and leave carryover as well  as  limited overtime benefits for

civilians  volunteering to  deploy to  hazardous areas. The  Department of the Army petitioned the DOD for relief  on behalf  of  the OCPA, but the Office of Management and Budget rejected the request.

Under the PACM program, the OCPA also continued to rely on enhanced training  to  raise  quality  in  order to  offset quantitative  losses.  The  OCPA discovered that fifty-six GS-9 civilians were in journeyman positions without having  taken  the  public affairs  officer  basic  course  at  the  Department of Defense Information School, Fort Meade,  Maryland.  In many cases, local commanders had placed outside personnel who were facing reductions into public affairs  positions. The chief of public affairs  elected to  use his own civilian  training  funds  to  send  as  many  of these  untrained  public  affairs officers  as possible  to  the Fort Meade school.  Eventually, sixteen attended the course under OCPA sponsorship, with four other officers'  training funded by their own commands. This was the first time that public affairs civilians attended  the  public  affairs  officer  course at the  expense of Headquarters, Department of  the Army, rather than at the expense of  field commands.

Soldiers  Radio and  Television (SRTV) produced a variety ofprogratruning in  FY  1998.  The  new Army Healthwatch newscast,  a  thirty-minute  show on  health,  fitness,  and  preventive  medicine  topics,  went  out to  forty-five continental U.S. medical treatment facilities for use in patient waiting rooms. In addition, SRTV distributed Army Hea/thwatch with its Army Newswatch program, enabling access by cable affiliates and post command information activities. The Army pub! ic affairs medical editor produced twenty-six video news  releases  as  well  as  fifty-two  radio  news  releases  and  promotional announcements during the year. Two thirty-minute Washington Reports were produced: One assisted the U.S. Army Physical Fitness School in informing soldiers about changes in the A1·my physical fitness test; the other, produced for  the  Office  of the  Surgeon  General,  explained  the  anthrax  vaccine immunization program. Other SRTV programming added this year included Contact, a five-minute segment dealing with the problems of  everyday life; Do Yourse((a Flavor, sixty seconds of nutritional advice; Profile America, a  daily  program  featuring  facts  and  figures  from  around  the  country;  and The Car Show, a daily two-minute program on car care featuring nationally known automotive maintenance expetts.

The Public  Affairs Proponent  Activity (PAPA) develops doctrine, training programs,  and  materiel,  and  provides  organizational  and  soldier  support for Army  public affairs activities.  In  FY  1998,  the PAPA  supplied  public affairs training material based on new doctrine to support Land Information Warfare Activity courses for Army staff, commanders, and unit leaders. The PAPA  reviewed  and  provided  input  for  the  Information  Operations Total Requirements Analysis  Program  portion of WarSIM 2000,  the developing battle-simulation  modeling  program.  The  analysis  program  will  provide for  media  and  public  affairs  presence  in  future  simulations.  The  Public

Affairs Proponent Activity also produced and fielded two digitized training support packages:  "Implement a  Public Affairs Plan  (Media Facilitation)" and "Participate in a Media Interview." These were the first training courses provided to align public affairs training across the Army.

The PAPA developed new mission training plans in FY 1998 for public affairs  operations  center,  public  affairs  detachment,  and  mobile  public afTairs  detachment  Table  of  Organization  and  Equipment  (TOE)  units, replacing  1990 products. Mission training plans  identify and elaborate on critical wartime missions  in detailed training and evaluation outlines. They also provide exercises and other training through training management aids, which assist commanders in planning and executing unit training. In support of the Army's Change in  Noncommissioned Officer Structure initiative, the PAPA standardized all public affairs assets in active- and reserve-component TOEs, increased public affairs positions in new Theater  Army Area Command and Theater Support Command TOEs, eliminated discrepancies in divisional public  affairs  assets,  started  new  grade tables  for  all  public  affairs  (CMF [career management field] 46) soldiers, and designed a new CMF 46 career map.  In addition,  the PAPA  began a  manpower requirements criteria study that is scheduled for completion in FY 1999.

Army Public Affairs hosted a series of regional media trips  to  Bosnia. In  1998,  more  than  seventy  positive  stories  about  soldiers  in  Operation JOINT FORGE resulted from the seven nine-day media trips sponsored by Army Public Affairs.  Media markets included Dothan, Alabama; Colorado Springs,  Colorado;  Houston, Texas;  the state of New Jersey;  Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah;  San Antonio, Texas;  St.  Louis, Missouri; and  western Massachusetts;  and  Salt Lake  City,  Utah.  On each  trip  four media members and an Army escort traveled via Air Force planes to Bosnia, where the Coalition Press Information Center matched media members with hometown soldiers.

## Army Tuition Assistance Program

All soldiersofficers, warrant officers, and enlistedon active duty, and Army National Guard and Army Reserve soldiers on active duty pursuant to Title  10  or Title 32, U.S.  Code, are authorized  to participate in the  tuition assistance  program. In  FY  1998,  the  tuition  assistance  policy  guaranteed every eligible soldier fifteen semester-hours per year (generally considered the equivalent of one semester's full course load) at three-fourths of tuition costs up to $60 per semester-hour for freshman- or sophomore-level courses, $85  per  semester-hour  for  junioror senior-level  courses,  and  $170  per semester-hour for graduate-level courses. Tuition caps for soldiers stationed outside the continental  United States were governed by  rates negotiated in tri-service contracts.  Using  local  funds,  commanders  had  the  authority  to

augment local tuition assistance funds beyond the Department of  the Army fifteen-semester-hour  standard.  The  tuition  assistance  funding  limit  for noncredit courses not denominated in semester-hours was $1,300 per fiscal year. Soldiers were required to have an approved, documented degree plan or Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges Army Degree student agreement to receive tuition assistance beyond the nine-semester-hour level. In April 1998, the Army implemented an "upfront" Army tuition assistance policy that allowed soldiers to receive seventy-five percent of the cost of tuition for distance-learning courses at the time of  enrollment. In the past, soldiers were reimbursed after successful completion of  distance-learning courses. To qualify for upfronl tuition assistance, soldiers are required to enroll in regionally or nationally accredited courses that are no  more than twenty› four  weeks  long.  Soldiers  must  also  complete  funded  courses  before leaving  the  installation  where  course  enrollments  occurred.  The change from reimbursement to upfront funding assists soldiers financially and thus eases access to distance-learning courses.

## Anny Sports Program

FY 1998 was generally a successful year for Army sports teams. The U.S. Army Sports Program won twelve of  the twenty-two contested Armed Forces  championships  in  1998.  The  Army  boxing  team  won  its  ninth consecutive Armed Forces championship by winning ten of twelve bouts. The wrestling team took three gold medals, one bronze, and one fifth-place finish  in  the  USA  University  Nationals,  and regained  its  Armed Forces overall championship title. The women's basketball team won its seventh consecutive Armed Forces championship and placed six members on the Armed Forces team. The men's  and women's  bowling teams placed second, behind the Air Force. The men's and women's taekwondo team won  the Armed Forces fight-off by winning seven of  the eight contested qualifying events. The women's volleyball team placed second, behind the Air Force team, and the men's team placed third, behind the Navy and Air Force. The men's and women's track-and-field  teams  won  their seventh consecutive Armed Forces  track-and-field  championship. The  men  captured  twenty› three of forty-seven medals; the women captured eighteen of thirty-eight medals.

The  men's  racquetball team  won five of  nine individual  medals, including first-place finishes  in  all three of the age divisions; the women took three of the six  individual  medals (one gold,  one silver,  and one bronze). The triathlon team placed second at the Armed Forces championship, behind the Navy. The men's  and women's  softball teams finished second at the Armed Forces championships, both behind the Air Force. The golf team took third place  honors  at  the  Armed  Forces  championships,  behind  the Air Force

and Navy in  first and second places, respectively. The men's  soccer team placed fourth. The Army team won the tennis championship by  beating the Navy, with the Air Force placing third. The men's basketball team won the Armed Forces championship as well as the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers  Europe Tournament  in  Germany.  The  modern  pentathlon  team placed sixth at the Conseil International du Sport Militaire championships in  Rome, Italy. Eleven soldiers represented the Army on the Armed Forces team-handball team, which won the national title at the USA Team Handball tournament in Atlanta, Georgia. The Armed Forces marathon team ran in the 22nd Marine Corps Marathon, and the Army contingent placed third, behind the Air Force and the Navy.

## Construction, Facilities,  and Real Property

Congress  appropriated  $706,477,000  in  FY  1998  for the Military Construction, Army,  program. The Army requested  projects totaling $595 million, but  Congress added $162  million. The president  vetoed congressional additions  totaling  $75.8  million,  which  affected  all  projects  not  related to  quality  of life  and  readiness. The  vetoed  projects  were  restored  on 25 February  1998,  with  MCA  monies  distributed  as  follows:  environmental compliance, $7.4 million; Army Strategic Mobility Program, $91.4 million; Whole Barracks Renewal  Program,  $367.1  million;  leadership  initiatives, $20.0 million; critical mission, $14.6 million; revitalization, $140.9 million; unspecified  minor MCA programs, $7.4 million; and planning and design, and host-nation support, $65.6 million.  Revised economic assumptions led to a deduction of  $7.9 million, for $706.5 million.

In FY 1998, there was continued funding in support of  the Whole Barracks Renewal Program, with $248 million appropriated for facilities in the continental United States, $76.1 million for facilities in Korea, and $43 million for facilities in Europe. Congress added four projects, totaling $29.3 million. Funding continued for  facilities in  support of the  Army  Strategic  Mobility  Program,  including the  second  phase  of the  Army's pre-positioned  equipment  mission  overseas in  Southwest Asia.  Facilities  to  house  the  new close  combat  tactical  trainer systems at Fort Carson, Colorado, and Fort Riley, Kansas, were also funded. Congress  funded  the revitalization of the Army's infrastructure at $140.9 million by adding  16 projects totaling $116.4 million. Projects included the first phase of  the Missile Software Engineering Annex at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; the first phase of  the Force XXI Soldier Development Center, Fort Hood, Texas; the first phase of  a military operations on urban terrain training facility at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; fire stations at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey,  and  Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri; a chapel at Fort Story, Virginia; two projects at Fort Drum, New York;  and an  ammunition demilitarization support project at Pine Bluff  Arsenal.

Section  2906(  d)  of the  Defense  Base  Realignment  and  Closure  Act of 1990  provided  for  a  special  Treasury  account  to  receive  the  proceeds collected from the disposal or transfer of  real property or facilities acquired, constructed,  or  improved  (in  whole  or in  part)  with  NAF.  By the  end  of FY  1998, the Army Base Realignment and Closure Office had transferred approximately $7.4 million to the special account for the reimbursement of the depreciated values ofNAF investments in real property at Army BRAC installations.  The remainder of  the NAF investment at BRAC installations yet to be disposed of  was approximately $27.8 million. The NAP losses totaled approximately $3.2 million as a direct result of  no-cost conveyances.

The Army  initiated  a  more  aggressive  Facilities  Reduction  Program (FRP)  in  FY  1998.  Having  disposed  of 47  million  square  feet  (msf)  of excess space since the beginning of FY 1992 (largely through demolition), at the  beginning of FY  1998, the  Army still held  approximately  104  msf, an amount that roughly equaled  the  combined  building square  footage  of Forts Benning,  Bliss, Bragg, Hood, Knox, Polk, and Sill.  In FY  1998, the Army funded the FRP at $104 million. Disposals recorded by the end of  the fiscal year totaled 10.7 msf, with disposal of  an estimated additional3.6 msf under contract but carried over to FY 1999; an additional3.0 msf  previously declared excess was returned  to  use. At the end  of FY 1998,  the  Army's estimated  excess  space  was  86.7  msf.  The  FRP  has  already  reduced  the real property management funding requirement by $400 million. The Army programmed $100 million per fiscal year for FY 2000 through FY 2003 to dispose  of an  additional  35.0  msf of excess  space.  State-owned  National Guard facilities  and facilities  supported  by Ammunition, Working  Capital Fund, or DOD funds are not included in the FRP because of  their source of funding.

Since  1991, the Army has had a program to privatize installation utility systems. The program focuses on the 265 systems serving sixty-seven major installations  in  the continental United States.  On  1 May  1997, the chief of staff, Army, informed the commanders of  major commands that owning and operating utility  systems were  not  military  core  f· unctions  and that utility services could be obtained from local public and private utility companies at best value. As part of  the Defense Reform Initiatives (ORis), two directives› DRID 9 and DRID 49, issued on 10 December 1997 and 23 December 1998, respectivelyrequired  the  military  departments  to  privatize  installation utility  systems,  except where  it  would  be  uneconomical  or where  unique security reasons prevented it. DRID 49 reset the DRID 9 goal for completing all  utility  privatization  from  1 January  2000  to  30  September 2003. Title I 0, U.S.  Code, section 2688, authorized the armed services to transfer these systems  to  a  municipal,  district,  regional,  cooperative,  or  private  utility company,  and  required  competition  where  feasible  and  recovery  of fair market value for the system. To meet the DRID timelines and the legislative

mandates,  the  Army  developed  strategies  to  streamline  the  procurement process, maximize marketability of  the hundreds of  utility systems subject to privatization, and capitalize on the economics of  scale and buying power of the DOD.  In  1998, the Army started a partnership with the Defense Energy Support Center to enhance contracting power by bundling multiple systems across major  commands and military services within a geographic region into single acquisitions, rather than into a series of  smaller discrete acquisitions.

## Special Functions

## Environmental Protection

In  FY  1998,  the  Army  environmental  cleanup  program  completed its transition  to  decentralized  execution,  with  major  commands  having responsibility for all program  planning, budgeting, and  execution  of remediation activities at operating  installations.  Headquarters, Department of the Army, and  the Army Environmental Center had previously managed these functions centrally.

By  the  end  of that  fiscal  year,  10,204  potentially  contaminated  sites remained  at 1,076  active  installations.  The  Army  has  determined  that 7,961 of  these sites require no further action, except long-term monitoring. Remedial  activities are planned or under way at the  other 2,243 sites. The Army  has  completed  construction  of environmental  remediesremoval, containment, or on-site treatment of contaminationat 844 sites. Sixty-six of these  sites  require  remedial  action  operations:  Remedies  are  in  place, but  cleanup  objectives  have  not yet  been  achieved.  In  addition  to  these permanent remedies, the Army has  completed  967  interim actions at 629 sites at active  installations.  The 405  sites  that  had  been undergoing  study or cleanup in FY 1998 were determined  to  require no further action.  Eight installations,  excluding U.S.  Army  Reserve Centers,  achieved  "remedy in place"  or "response  complete"  status  (that  is,  remedies  constructed  and remedial  action  operations  were  under  way  or complete,  respectively)  at all sites. The Army continued to refine its cost estimates for cleaning up  its hazardous waste sites.  Examination of  cleanup assumptions and validation of data  from  ongoing cleanup sites  in  FY  1998  revealed a total  projected completion  cost  of $7.9  billion:  $6.5  billion  for  installation  restoration at active  installations  and  $ 1.4  billion  for  installation  restoration  at  base realignment  and  closure  (BRAC)  installations,  $1.2  billion  less  than  the FY97 estimate.

In FY 1998, the Army greatly improved access to the data systems used to  manage  restoration  activities  at  its  installations.  Historically,  ensuring that  Army  installations,  major  commands,  and  headquarters  all  shared the  same  data  has  been  a  challenge.  To  address  this  problem,  the  Army moved  its  data  collection  system  onto  the  World  Wide  Web.  The Army also  integrated  the  BRAC  cleanup  plan  abstracts  into  this  system  so  that

planning and data collection  for active and  BRAC installations resided on the same system.  During the past year,  the Army supported  the  initiatives of  the Federal Remediation Technologies Roundtable (FRTR), a cooperative effort of  federal agencies  on  environmental  restoration  requirements sponsored  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency's (EPA's) Technology Innovation Office. In FY  1998, the U.S.  Army Environmental Center made Web-accessible  the  FRTR-developed  Restoration  Technologies  Screening Matrix  and  Guide,  which  provides  guidance  on  identifying and  selecting decontamination  technologies.  The  Army  Corps  of Engineers  Center  of Expertise for Hazardous and Toxic Waste developed the homepage, as well as links for the FRTR Web site.

Remedial  activities  were  in  progress  at  most  of the  112  installations being closed  and  at  the 27  installations  being  rea ligned  under  the  BRAC 19~8, 1991,  1993, and  1995 rounds. By the end ofFY 1998, the Army hnd identified  1,944 potentially contaminated sites at 117 BRAC  installations. Of  these sites, 1,032 required no further action, except long-term monitoring. Remedial activities were planned or under way at the remaining 912 sites. During the fiscal year, the Army completed construction of final remedies at 278 sites,  12 of which required remedial action  operations. In FY  1998, studies  followed  by  cleanups  were  completed  at  134  BRAC  sites,  and these  sites  required  no  further  action.  Thirty-nine  BRAC  cleanup  teams, including representatives from  the Army,  local governments, and the EPA, had been formed to expedite cleanup activities at installations where there was excess property.  In FY 1998, the Army completed all  environmental› baseline surveys for installations affected by the  1995 BRAC round. These surveys document physical conditions at the component properties of  each installation in order to identify possible environmental concerns.

Acting as executive agent for the secretary of  defense, the Army continues to  develop  a  Department  of Defense  (DOD)  firing-range  rule  covering responses for unexploded ordnance and other constituents of munitions at ranges subject to the BRAC process. During FY 1998, the  Army received and summarized approximately 250 pages of  public comments on the proposed range rule published in the Federal Register on 26 September 1997. As of  the end of  the fiscal year, the DOD expected to revise the range rule in response to  these comments and to make the rule final  by the sunu11er of2000.

In FY 1998, the Army expanded its independent technical review (ITR) program, which  had  begun as a pilot program at four BRAC installations in  FY  1997. Each ITR involves a one- to two-week review of the technical, administrative, and managerial aspects of an installation's cleanup program by  a  panel  of Army  and  non-Army  experts.  Advice  emerging  from  the reviews ranged from specific remedies for individual cleanup sites to ideas on how to negotiate with regulators and local communities on controversial issues. Findings and recommendations arising from ITRs would not be final

until  acceptance by  the regulatory agencies and receipt of information and advice ti·om the local community. In FY 1998, the Army conducted reviews at  ten  more  BRAC  installations  and  established  the  ITR  program  at  two active installations. The BRAC  ITR program produced savings  at several installationsmost prominently at Savanna Army Depot Activity,  lllinois. There,  the  ITR recommended  no further  action  at an old  burning ground on  a  small  island  in  the  Mississippi  River.  A  removal  action  with  a  life› cycle cost of  approximately $68 million,  including FY99  and  FYOO  costs of approximately $25  million,  had  been planned  at the site.  Based on the minimal evidence of  unacceptable risk to  human health or the environment, the ITR determined this action to be unnecessary. The BRAC installations reviewed  through the  program were  together responsible for a $39  million reduction  in  BRAC  work-plan  requirements  for  FY  1999  and  FY  2000, representing a thirty-to-one return on investment. As of  the end of  FY  1998, the Army planned to conduct ITRs at twelve BRAC installations and eight active installations in FY  1999.

The  Army  benefited from partnerships with regulators  and local communities  in  reassessing  planned  groundwater  treatment  systems.  At Twin  Cities  Army  Ammunition  Plant,  New  Brighton,  Minnesota,  several years  of  effo11  culminated in the signing of the installation-wide record  of decision,  the  last environn1ental-remedy  decision  for  the installation. The Army also recovered $3.9 million from the insurance company covering this government-owned,  contractor-operated  facility.  These  funds  will  be  used for  future  cost-recovery efforts within the Army's cleanup program. In FY I  998, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, completed construction at all remediation projects. The Army formally petitioned the EPA to delete Schofield Barracks from the  National Priorities List (NPL, the "Superfund" list of  urgent cleanup targets). At Fort Dix, New Jersey, the Army worked closely with EPA Region 2  and state regulators  to  obtain agreement on  designating the  NPL-listed landfill "construction complete." In FY  1999, the Army will seek to  delete this installation from the NPL.

The Army also initiated an effort to optimize use of  resources dedicated to operating and maintaining groundwater treatment systems. In  FY  1998, the Army operated major groundwater pump-and-treat systems at thirty-five installations, with annual system operating costs totaling approximately $25 million.  These  systems  extract  contaminated  groundwater through  wells, treat  it,  and  then  discharge  the  treated  water into surface waterways.  The average construction cost for each pump-and-treat system was approximately $3  million;  the  systems  have  a  design  life  of at  least  thirty  years.  In  FY 1998, the Army began reassessing its most expensive groundwater-treatment systems to identify cases possibly warranting system improvements, closure, or substitution of alternative  technologies.  Any  modifications  would  have to  establish  or  meet  treatment  objectives,  protect  human  health  and  the

environment,  reduce  long-term  operations and  maintenance requirements, and maximize the cost effectiveness of  the remedy. It was believed that some existing pump-and-treat systems could be  replaced with less costly in  situ systems (eliminating the need for pumping) or supplemented through proven natural-attenuation  processes.  At  Hunter  Army  Airfield  in  Georgia,  the Army planned to recommend implementing a monitored natural-attenuation remedy (that is, keeping the site under surveillance as pollutants decay) as part  of an  initiative  to  reassess  planned  groundwater-treatment  systems. If  accepted by  the environmental regulators and the  local community, this recommendation could result in savings of $5  million. A separate study of existing and proposed groundwater-remediation systems at Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant, California, resulted in a 40 percent reduction in operating costs and in annual savings of  $1.2 million. The Army has begun to reassess plans for almost seventy additional pump-and-treat systems.

In FY  1998, the Army held outreach meetings in five  of the  ten  EPA regions. These forums brought together Army  major  command  and headquarters  managers  and  the  region's  EPA  and  state  enviromnental regulators.  The  meetings  covered  program  goals,  budgeting,  community involvement, innovative technologies, case studies, and regulatory issues.  The Army hoped to have outreach meetings in the other five EPA regions in FY 1999. Partnerships with regulators and the community in FY 1998 produced substantial benefits  for  the Army's program.  At  Fort Wainwright,  Alaska, for example, excellent relationships with regulators and coordination on the revision of  the final operable uni t's  record of  decision resulted in an expedited review  of this  document.  At  the  Tobyhatma  Army  Depot,  Pennsylvania, successful  partnerships with the EPA  and state regulators  resulted  in  one closeout document for thirty-five sites requiring no  further actions instead of the two documents originally planned.  Partnership  initiatives with EPA Region 4  and the Alabama Department of Enviromnental  Management at Redstone Arsenal  improved  document-review  time  and  resulted  in  more effective decision making.

The Army has continued to work with local communities, sharing cleanup program information  and receiving information regarding project priority, sequence of  project implementation, and funding allocation. The Army has learned that restoration advisory  boards (RABs) can be effective tools for obtaining this community insight and advice.  By the end of FY  1998, the Army had  established  sixty-four  RABs. The Army  evaluated  community interest in  establishing RABs at additional installations to ensure that it could fully  benefit from community  involvement in its cleanup program.

At BRAC installations,  the J\.rmy  worked  with local communities and reuse  authorities  to  transfer propetty. In  FY  1998,  the  Army  initiated  the deletion from the NPL of  a 37-acre parcel at the Army Research Laboratory in Watertown, Massachusetts. The deletion would greatly enhance the value

of the property transferred. The local reuse authority agreed to maintain the land-use controls implemented as part of  the remedy at the installation. Land› use controls  also enabled  the Army  to  transfer a  parcel  with groundwater contamination at Letterkenny Army Depot, Pennsylvania. Local communities had been concerned about whether the controls would be maintained when the Army no longer occupied the BRAC installation. To allay these concerns, the Army issued an interim policy addressing how land-use controls would be  documented and  maintained after transfer of the  property. This policy established a benclu11ark for similar DOD activities.

The Army Corps of  Engineers was involved in a variety of interagency water-resources  partnerships  in  FY  1998.  The  Flood  Plain  Management Services  Program allowed  the  Corps  of Engineers  to  help  states,  Native 1\merican tribes, and local governments develop plans and initiate actions to mitigate flood  losses.  FY98  funds  were used  to  increase technical  services to  Native Americans  and  to  give  special  emphasis  to  assisting  federally recognized  tribes  with  flood  plain  management planning  on their  lands. Responses to requests  from communities, tribes, and individuals for flood› related information, interpretation, and  guidance  numbered  forty-eight thousand during FY 1998 and involved property valued at $5.5 billion. The Section 22, or Planning Assistance to States, program helps state and ttibe planners  prepare comprehensive plans for conservation, development, and use of  water. Under this program, the Corps of  Engineers provides technical assistance  and planning  guidance  for  a full range  of  water-resources problems, including wetland identification, environmental restoration, water supply, water quality, and flood-damage reduction. The cost of  the program is shared evenly with non  federal sponsors. In FY 1998, the program matched $3,397,000  in  nonfederal  funds.  Ninety-four  studies  were  performed  for thirty-seven states,  as  well  as  ten  studies for  Native American tribes. The Clean Water Action Plan  initiative  focuses  public and  private attention on improving water quality and restoring watershed health.  Federal agencies, together  with  states,  tribes,  and  local  partners,  are  implementing  more than  one  hundred  action  items.  Accomplishments  for  FY  1998  included the development of watershed assessments and restoration strategies in  all fifty  states  and on some tribal  lands.  The Corps' involvement in  the Clean Water Action Plan National Steering Committee and in  the field provided a mechanism for technical assistance and for identifying potential projects to further restoration goals developed at state and local levels. The Corps also provided technical and policy advice to interagency partners, working with other agencies to develop and recommend new strategies to address state, tribal, and local needs.

The American Heritage Rivers Initiative (AHRI) is another partnership of the Corps of Engineers with other agencies. Executive Order 13061  ( ll September 1997) directed implementation of this initiative and created the

AHRI fnteragency Committee comprising the heads of twelve departments and agencies, including the DOD, for which the Corps of Engineers served as  executive agent. The  AHRI focuses  on developing long-term  goals  and innovative  solutions  to clean  up  rivers,  to rejuvenate  the· communities and areas that surround the rivers,  and to stimulate economic growth  and sustainable development in those communities. As of the end of FY  1998, there are  fourteen  designated American  Heritage Rivers.  Each river  has  a river navigator whose role  is  to  bring federal  governmental services to  the local level. The Corps of Engineers provided navigators for the New River, which runs through North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia, and for the upper Mississippi  River  from  its  headwaters  to  the Missouri  River.  Each of these navigators would  work with the river partnerships to  develop and implement work plans reflecting the river communities' and states' desires and goals  for  restoration, preservation,  and economic  revitalization of the rivers and their related resources.

The Corps of  Engineers developed several other interagency environmental partnerships during FY 1998. The Corps and the Department of the Interior began to explore cooperative means for restoring abandoned mine sites on federal lands. The collaboration progressed with the acid mine drainage programs and the Appalachian  Clean Streams  Initiative,  both of which demonstrated  the Corps' commitment to environmental restoration. The Corps of Engineers and the EPA sustained a pat1nership for economic recovery of"brownfield" (polluted) sites and began to explore the possibility of  applying Corps planning and technical assistance in the study of  potential reuse  of Supedund  sites  before  remediation  decisions  are  made.  The Corps continued  its  involvement in the Coastal America  initiatives  at the national, regional, and local levels, developing and implementing numerous environmental restoration projects.

The  Army National Guard (ARNG)  environmental plan focuses on four major areas: compliance, restoration, pollution prevention, and  conservation.  During  FY  1998,  the  ARNG's compliance  program concentrated  on  reducing  release  of pollutants  through  source  reduction, recycling,  treatment, and disposal. The Guard reduced by  340 the  number of underground storage tanks not meeting the pending standard of Subtitle I  of the  Resource,  Conservation,  and  Recovery  Act  of 1976.  New  EPA regulations implementing Subtitle I specify that, by 22 December 1998, all underground petroleum and hazardous substance underground storage tank systems installed before 22 December 1988 must meet certain requirements for  protection  against  spills,  overfilling,  and  corrosion.  The  ARNG  also managed projects to upgrade vehicle wash racks at 25 facilities, to construct hazardous waste storage facilities at 43  locations, to construct portable or fixed spill containment structures and devices at 253 locations, and to install oil- water separators at 44 locations. These efforts reduced by  16 percent the

open notices of EPA regulatory violations at ARNG facilities, and reduced new notices of violation  by  36 percent over FY  1997. The ARNG's FY98 environmental  program also included enhanced compliance with the Clean Air Act. The ARNG evaluated strategies to implement its part of the Clean Air Act inspection and maintenance program to ensure that all government› and privately owned vehicles being operated on  federal installations complied with local vehicle emissions requirements. In FY 1998, the ARNG entered into a partnership with the active component to expand the capabilities of  its Windows Compliance Assessment and Sustainment Software. This software provides  an  automated  method  for  installation  commanders  to  identify compliance  problems, develop  corrective  action  plans  and cost estimates, conduct root-cause  and  trend  analyses, and track  progress. The Army has adopted this software as its official environmental assessment tool.

The  ARNG  evaluated  sites  for  past  contamination  and  conducted cleanup  operations  where  necessary.  In  FY 1998,  the  ARNG  expended more than $36 million in Environmental Restoration, Army, funds and more than $4.4 million in operation and  maintenance  funds.  The cleanup at the Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod was  the ARNG's largest cleanup  project,  with  FY98  Environmental  Restoration,  Army,  funding of more  than  $29  million.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the  ARNG  Restoration Program  completed  fourteen  preliminary  assessments  to  determine  the potential  for contamination sources and eight site inspections to determine the actual presence of  contamination. Ongoing projects in FY 1998 included four preliminary  assessments, four  site inspections,  fourteen remedial investigations, and twenty-two remedial actions. In addition, the state ARNG environmental  offices  had  restoration  actions  either  ongoing  or  proposed at 223  state-owned sites. The state environmental offices  were responsible for  tracking  and  executing the ARNG restoration  program  at state-owned facilities.

The ARNG completed $5.4 million in pollution-prevention projects in FY 1998. These projects included pollution-prevention plans and opportunity assessments,  along  with  the  purchase  of antipollution equipment,  such as aqueous-based  parts  washers,  to  reduce  the  need  for  hazardous  solvents, antifreeze recyclers, and oil filter crushers. Through these efforts, the ARNG continued to exceed DOD goals for reduced generation of hazardous waste. During FY 1998, two  environmental  impact statements  (for Multipurpose Range Complex-Heavy [Camp Shelby, Mississippi)  and  the Multipurpose Training Range [Camp Atterbury, Indiana]) were completed with published records of decision.  In  addition,  the ARNG completed  two  programmatic environmental  assessments  documenting  the environmental impact  of fie lding  the  Paladin  self-propelled  howitzer system  to  nine states. Twenty› six environmental assessments were completed during FY 1998, supporting fourteen construction projects, eight equipment fieldings, and  four training

exercises.  ln August  I 998,  soldiers  of the  1st  Battalion,  297th  Infantry (Scout),  Alaska ARNG,  tested  5.56-mm "green" ammunition,  featuring  a bullet  with  a  tungsten-tin  core  considered  environmentally  safer than  the usual  lead  alloy.  Such ammunition would  therefore allow  ARNG units  to train in Alaska's  environmentally sensitive locations.

Major ARNG  conservation  projects  completed  in  FY  1998  included 24 statewide pest management plans, wetland inventories covering 250,000 acres on ten installations, and eight integrated natural resource management plans.  Inventories of archaeological and historic properties were completed in  all  fifty-four  states  and  territories.  Nine  states  with  training  sites  that participated  in  the  forestry,  grazing, and agricultural  outleasing programs received reimbursements totaling $1 .2 million.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The  Army  small  business  program  exceeded  the  goals  assigned  by the  DOD  for prime contracts awarded to  small and small  disadvantaged businesses. Of the  Army's  total  procurement  funds (more  than  $7.4 billion), 28.1  percent was awarded to small businesses in FY 1998. Small disadvantaged  businesses  received  $2.5  billion,  or 9.5  percent  of total Army procurement expenditure.  Additionally,  historically  black colleges and universities and other minority institutions received $24.0 million  in contracts. The Army  also surpassed  all  previous  records  set for  awards to women-owned  small  businesses,  awarding  them approximately  $860 million, or 3.2 percent of  total contract awards. Of  $3.3 billion in FY 1998 Army funds subcontracted by prime contractors, $1.9 billion was awarded to  small  businesses  under  the  Small  Business  Subcontracting  Program. Small disadvantaged businesses received $297 million, and women-owned small  business  firms  received  $218  million.  For comparison, of the  $2.5 billion subcontracted by Army prime contractors, $1.7 billion was awarded to small businesses in FY 1997. Of  that amount, $260 million was awarded to small disadvantaged businesses, and $211 million went to women-owned small businesses.

One initiative  that has contributed to  the success of the Army's small business subcontracting program is the DOD pilot Mentor- Protege Program, in  which  the Army is  a  major participant. This program encourages  DOD prime contractors (mentors) to develop the technical and business capabilities of small  disadvantaged  businesses  and  other  eligible  proteges,  enabling the  proteges  to  expand  their  business  base  within the DOD  marketplace. The firms  represented in the Mentor-Protege Program encompass a broad range  of industries,  including  environmental  remediation,  manufacturing, telecommunications, and health care. So far, the Army has approved thirty› three mentor- protege agreements as part of  the DOD program.

A unique aspect of  the Army mentor- protege program is the 8(a) Graduate Pilot  Mentor-Protege  Program,  "8(a)"  referring  to  a  section  of the  Small Business Act promoting the development of  small disadvantaged businesses. This  "pilot  within  a  pilot" program  gets  firms  that  have  graduated  from the Small  Business  Administration's 8(a)  program  involved  in  mentoring emerging 8(a)  firms.  The Army has been granted a  waiver to  allow up  to ten 8(a) graduates who are Army contractors but who do not have an active subcontracting  plan  to  participate.  The  Army  has  already  approved  six mentor- protege agreements  under this new initiative,  ranking first among the armed services in total percentage of  procurement funds awarded in the program.

## Legal Affairs

During  FY  1998,  there  were  685  completed  trials  by  general  courts› martial, 273  by special courts-martial empowered to  impose a bad conduct discharge, and 14 by ordinary special courts-martial. In addition, there were 489 trials  by summary courts-martial.  Overall, the  FY  1998 court-martial rate  was  2.0 I  per thousand soldiers, down from  2.24 per thousand  in FY 1997. The number of  nonjudicial punishments imposed during this same time totaled 41,447, for a rate of  85.60 per thousand soldiers, up from 82.21  per thousand in FY 1997. During FY 1998, the clerk of  court for the U.S. Army Court of  Criminal Appeals received 771 new cases for appellate review. The court decided 783 cases for all of  FY 1998.

The Army keeps its military justice procedures up-to-date through  its representation on  the Joint Service  Committee on  Military Justice (JSC). The JSC completed its fourteenth annual review of the Manual for Courts› Martial in FY 1998. This review was published in the Federal Register for public comment, and a public meeting was held to receive comments from interested parties. The JSC  proposed rules for  the  issue of a  new category of protective  orders  preventing  the  pa1ties  and  witnesses  from  making out-of-court  statements when  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  of material prejudice to a fair trial. The committee offered clarification to the manual's language concerning which convictions are admissible on sentencing. The National Defense Authorization  Act for  FY  1998  amended the  Universal Code of  Military Justice to aut]. )rize courts-martial to impose a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole for any offense previously carrying a  punishment of  confinement for life. The JSC proposed changes to the existing rules, discussion, and punitive articles referring to sentences of  confinement for life to include the new sentencing option. The committee also proposed updating all model specifications  by  removing references to the  twentieth  century  from  dates  of offenses.  In  addition to  reviewing  the Manual  for  Courts-Martial,  the  JSC  recommended  legislation  amending

Article  111  of the Universal Code of  Military Justice to provide a  blood or breath alcohol concentration of0.08 grams or  more per 100 milliliters ofblood or 210 liters of  breath as a per se standard of illegal intoxication for drunken operation of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft. The committee also completed its review of the new DOD policy prohibiting hazing, recommending that the DOD implement the policy by service directive rather than by changes to the Manual for Courts-Martial  or the Universal  Code of Militaty Justice. The DOD general counsel endorsed that recommendation and forwarded it to the individual services.

The Army had more than thirteen hundred active cases involving general and  tort  litigation  in  FY  1998.  This represented  a  slight decrease  in  total cases  following several years of significant increases.  Despite the  military drawdown,  the  tort-litigation  branch  of the  Office  of the  Judge Advocate General maintained a caseload of more than 500 open cases. By the end of FY 1998,  the Army's procurement-fraud caseload was approximately 650 active cases, with the inOux  of new cases remaining relatively steady. Qui tam cases, those brought by individuals on behalf of  the United States, were approximately one-tenth of  total cases. During the year, civil, criminal, and administrative  recoveries,  including judgments entered  but  under appeal, exceeded $167 million.

During  FY  1998,  the  Army  suspended  48  and  debarred  121 poorly performing,  fraudulent,  or unethical  contractors. The  rate  of suspensions and  debarments has  remained  consistent over  the  past three  fiscal  years. Contractors  suspended  or  debarred  by  the  Army  are  excluded  from  all procurement and nonprocurement activities throughout the executive branch. When suspension or debarment is not essential to protect the government's interests, the Army may enter into an administrative settlement agreement, which allows contractors  to  continue  to  do  business with  the government while providing assurances that the  contractor will  conduct itself with the highest  degree  of  integrity.  These  agreements  require  contractors  who have  demonstrated  a  lack  of business  integrity  or honesty  to  implement an  extensive ethics  program. The Army  usually  requires  the  appointment of an  independent ombudsman  to  help  the Army monitor the contractor's compliance.  In  FY  1998,  the  Army  was  monitoring  67  contractors  for compliance with administrative settlement agreements.

The rate of  Army-related appeals filed with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals declined slightly, from 174 new case filings in FY 1997 to 153 in FY 1998. The funds involved remained substantial, however, with the 236 active cases representing $408 million. One case in particular, an appeal filed by Defense Systems Company, involved a $72 million claim against the government for alleged deficiencies in the technical data package it provided for the company's production of the Hydra 70 rocket. Although the number of appeals arising in  Europe appeared to be disproportionately high (31  of

236 total  active  appeals),  nearly  half of them  related  to  contracts  induced by  fraud  rather  than  other  forms  of contract  dispute.  Based  on  a  recent decision by  the Armed  Services  Board of Contract Appeals that contracts induced by fraud are inherently void, the Army anticipated dismissal ofthese cases,  thereby significantly decreasing the number of acUve appeals on the European docket.

Army  attorneys  assisted  the  Army  leadership  in  developing  a  new fraternization policy. This work furthers implementation of  the secretary of defense's directive  prohibiting personal or economic relationships between officers and enlisted personnel. Behavior prohibited by  the policy includes dating,  sharing of Jiving  accommodations, engaging in intimate or sexual relations, conducting joint business enterprises, making commercial solicitations,  gambling,  and  borrowing.  The  new  policy  would  not affect existing marriages.

Operational law  issues persisted  in  Bosnia  in  FY  1998. Army  lawyers worked  with the  DOD and  the State Department on agreements  covering Stabilization  Forces  (SFOR)  activities  tluoughout Bosnia  and  Croatia,  on legal issues arising  from  continued enforcement of the military provisions of the  Dayton  Peace Accords  of 1995,  and  on efforts  to  provide a  secure environment for implementation of the civil aspects of the accords.  Since June  1998,  when the  1st  Cavalry  Division assumed responsibility  for  the Task  Force  EAGLE  mission,  diplomatic  and  legal  considerations  have predominated in decisions on the use of  military force from tactical through strategic  levels.  As  a  result,  Task  Force  EAGLE  judge  advocates  have joined an information operations working group along with the civil affairs, psychological  operations,  and  public  affairs  personnel  usually  associated with  information operations. The Task Force EAGLE legal office solidified its  role in  the  information  operations  working group when judge-advocate legal analysis of  an SFOR-dirccted weapons seizure operation conducted in response to treaty noncompliance provided clearly articulated arguments that became the basis for an information operation. The information disseminated persuaded the local populace and key decision makers to accept the actions of the  peace operations force.  Because of the success of this operation, the lawyers'  role in peace operations expanded.

Increasing  usc  of mediationand  arbitration-based  alternate  dispute resolution methods had a substantial impact on the Army equal-employment› oppottunity  complaint  system  in  FY  1998.  The  number  of precomplaint contacts made by Army civilians for alleged discrimination based on race, color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  or disability  increased  by  more than 250, whereas the  number of subsequent formal  complaints decreased by  more  than I  00. Within  the  higher  number  of precomplaint  contacts, the  proportion  of those  in  which  alternate  dispute  resolution  was  applied more than doubled, which led  in turn to  reduction in the number of  formal

complaints filed.  Army attorneys worked with  specialists at Headquat1ers, Department of the Army,  and the  DOD to  develop an Army-wide, civilian and military alternate dispute resolution program.

The  Army  Claims  Service  and  more  than  one  hundred  field  claims offices pay soldiers and other govenm1ent personnel for loss and damage of personal property incurred  incident to service.  During FY  1998, the Army paid $39.2 million to settle 57,366 such personnel claims. The FY98 figures represented $3.4 million less in compensation and 2,963  fewer claims than in FY 1997. The downward trend in personnel claims, which resulted from the reduction of forces,  is  expected to  level out as  the Army  end strength stabilizes. When  claims  are  related to  transportation of  personal properly, the  Army Claims Service aggressively pursues recovery  from  the carriers responsible  for the  loss and  damage; funds  recovered arc  reinvested to pay future claims.  In FY 1998, Army claims personnel recovered $ 19.4 million from carriers, an increase of  $800,000 over FY 1997.

The Army's Affirmative Claims Program has been extremely successful in recovering  the  costs of medical care,  lost  wages,  and property damage incurred as a  result of the negligence of third parties. In FY  1998, claims offices  recovered $11.8  mill ion  in  medical care claims  from  third  parties, $8.0  million of which  was  reinvested  directly  in  the military  hospitals  in which the injured soldiers were treated. In FY 1998, claims offices collected more than $70,000  in lost wages from negligent third parties, all of which was returned directly to  the injured soldiers'  units. Claims offices recovered $2.2 million for the cost of  military property damaged by  the negligence of third parties, $1.6 million of  which was returned directly to the installations where the damage occurred.

In FY 1998,  the Army Claims Service and field  claims offices settled 6,594 tort claims worldwide for $3 1.9  million, a decline of approximately $10 million from  FY  1997. These payments included  personal injury and death claims,  as  well as property damage,  environmental, and operational claims. The Army  Claims  Service pays environmental damage claims  for military facilities overseas that have been closed and returned to host-nation authorities. A  number  of the 670  European military  sites either closed  or scheduled to close have the  potential to  generate significant environmental damage claims against  the  Army. The  Army Corps of  Engineers has estimated U.S. liability for these sites to be in excess of$500 million. The  Army Claims Service paid $ 12 million for environmental damage claims in Europe in FY 1998.

Military  personnel  of the  2d  Infantry  Division  and  other  U.S.  Army elements suffered  great  personal  property  damage  in early  August  1  998, when  the  northern  pa1t  of the  Republic  of Korea  experienced  its  worst flooding  in forty  years.  Within  twenty-four  hours,  the U.S. Armed  Forces Claims Service-Kore~ dispatched a team of  three claims investigators to the

most heavily damaged areas. The Claims Service then posted its personnel to the affected areas to support the local Judge Advocate General Corps (JAGC) offices.  Within  forty-eight  hours  of the  initial  flooding,  JAGC  personnel were paying on-the-spot cash  advances to  U.S.  soldiers.  During  the  next few  weeks, JAGC personnel adjudicated  J, 165  claims and paid  in excess of $1. 1 million  to  deserving  military  claimants.  In  spite  of the  difficult conditions, the average time from claim to payment was only seven days.

## Inspector General Activities

The  mission  of the  inspector general  and  the  U.S.  Army  Inspector General  Agency is to inquire into the state of  discipline, efficiency, economy, morale, training, and readiness throughout the Army. During FY 1998, the Inspector  General  Agency  Assistance  Division  handled  I  ,854  Inspector General Action  Requests  (IGARs),  compared  with  2,383  !GARs  in  FY 1997. Of  the 1,854 requests, I,  181  (64 percent) were requests for assistance and  673  (36  percent)  were  allegations.  Of the  673  allegations,  148  (22 percent) were substantiated, 477 (71 percent) were nonsubstantiated, and 48 (7 percent) were neither substantiated nor nonsubstantiated. Referral from the  DOD Hotline  accounted  for  501  Army  I  GARs.  DOD whist1eblower I  GARs decreased to a total of  forty-four for FY 1998, compared with one hundred requests in FY 1997. The I  GARs received in FY 1998 came from a  variety of sources:  16 requests were presidential (a significant decrease from 64  in  FY 1997), 89 congressional (down from  130 in FY 1997), and 49  from  senior Army and DOD leadership  (down  from  85 in FY  1997). The active component accounted for 631  (34 percent) of  the complainants. There were 131  (7  percent) reserve-component complainants and 366 (20 percent)  civilian  complainants;  the  affiliation  of 726  complainants,  39 percent of  the total number of I  GARs, was unknown.

Six  functional  categories  accounted  for  80 percent  of the  IGARs  in FY  1998.  Personal  conduct,  which  includes  sexual  harassment,  racial discrimination, and nonsupport, was the cause for 528 requests, 28 percent of  the  total. Command/management  of organizations,  a  category  that includes care  for  soldiers and  family  members, storage and  shipment of property,  and exercise of  command  influence,  led to 385  requests, or 21 percent  of FY98  IGARs.  Personnel  management- military,  a  category that includes recruiting  operations,  reassignments,  evaluation  reports, promotions, separations,  awards, and  decorations, accounted  for  242,  or 13 percent, of  total action requests. Personnel management- civilian, which includes  management- employee  relations,  recruitment  and  placement, and promotions and awards, Jed  to  154, or 8 percent, of the total  number of FY98  TGARs.  Finance  and  accounting,  involving  military  base  pay, allowances, retiree pay, travel  pay, and nonsupport assistance, gave rise to

J  09 action requests, or  6 percent of  the total. Acquisition, including policies and procedures, contract administration and surveillance, and competition, accounted for 73 requests, or 4 percent of  FY98 I  GARs.

In  FY  1998,  the  Inspector  General  Agency's  Inspections  Division conducted  numerous  planned  inspections  to  address  a  broad  spectrum of force-readiness  and  resource-management  issues.  The  division  also performed assessments of issues that prompted the immediate concern of the Army Secretariat and the  Army Staff.Amongthedivision's  high-visibility inspections  and  assessments  were  the  Task  Force  on  Extremist Activity: Defending American Values, Phase II (reserve component and Department of  the Army civilians); and a follow-up assessment of  the U.S. Army School of the Americas, done in response to  a  DOD  inspector general evaluation report.  Other inspections and  assessments completed or in  progress in FY 1998 concerned weapons and munitions security and accountability,  basic combat training  and  one-station unit training,  the  government  travel card program, high-intensity  training,  the  Combat Training  Centers,  the  Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Army Career and Alumni Program, the Voting Assistance Program, and armed forces recreation centers.

The Technical  Inspections Division conducted  numerous compliance› oriented inspections of  Army organizations with nuclear- or  chemical-surety missions during FY 1998. The division inspected the surety compliance of8 chemical-agent storage sites, 3 chemical-agent demilitarization facilities,  6 civilian contract chemical-defense laboratories, 1  chemical-defense research laboratory, the Army Technical Escort Unit, the Defense Ammunition Center, the  Chemical  Decontamination Training  Facility,  and  the  Army  Materiel Command headquatters. The Teclmical Inspections Division also conducted a  special  inspection  of  command-and-control structures at Army chemical storage and demilitarization sites.

The Intelligence Oversight Division focused on its mission of  inspecting sensitive activities, especially special-access programs, and military intelligence activities. Inspections examined fmancial, contract, security, and acquisition  management;  compliance  with Army Regulation 381-10, U.S. Army Intelligence Activities; and the secretary of  the Army's  related areas of interest:  financial  management, property accountability,  usc of  government credit card programs, and control of  communications resources.  At the request of the deputy chief of  staff for intelligence, the division maintained its role of  assisting in the assessment of  compliance with procedures governing the control of foreign  liaison officers. In response to the Army general counsel' s request,  the  division continued  to  spot-check military  intelligence support to law enforcement (especially drug enforcement operations) in conjunction with scheduled intelligence oversight inspections. The division assisted the Army's  sensitive-activities review, resulting in the identification and planned inspection  of additir"1al  sensitive  activities  within  the  Army.  Finally,  the

Intelligence  Oversight  Division  worked  to  improve  the  Army's declared material weakness in training for oversight of  intelligence activities.

The  Investigations  Division  investigated  allegations  of  misconduct against general  officers,  senior  executive  service  civilian  employees,  and other  officials  in  high-visibility  positions.  During  FY  1998,  the  division received  726  allegations  and  completed  7  6  formal  investigations and  120 preliminary inquiries. Of  the allegations formally investigated, approximately 8  percent were substantiated,  with abuse of authority  being the  allegation most frequently received.

## The Army and Arms Control

The Army plays a key role in the nation's  arms-control effort. The service provides  policy  analysis  and  recommends  positions  on  all  Presidential Review  Directives on nonproliferation,  ballistic missile defense,  chemical and  biological  arms  control,  and  export  controls.  The  Army  serves  as the  DOD  executive  agent  for  implementation  of the  Chemical  Weapons Convention,  and  it  plays  a  major  role  in  implementing  the  Conventional Forces  in  Europe  Treaty.  The  Army  participates  in  cooperative  threat› reduction  efforts  undertaken  by  the  United  States  and  the  nations  of the former Soviet Union. The Army Staff reviews arms-control  strategies and analyzes U.S.  government positions in many negotiating forums,  including the Organization for Security and Cooperation  in  Europe, the Open Skies Consultative Commission, the Organization for the Prohibition of  Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Biological Weapons Convention Ad Hoc Group, the Conference on Disarmament, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty Standing Consultative Commission.

In  FY  1998,  the  U.S.  Army  was  fully  engaged  in  implementing  the Chemical  Weapons  Convention:  destroying  former  chemical  weapons production facilities  and providing support for  inspections and visits at all declared Army facilities. The project manager for the disposal of  chemical stockpiles supervised the destruction of  96,707 munitions, containing more than 1,373 metric tons of  chemical agents, from the active inventory. These destruction  operations  (conducted  at  the  Jolmston  Atoll  Chemical  Agent Disposal  System;  the  Tooele  Chemical  Agent  Disposal  Facility;  and  the Chemical Agent  Munitions Disposal System [CAMDS] at Oquirrh Mountain, Utah) were verified by the continuous presence of  inspection teams from the OPCW.

The project manager for non-stockpile chemical materiel (PM-NSCM) oversaw  the  destruction  of obsolete  and  withdrawn  chemical  munitions, chemical-agent  test  kits,  former  chemical  weapons  production  buildings, and  other  items  outside  the  active  chemical  weapons  inventory.  OPCW inspection  teams  verified  the  destruction of 195,648  M987  binary  nerve-

agent projectiles at  Hawthorne  Army Depot, Nevada; 408 Chemical Weapons Convention Category 3 (riot-agent) weapons at Pine Bluff  Chemical Activity, Arkansas; and II ,368  Category 3  chemical weapons at the CAMDS. The Army also facilitated initial visits by the OPCW in preparation for planned destruction  operations  at  Dugway  Proving  Ground,  Utah,  using  the  PM› NSCM Munitions Management Device-1 and at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, using the prototype Detonation Test and Destruction Facility.

The  PM-NSCM  was  also  responsible  for  destruction of all  declared chemical weapon  production  facilities, including their buildings and equipment.  In  1998,  6  buildings at Aberdeen  Proving Ground, I building at  the production facility  for VX  nerve agent in Newport,  Indiana, and 33 pieces of  equipment  from the Marquardt chemical weapon production facility at Pine Bluff, Arkansas,  were destroyed.  OPCW inspection  teams verified all of these  destruction operations.  In  anticipation of future  destruction of chemical  weapon production  facilities,  detailed  destruction  plans  for  the mustard gas production  facility  at Rocky Mountain Arsenal  in  Commerce City, Colorado, and the Pine Bluff  production facility for BZ incapacitating agent were  submitted  to  the OPCW The Army  further supported OPCW inspections  of all  declared  chemical  weapons  storage,  chemical  weapon production,  and  Schedule  1  (chemical  warfare  agent)  facilities  in  1998, which included inspection of 13 storage facilities at 10 Army installations, 19 inspections of  chemical weapon production facilities at 4 Army installations and  l  conh·actor location (Swannanoa, North Carolina), and 2  inspections of Schedule  1 facilities  at 2 Army installations. The Army Depot Activity commanders and their staffs facilitated all of  these inspections.

The  Corps  of  Engineers  has  conducted  several  projects  with  the governments of the former Soviet Union, as part of  the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which seeks  to  control and reduce the  former-Soviet inventory of weapons  of mass  destruction.  At  the  request of the  Defense Special  Weapons  Agency,  the  Cold  Regions  Research  and  Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was provided $1.9 million to develop an information analysis  system  for mitigating  the  consequences  of  potential  nuclear accidents in support of  the Russian Ministry of  Defense. On 17 March 1998, the CRREL began fielding the system in Russia. The system provides data› processing, geographic information systems, and communication equipment to  assist  Russian  Ministry  of Defense  perso011el  responding  to  nuclear accidents. The system includes both computer hardware and software. The project, including on-site training in vibro-acoustic analysis and geographic information systems, has been completed.

The Corps of  Engineers also has been assisting the Russian government in designing  and building  the  Russian Fissile  Material  Storage Facility at Mayak.  Russia  and  the  United  States jointly  fund  the  project,  which  the Russians designed wi!h  U.S.  assistance. The $742.6 million facility will  be

able to store fissile material removed from  12,500 warheads in fifty thousand special containers  manufactured in the United States and placed in vertical tubes  encased  in  concrete.  The  storage  building,  planned  to  be  safe  and secure,  will  be 215  feet  long and  204  feet  wide,  with a  roof 25  feet  thick and outer walls 22 feet thick and 52 feet high. Through FY  1997, Congress had committed $165 million for design, construction, and equipment. FY98 funding  may  not  be  released  until  April  1999; Congress  is  first  seeking a signed agreement between  the DOD  and  the  Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation addressing the total U.S. funding contribution for this project.

By the end of FY  1998, design of the  Fissile Material Storage Facility was  85  percent complete  and  construction was  35  percent complete. The Corps  of Engineers  Transatlantic  Programs  Center,  Winchester,  Virginia, awarded a  design  and construction contract to Bechtel National  in March 1996  to  implement  U.S.  assistance.  The  majority  of the  American  effort centered on construction of the  main storage building and eleven  support buildings, together with procurement of  specialized U.S. equipment. Bechtel has  subcontracted  with  the  Russians  for  design  and  construction.  Work continues on the main storage building's exterior walls and roof, the interior walls in the receiving area, and the support structures for the fissi le material nests.  In April  1998, the Russians determined that they would not be able to fund their remaining share of  the project. This resulted in the United States agreeing to pay for completion of only  phase I (total U.S.  and Russian cost of$513 million) and agreeing to provide another $129 million to bring the total U.S.  contribution to  $412.6 million. Two additional years  were  added to the project's  duration to allow the United States to obtain funding for the additional requirement. At the end ofFY 1998, the completion of  this 25,344container main storage facility (phase I) was thus expected by February 2002. A  decision  to  construct phase II,  which  would  roughly double the storage capacity, was expected by 2000. If  constructed, completion of  phase II would be expected by July 2006, at a cost of  approximately $229.6 million.

The Corps of  Engineers also has been assisting the Russian government in chemical weapons disposal projects. The $693 million chemical weapons destruction facility (CWDF) in Shchuch'ye,  Russia, will neutralize chemical nerve  agents,  the  predominant  type  of chemical  agent  in  Russia. U.S. technology  for  chemical  agent  destruction  involves  incineration,  but  the Russians rejected incineration for environmental and political reasons in favor of a  two-step neutralization- bituminization processthat is,  conversion of the agents to a chemically inactive substance in a pitch-like matrix. The U.S. Army Engineering and Suppott Center at Huntsville, Alabama, awarded an engineering  management support contract for the CWDF on 5 December 1996 to R.  M. Parsons, Inc. The project site selection was made on 11  July 1998. At the close ofFY 1998, the facility design was 33 percent complete.

The process was slowed by  the site selection efforts and by Russian delays in providing  ammunition  specifications  (length,  width,  metal  thickness, and other parameters) needed to design the automated line for drilling into and draining  the  contents  from  the  chemical  munitions.  In  addition,  U.S. and  Russian  scientists recently completed development of a  procedure  to neutralize the nerve agents on an industrial scale. A completion date of  June 2006 has been established for construction of  the CWDF.

The  $34.5-million  Central  Analytical  Laboratory  (CAL)  project,  in Moscow, involves renovation of  an existing facility previously used to create nerve agents. The CAL will analyze samples, be responsible for developing analytical  and  monitoring  procedures  at  chemical  agent  destruction  and storage facilities, assist with training of  personnel at destruction and storage sites,  and  serve  as  a  quality  control  center for environmental  monitoring during storage and destruction. On 16 October 1996, the Corps of  Engineers awarded to Contrack International, Inc., a contract to design and build the CAL. The contractor completed the design by January  1998. As of the end of  FY 1998, the renovation was 8 percent complete.

## Support to Civilian Agencies

The Army responded to more than twenty-five requests for support from civilian authorities by providing more than 2,100 active-component soldiers and Army civilians, along with 18,450 members of  the reserve component. The  Headquarters,  Department of the Army, director of military support (DOMS) coordinated Army and joint support for these emergencies and special events. In the aftermath of  Hurricanes Bonnie, Charley, Danielle, Georges, and Mitch, the  Army took part in relief  efforts in Central America, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and the continental United States. The Army provided the most extensive domestic support following Hurricane Georges,  which  caused  considerable  damage  in  the  Gulf  Coast  states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. That relief  effort involved 8,300 Army personnel. The Army also assisted relief efforts during northeastern U.S. ice storms in  January 1998, with about 4,600 soldiers and civilians taking part. Earlier in the fiscal year, 650 Army personnel engaged in relief  efforts after Typhoon Paka struck Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.

Throughout  FY  1998,  the  Army  provided  Domestic  Preparedness Program (DPP)  training  to  cities  across  the  country.  The  DPP,  created to comply with the  1996  Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Act, prepares U.S. cities to respond following catastrophic incidents caused by WMD. The secretary of defense designated the secretary of the Army as executive agent  for  the DPP;  the assistant secretary of defense for special  operations  and  low-intensity  conflict  gained  responsibility for  DOD  WMD  d0mestic  preparedness  policy  matters,  and  exercised

oversight of the DPP budget. The DOMS served as the staff action agent, and  the  commander of the  Soldier and  Biological  Chemical  Command was the program director. The DPP provided  for Army support of initial training  visits  to  each  participant  city,  and  a  train-the-trainer  session focused  on each  city's first  responders:  hazardous  material,  firefighting, law enforcement, and emergency medical service personnel. Tabletop and practical  exercises  further reinforced  training,  and  a  training  equipment package was  loaned to each city  for subsequent training use.  By the end ofFY 1998, approximately 10,160 first responders in thirty-two cities had received DPP training.

In FY  1997, the secretary of the Army was made the DOD executive agent for management  and coordination  of  support  to U.S.-hosted international  sporting competitions  and  other designated  special  events. The DOMS serves as action agent for this mission. In FY 1998, the first full year of  Army responsibility for the DOD special events mission, the Army provided support for the Goodwill Games, the Nike World Masters Games, the Special Olympic World Summer Trial Games, and several other high› visibility events.  Support provided under this program included security, safety, explosive ordnance disposal, aviation, and communications, as well as  standby-response  capabilities  for  potential WMD  incidents.  In  terms of the  Army  support  provided,  the  largest  FY98  special  event  was  the Nike World Masters Games, which involved twenty-five soldiers at a cost exceeding $130,000. Funding for this and similar events comes  from the congressionally approved Support for International Sporting Competitions fund.

The Army acquired additional  internal security missions in FY  1998. By  DOD  Directive  5160.54  (20  January  1998),  the  secretary  of  the Army was assigned executive-agent responsibilities for the Critical Asset Assurance Program (CAAP), intended to protect assets in the United States that are vital to readiness and operations. The DOMS was assigned as the action  agent  and  established  the  DOD  CAAP  office.  The CAAP  office has  conducted  a  series  of workshops  that  have  helped  orient  the  DOD agencies,  services,  and commanders  in chief to  CAAP  vision, concepts, processes, and expectations. In the summer of 1998,  the secretary of the Army assumed responsibility for the Office of the Secretary of Defense's Continuity of  Operations Program, intended to ensure that essential military missions continue in the event of  enemy attacks on the continental United States. The DOMS serves as the action agent, managing the planning and operations portion of  the program, as it does for the Army's  own continuity of operations program.

In early March 1998, the Army Corps of  Engineers entered discussions with the District of  Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) concerning assistance with infrastructure work. These discussions culminated in a memorandum

of agreement  between  the  Corps and  the  DCPS,  approved  on  17  April 1998. The Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6505) authorized assistance to  the  DCPS  for  FY  1998.  Using  this  authority,  the Corps  of Engineers  could  provide  technical assistance  but  could not  perform contracting on  behalf of state and local governments. For FY98 projects, the Corps of  Engineers gave extensive engineering and technical services, as well  as all acquisition and contract administration  functions (including construction inspection). The District of  Columbia awarded contracts and was  legally  responsible  for  all  contracting  actions;  however,  a  provision in  the  FY99  Omnibus Appropriations Act gave authority to  the Corps to provide  contracting  services  for  the  repair  and  improvement  of DCPS facilities.

The partnership with the DCPS resulted  in  the completion of  several critical  projects.  Work  included  replacement  of boilers  and  repairs  to elevators, emergency generators, air conditioning systems, and  windows. The  Corps  of Engineers  also  drew  on  a  broad  range  of capabilities  to assist with engineering and technical services involving master planning, geographic  information  systems,  and  facilities  management  databases. Comprehensive facility assessments were completed for all active schools, identifying urgent  needs amounting  to $440  million.  The  Corps  of Engineers also provided assistance in managing critical FY98 operations and maintenance needs. Additional ongoing work with the DCPS included development  of a  long-range  facilities  master  plan;  development  and support  for  improved  work  management  systems;  and  development  of management  plans  for  asbestos,  lead  paint,  and  underground  storage tanks. The Corps of  Engineers worked with the DCPS to share information with the community, key stakeholders, and Congress.  Reviews were held weekly  with  the  DCPS;  the  Corps  also  participated  in  meetings  of the board of  trustees and the board of  education, responded to media inquiries, and provided briefings to  explain Corps of Engineers assistance to other officials in the District of  Columbia.

## Declassification of  Army Records

On  1  January  1997,  the  adjutant  general  was  designated  the  Army's records declassification authority. The adjutant general subsequently delegated that authority to personnel in  the Army Declassification Activity (ADA) of the Adjutant General Directorate,  responsible for  the  automatic, mandatory, and systematic declassification programs mandated by Executive Order 12958 (17 April1995). Under this order, which prescribes a uniform system  for the classification, safeguarding, and declassification of national security  information,  all  classified information  contained  in  permanent historical  records  few  more  than  twenty-five  years  is  to  be  reviewed  for

declassification or  exemption from declassification. Documents not reviewed will be declassified automatically on 17 April 2000. This order thus requires the Army to  review approximately  270  million  pages  of documents dated before  1975.

Reviewing this volume of  classified material required extensive effort. In 1997, the ADA acquired contractual support from Kajax Engineering, Inc., to consolidate and automate more than  four hundred separate classification guides; develop a declassification training package; and provide a six-month proof-of-principle  test  to  validate  the  declassification  process,  develop  a database,  and  validate  the digital  classification  guide  and  declassification training  package.  The  test  conditions  required  the  review  of a  minimum of 5 million  pages.  For  the  proof-of-principle  test,  the  ADA  established, equipped, and  staffed a declassification  facility to  review material from the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) in Suitland, Maryland. The joint contractor- government effort analyzed the document review processes to  determine the  most cost-effective method  for  fulfilling  the  requirement within the specified time. The proof-of-principle test ended on 3 1 May 1998, with the ADA having reviewed more than three times the number of pages required. On 15 October 1997, declassification operations began at the Army declassification facility (ADF) in Arlington, Virginia. At the end ofFY 1998, the ADF had reviewed more than 24 million document pages. Desides ADF operations,  other permanent  historical  records  were  reviewed  at  National Archives  and  Records  Administration  (NARA)  facilities,  including  the National Archives, Washington, D.C.; the WNRC; and the Federal Records Center in St.  Louis, Missouri.  A total  of 117  million  pages were reviewed at all  sites.  By  the  end of FY  1998,  more  than  two  hundred  government and contractor personnel had completed declassification training. Training products  included a computer-based training package, a VHS training film and  script,  an  extensive  list of historical  DOD  and  Army  acronyms,  and an online Army Classification Guide that consolidated a number of earlier guides.

The DOD commitment to identify all information pertaining to the health problems of Persian GulfWar veterans has strongly influenced the conduct and organization of  Army declassification work. The DOD named the Army as executive agent for the associated declassification effort in  1995, and on 21 April of  that  year the Center of  Military History GulfWar Declassification Project (GWDP) assumed  the Army's executive-agent responsibilities. On l January  1997,  the  GWDP  was  transferred  from  the  Center of Military History  to  the  Personnel  Command.  On  30 September  1997,  the  GWDP finished the  scanning,  review,  and  declassification  of all health-related Army operational  Gulf War  records,  declassifying 30,300 documents. All declassified documents  were provided to  the DOD and subsequently  were posted on the Internet. On 1 October 1997, the GWDP merged with the ADA,

which identified more than two hundred points of  contact from one hundred government-wide organizations to assist the Army with its declassification eiTort.  In  February  1998, members of the ADA coordinated a  multi-tiered approach  to  reviewing  permanent  historical  records  that  were  classified secret or below  and stored in the  National Personnel  Records  Center,  St. Louis, Missouri, a satellite activity of  the NARA. This review began during FY  1998,  with completion projected  for early  FY  1999.  In April  1998, a memorandum  of agreement  allowed  the  Army  to  temporarily  remove documents from the National Archives II facility at College Park, Maryland, for  review  at  the ADF.  In  June  1998,  processing of the NARA  records  at the  ADF  began.  Another April  1998  memorandum  of agreement allowed the Army to  review  records fi·om the U.S.  Army Militaty History Institute (MHI) at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. The fu·st MH[ records processed in the ADF were on microfilm, which established theADF's  ability to review nonprint  media.  In  June  1998,  the  ADA  completed  the  review  of Army records,  classified secret or below, covered by  the provisions of Executive Order 12958 and stored at the WNRC (approximately 13 million pages). The GWDP element of the ADA reindexed GWDP's 2.3 million-item electronic archives, enabling the Office of  the Special Assistant for GulfWar Illness to search the  database with greater speed and accuracy.  A  new  organization, the Records Management and Declassification Agency, was scheduled to be created within the Adjutant General Directorate at the beginning ofFY 1999. That  agency  would  encompass ADA  and  other elements  of the  Adjutant General  Directorate,  such as  the  GWDP,  the  Armed  Services  Center  for Research of  Unit Records, and the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Division.

## Conclusion

The rapid movement to Kuwait of  the  lst Brigade(-), 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized), in February 1998 was perhaps the most dramatic Army deploy› ment of FY  1998, but it represented only one aspect of the Army's missions. Less urgent and ambitious deployments sent Army forces elsewhere through› out Central Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East on peac~keeping and counternarcotics  missions.  Still other missions  required  the  deployment  of forces for disaster relief to the Pacific and to Latin America, as well as within the continental United States.  Meanwhile,  perception of the rising threat of terrorists  using  weapons  of mass  destruction  (WMD)  produced  a  new  set of  Army responsibilities. All of these tasks were undertaken within the con› straints of  a National Military Strategy that required  the Army to plan, train, and equip for potential engagement in two simultaneous major theater wars.

Fulfilling such a  wide range of missions  required considerable effort. On 30 September 1998, the Army had nearly thirty thousand soldiers per› manently deployed to  more than eighty countries, plus  118,000 troops tem› porarily stationed forward, outside the United States. In all, this represented roughly  one-third of the  active Army  or one-seventh of the  total Army.  A daily  average  of 28,420  soldiers  were deployed  in  seventy-six  countries. This was  less  than the daily  average of 31,316 soldiers deployed  to  more than  a  hundred  countries  in  FY  1997,  but it  still  represented  a  demanding level of  activity in a wide variety of missions.

The  Army  had  to  meet  these  challenging  training  and  operational demands with diminished resources. In keeping with the recommendations of the  Quadrennial Defense Review,  active Army end  strength declined to 488,880  by  the  close  of FY  1998,  down  from  491,707  the  previous  fis› cal  year.  In contrast,  the active force  had  totaled 78 1,000 at the end of the Cold War  in  FY  1989.  Even  the decreased strength proved a  challenge to maintain.  The Army  fai led  to  meet  its  recruiting goals  for FY  1998. The service did exceed  its goal for  retaining personnel: Despite the  stresses of deployment, the Army achieved 105.5 percent of  its retention goals for first› time enlistees and  102.2 percent of  its goals for soldiers al mid-career. The decline in available personnel was matched by a decline in available funds. The Army's FY98 total obligation authority of $60.4 billion  represented a decrease of $3.8  billion  from  that of the  previous  fiscal year.  The Army's share of the defense  budget remained  constant at 25  percent,  despite  the

service's having provided the bulk of the forces in twenty-eight major joint military operations since FY 1989. The need to support operations required cuts  to  infrastructure  accounts:  The  Army  underfunded  base  operations support  by  $746 million and  real  property  maintenance  by $854  million, relative  to  requirements.  The Army  avoided  some  infrastructure  expenses through base realignment and closure actions, but these installation closures carried their own costs, notably extensive environmental cleanup.

To better meet extensive operational demands within its limited person› nel  ceiling,  the Army  took a  variety  of measures in FY  1998  to  conserve and enhance  its  human capital.  The service worked  to  improve  recruiting tlu-ough  new  data  systems,  planned  to  extend  and  enhance  basic  combat training to reduce attrition rates, and addressed potential retention problems by  expanding selective reenlistment bonus programs and  reducing admin› istrative  barriers  to  reenlistment.  At  the  same  time,  the  Army  worked  to improve recruitment, attrition, and retention rates by bettering the quality of life for soldiers. FY98 efforts in this area included studies and initiatives to increase stability (defined as time on a given station)  for  soldiers  between deployments;  the  continuation  of the  service's ongoing  effort  to  upgrade barracks and on-post housing; and new morale, welfare, and recreation ini› tiatives. The Army continued the process of opening more career fields  to women, which had begun in 1994.  It also worked to establish an improved climate for  female and minority personnel through a variety of  human rela› tions programs, including the Consideration of Others Program. These pro› grams were patt of  a general emphasis on the Army core values of  loyalty, duty,  respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage.

The Army also continued to rely  heavily on employment of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve to meet mission requirements in FY 1998. The reserve component made up 54 percent of  total Army force  structure, providing  combat support  and  combat  service  support  forces  needed  in disproportionate  numbers  for  operations  other  than  war  and  support  to civil authorities.  In addition, the reserve component has absorbed emerging missions, as demonstrated by the Army National Guard's  establishing Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection teams for domestic defense against WMD. In keeping with the Total  Force Initiative, which sought to integrate active› and reserve-component  units to make better  use of  the existing force structure, plans were implemented for integrating active- and reserve-component units into  the same divisions,  as well  as  activating  multicomponent units  below the division level.

In  the  face  of increasing demands on decreasing  resources,  the Army has  moved to  identify,  develop,  and  deploy  new  technologies  that  greatly improve unit effectiveness.  In  FY  1998  there  were  great strides  in  digiti› zationthc  use  of modern  sensor,  computer, and  communications equip› ment  in  networks  to  enhance the effectiveness  both  of individual soldiers

and of units as large as army corps. The enhanced situational awareness of digitized  forces enables them  to  operate over broader areas and  to  execute combat operations more rapidly and with greater certainty of friendly and enemy dispositions. Throughout the fiscal  year,  the  4th Infantry  Division (Mechanized)  conducted  extensive  experiments  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  to explore and refine digitization systems such as the Army Data Distribution System and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below.

Building  on  this  experience,  the  Army  evolved  new  organizations  to leverage these new  techJ1ologies  and  better exploit available  resources.  In FY 1998, the Army adopted a new organization for the Army's ten armored and mechanized infantry divisions. The new structure, Division XXI, reor› ganized these heavy division  types to reduce their personnel and  logistical requirements. It ditl so by cutting both th0 size and the number of  annor and mechanized infantry battalions in the division, while relying on the benefits of digitization  to  make up for  the  loss of  three  thousand soldiers and  thir› teen maneuver companies from each division's strength. Division XXI also broke new ground by integrating substantial numbers of  reserve-component soldiers into its combat suppott, combat service support, and stafi  establ ish› ments.  In  addition to  the  new  heavy  division  organization,  a  reorganized light division  was  under development,  as  was  a lightweight "strike force" successor to current armored cavalry formations.  Like Division XXI, both of these  formation types will  emphasize improved deployability and incor› porate digitization at all  levels.

The Army  also  has  worked  to  improve  its  logistical  arrangements  to get the  most out of the  resources  available,  using  the  same  technological innovations as  those involved  in  digitization to enhance its logistics.  FY98 logistical improvements included new systems for tracking supplies through radio-frequency tracking devices and bar coding in concert with automated inventory systems. Similar systems have been implemented to manage spare parts supplies and maintenance procedures. The Army's logistical systems also have been improved to support increased demands for strategic mobil› ity.  In  FY 1998, the Army expanded its maritime pre-positioning capabili› ties  in conjunction with the U.S.  Navy, acquiring the first three of fourteen new  large,  medium-speed,  roll-on/roll-off cargo  ships.  In  support of this enhanced capacity, the Army also has worked to enhance its logistics-over› the-shore  capabilities  with  new  landing  craft  and  floating  cranes.  These improved  facilities  should  combine  with  the  smaller  logistical  demands of the new divisional structure to  increase the strategic mobility of heavy forces in  particular.

The demands of  digitization and increased deployment levels have lent even  greater  importance  to  the  Army's development  and  modernization efforts.  To  exploit  the  information  resources  inherent  in  digitization,  the Army has continued to develop its weapons systems in an effort to achieve

and preserve overmatch capabilities in combat, enhancing existing systems while conducting research on new ones. A particular emphasis in FY 1998 was the enhancement of deep attack capabilities. A  variety of deep attack initiativesboth  acquiring  new  weapons,  such  as  the  Brilliant Anti-Tank precision-guided submunitions, and improving existing systems, such as the Multiple  Launch Rocket System and the Army Tactical Missile System› sought  to  exploit  developing  information  dominance  capabilities.  Along with  enhanced  range  and  accuracy,  an  important  goal  has  been  greater strategic  mobility  through  lowered  system  weight,  manning,  and  logisti› cal  requirements.  Efforts  were also  made  to  improve  the effectiveness  of light forces, both by integrating digitization systems pioneered in the heavy force and by accelerating the development of  such weapons systems as  the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System and  the  Javelin antiarmor missile. A major thrust of future  materiel development,  notably the Future Combat System slated to  replace the current generation of  tanks and armored fight› ing vehicles, will be the reduction of  vehicle weight to less than twenty tons, both to facilitate initial rapid deployment and to reduce the logistical tail of deployed forces. At the individual level, systems are  under development to equip the individual infantry soldier for a challenging environment encom› passing night combat, military operations in  urban terrain, and a  renewed threat from WMD.

By the end  of FY  1998,  the Army had progressed considerably in its transition from the forward-based Cold War force oriented against a specific threat to a power-projection force able to react to less-defined contingencies. The service had developed strategies to deal with the material and human costs  of the  post- Cold War drawdown;  simultaneously,  it  adapted to  the costs of the  new strategic environment with  its  multiple deployments and high tempos. The Army also took decisive steps to assimilate new technolo› gies with the potential to greatly improve its tactical, operational, and logis› tic  effectiveness even in its  new,  smaller  force  structure. These  initiatives show considerable promise for improving the state of  the Army's personnel, materiel, and operations. But being as ambitious as they are,  the  initiatives may be vulnerable  to  unforeseen changes in  the budgetary or strategic cli› mates.
