## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2000

## Introduction

Entering fiscal year (FY) 2000 and still relying on the 1997 National Military Strategy, the United States Army planned, trained, and operated within  the  same  fundamentally  changed  post-Cold  War  international environment that had characterized previous fiscal  years.  From  the  end of World War II  to  the  collapse  of  Soviet  power  in  1989,  the  National Military Strategy had centered on the need for the United States and its allies  to  contain  and  deter  Soviet  expansionism  through  forward-based forces focused on global operations, potentially involving the wholesale use  of  nuclear  weapons.  After  1989,  the  nation  faced  a  different  and more complex strategic environment. Wars between ethnic factions, the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the various means  to  deliver  them,  and  an  increase  in  the  scope  and  frequency  of international terrorism all characterized the new situation. As a result, the twentieth-century U.S. emphasis on fighting mid- and high-intensity wars gave  way  to  near-continuous  engagement  in  peacekeeping  and  nationbuilding work, among other low-intensity operations. At the same time, the requirement to address the Cold War spectrum of operations remained.

The 1997 National Military Strategy had three main thrusts: shaping the  international  environment  in  ways  favorable  to  the  United  States and its interests, responding effectively to threats and challenges to U.S. national  interests,  and  anticipating  and  preparing  to  meet  future  threats to the United States. The U.S. Army had a vital role in each of them. The Army shaped  the  international  environment  largely  through  its  various presence  missions,  such  as  peacekeeping  operations,  drug  interdiction, and international training and military exchanges. The previous fiscal year had seen a daily average of approximately 109,000 personnel stationed abroad and 31,000 soldiers operationally deployed in over sixty countries.

Overseas  presence  also  helped  the  Army  respond  to  threats  and challenges to the United States. The National Military Strategy committed the Army, in common with the other U.S. armed services, to plan, train, and equip for two nearly simultaneous major theater wars. The reallocation of resources in post-Cold War budgets posed major challenges. Over the decade that preceded FY 1999, the Army' s budget (in constant dollars) had declined by 38 percent and its active-duty strength by 36 percent. Nearly seven hundred installations had closed. Force structure had decreased from

twenty-eight to eighteen divisions. Procurement, despite recent increases, still stood at 57 percent of the FY 1989 figure. At the same time, Army missions had increased by a factor of sixteen in the current international environment as soldiers were deployed to deal with crises in such distant lands as Kuwait, Albania, and Kosovo.

This conflict between shrinking resources and expanding commitments shaped the structure and operation of the U.S. Army as it entered FY 2000. To reconcile the contradiction, Army leaders chose to emphasize strategic mobility to meet contingencies. Illustrative of this was Operation Desert thunDer in February 1998, when a brigade (-) of the 3d Infantry Division deployed from Fort Stewart, Georgia, to Kuwait in less than ninety-six hours in response to Iraqi provocation. The Army accomplished this deployment through the use of pre-positioned equipment stocks and elaborate logistical networks,  but  the  leadership  soon  recognized  the  expense,  inflexibility, and vulnerability of this approach. These drawbacks would drive much of the Army's research and development in FY 2000, as the service sought to obtain both powerful forces with reduced logistical impact and supply systems less dependent on masses of materiel positioned in forward areas.

Meeting extensive commitments with limited resources also demanded the most effective personnel possible to accomplish multiple missions  under  a  comparatively  low  personnel  ceiling. As  a  result,  in FY 2000 the Army continued to put considerable effort into recruiting the  best  possible  personnel,  giving  them  thorough  and  demanding training,  and  retaining  them  through  incentives.  But  in  the  post-Cold War situation, a strong civilian economy competed with the Army for recruits, and operational commitments complicated training. The strains of frequent deployment taxed soldiers and their families, especially in the face of the opportunities presented by a growing civilian labor market demanding workers with the technical and managerial skills imparted by Army training. Responding to this complex set of problems required the Army to improve the quality of life for its personnel, improving aspects of  the  financial,  communal,  and  physical  environment  strained  by  the long drawdown. Doing so forced the service to use its resources more effectively, not only through the use of technology to realize efficiencies in  management,  logistics,  and  training  but  also  through  new  human resources initiatives and budget reallocations.

Technology also drove the Army's activity in the third thrust of the National Military Strategy, that is, preparing to meet future threats to the United States. The most salient of these threats in FY 2000 was the Y ear 2000 (Y2K) computer issue inherent in many information systems both within  and  outside  the Army.  Inadequate  software  held  the  potential  to wreak havoc on 1 January 2000 as outdated computer systems failed to adjust properly to the new date. Measures to allay the Y2K problem were

well in hand by the beginning of FY 2000, but it was still necessary to negotiate the actual event.

Other pressing matters for operational forces included the evolving and increasing dangers of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction; proliferated ballistic missile technologies; and terrorist attack. Reorientation of force structure, equipment, training, and doctrine would be necessary to address these complex and interlinked threats. Similarly, Army leaders needed to address the military aspects of space, in particular the potential for space-based communications and reconnaissance systems to help the Army operate its powerful but relatively small forces to greater effect.

Their  recognition  that  new  information  systems  were  central  to achieving the battlefield goal of information dominance also drove efforts to  address  future  conventional  war  threats,  which  were  consolidated into the Army's digitization initiative. Despite traditionally receiving the smallest  Department  of  Defense  budget  allocation  (15  percent  in  FY 1999) for research, development, test, and evaluation, the Army continued to  develop  new  sensors,  computing  equipment,  and  communications networks. These tools now promised to give soldiers and commanders at all levels unparalleled knowledge of their tactical and operational situation, which would enable them to employ a new generation of precision-guided weapons  in  both  close  combat  and  deep  attacks  with  disproportionate effect. In FY 2000, Army leaders sought to exploit this promise sooner rather than later.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

The Department of the Army did not undergo any substantial changes to its headquarters organization or major command structures during FY 2000.

## Management and Information Systems

Late in FY 2000, the Army's Electronic Commerce Office began to undertake preparatory activities needed to support Department of Defense initiatives to implement smart cards and public key infra  structure (PKI). Based on an Office of the Secretary of Defense mandate, the Electronic Commerce Directorate began planning for the issue of smart cards to 1.4 million Army uniformed, civilian, and eligible contractor personnel. The Department of Defense intended the smart card to serve as a common access card (CAC) that could be used for personnel identification, building access, and computer network access via PKI certificates.

To aid implementation of the  Army' s smart card program, the Electronic Commerce Directorate devised a master schedule of planning activities. An  Army-wide  business process reengineering/functional economic analysis (BPR/FEA) study commenced in June 2000 to define the full lifecycle costs for the business process as well as program milestones and to  present  recommendations  for Army  decisions  regarding  the  targeted business processes and CAC implementation issues. The BPR/FEA study was still under way at the end of FY 2000.

The Electronic Commerce Directorate programmed funding of PKI and CAC implementation. For oversight, the directorate established the position of product manager for secure electronic transactions-devices in the Program Executive Office for Standard  Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS). It also identified existing Army applications requiring PKI support.

The Army replaced the aging Standard Installation/Division Personnel System-2  (SIDPERS-2)  with  an  improved  SIDPERS-3  system,  with the goals of increasing timeliness and accuracy of data in the Total Army personnel database and achieving Y2K compliance. During FY 2000, one

important aspect of the transition to SIDPERS-3 has been the test team' s development  of  the  interface  between  SIDPERS-3  and  the  database  to facilitate the processing of personnel transactions. The test team' s efforts were instrumental in the successful completion of Army-wide adoption of SIDPERS-3. The team assisted in identifying internal incompatibilities within  the  SIDPERS-3  software  and  prescribed  corrective  engineering change proposals to subsystems. These subsystems included the Enlisted Distribution and Assignment System, the Army Recruiting and Accession Data System (ARADS),  the  Total Officer Personnel Management Information System (TOPMIS), the Accession Management Information System,  the Army Authorization  Document  System  (Revised),  and  the Inter-Component  Data  Transfer  System.  The  test  team  also  facilitated full-scale development with the testing and fielding of two major releases of SIDPERS-3 software and participated in various Y2K testing phases. SIDPERS-3 also was modified to allow the dates on which DNA samples were obtained to be reported and stored.

Army personnel operations have historically required the generation and handling of large numbers of photographs.  The Department of the  Army Photograph Management Information System (DAPMIS), which began in the first quarter of FY 2000, had four objectives: eliminate the requirement for  hard-copy  photographs;  realize  substantial  material  and  labor  cost savings;  shorten  the  preparatory  time  required  for  selection  boards  and branch  assignment  detailers;  and  resolve  accountability  problems,  such as  lost,  incorrect,  or  damaged  photographs.  In  its  first  phase,  DAPMIS used  bar  coding  of  hard-copy  photographs  to  increase  accountability, reduce loss, and identify the correct photograph for each individual; in its second phase, DAPMIS developed the concept of a digitized photograph processing system and then designed and validated a working proof-ofconcept prototype. The projected third phase of DAPMIS will verify the solution with users and implement the system worldwide.

## Information Operations

Army Information Operations (IO) continued to evolve during FY 2000. The Army IO Campaign Plan, created in FY 1996, continued to govern Army IO initiatives. The Senior Information Operations Review Council, with the Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Operations  and  Plans  (DCSOPS),  the  Director of Information  Systems  for  Command,  Control,  Communications,  and Computers (DISC4), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (DCSINT), and the Commander of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center as its members, provided overall oversight for the IO Campaign Plan. The council, which met once during FY 2000, in December 1999, made a variety of recommendations concerning program objective memorandum (POM) items for FY 2002-FY

2007, unfunded requirements (that is, needs identified by the service that failed to receive funding in the budget), and other items based on the findings of the information technology (IT)/information assurance (IA) workforce issues study.  POM  02-07  and  unfunded  requirement  recommendations  included increasing  resources  for  civilian  and  military  recruitment  and  retention,  in particular  funding  for  a  degree  completion  program  for  specialized  IT/IA warrant officers; sustaining current resident system administrator and network manager education, training, and certification program as well as computerand Web-based training initiatives; and funding for onsite validation of IT/IA workforce survey data.

Other  council  recommendations  included  some  nonbudgetary  proposals on  both  military  and  civilian  personnel  initiatives.  For  the  military,  the initiatives increased the opportunities for Functional Area 24 (information systems engineering) and Functional  Area 53 (automation systems) officers to attend the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College; provided a selective warrant officer enlistment option for specialized IT/IA skills; copied an Air Force initiative to add an IT/IA category in the specialty pay and bonus option under Title 37 of the United States Code; expanded the responsibilities of brigade signal officers to include automation; and recoded the Functional Area 53 captain authorization in the brigade S-6 staff to a military occupational specialty 251 (data processing technician) warrant officer. For civilians, the initiatives encouraged the use of not only flextime and flexplace incentives but also an S code for individuals with IA skills/training and specific IT/IA training and certification requirements. The council did not endorse creating a team to plan and implement an Army Civilian IT Corps, instead requesting that a study team determine the feasibility of establishing such a corps.

Operational  considerations  also  affected  Army  IO  activities  in  FY 2000.  Following Moonlight Maze (the  code  name  for  an  investigation of a widespread series of intrusions into Department of Defense [DoD] computer  networks),  the  DCSOPS'  IO  Division  orchestrated  the  work of  an  interagency  team  chartered  to  manage  associated  investigative and operational efforts. At the same time, it also played a major role in a  series  of  working  group  sessions  that  ultimately  led  to  United  States Space Command assuming the DoD Computer Network Attack mission in FY 2001, as well as increasing the number of graduates from the Army Operational  Security  Training  Program  by  40  percent  over  FY  1999. Culminating in late December 1999 and early January 2000, the division and the Land Information Warfare Activity (LIWA) supported the Army's Y2K  response  efforts.  In  addition,  throughout  FY  2000,  the  division coordinated  LIWA  support  of  a  series  of  classified  computer  network attack exercises, as well as the overall Army response to the so-called Love Bug virus in May 2000.

## Year 2000 Transition

In both FY 1998 and FY 1999, much of the Army' s information systems personnel  had  concentrated  their  efforts  on  possible  problems  associated with the Y2K transition. Y2K problems arose in older computer software that allotted only two digits to calendar year, for example, by recording 1998 as 98. This characteristic had the potential to lead to problems ranging in scale from minor to catastrophic when such software attempted to process information containing dates for the year 2000 and later.  T wenty-first-century dates would thus be rendered as twentieth-century dates (that is, 1901 rather than 2001), with a resultant disruption of date-based calculations.

The  Army  placed  items  possibly  subject  to  Y2K  problems  in  one of  three  categories:  computers  and  networks,  telecommunications,  and facilities infrastructure, with the first two categories classified as IT and the third as non-IT. Items in the facilities infrastructure category included traffic lights, water pumps, card access readers, fire alarms, and elevators, as well as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The Army' s installation infrastructure in general avoided the Y2K problem. Because of low funding levels, installations generally continued using the older analog systems rather than more modern digital systems. The Y2K problem tended either not to affect these older systems or to affect them in ways easy to bypass. Y2K did not affect most weapons systems because they did not process calendar dates. However, many other Army systems, especially computing systems concerned  with  personnel,  finance,  and  logistics,  contained  substantial amounts of software code carried over from older systems that rendered them susceptible. By the beginning of FY 2000, the Army had substantially completed Y2K preparations.

By 31 December 1999, the Army had validated all its systems, and the transition took place without incident. Approximately 25,000 Army systems had been checked, and Y2K-related problems corrected or replaced, along with  more  than  475,000  personal  computers,  50,000  pieces  of  network equipment, and 70,000 facilities infrastructure items. The DISC4 Y ear 2000 Project  Office  estimated  that  75,000  Department  of  the Army  personnel were involved in the effort at a cost to the service of approximately $603 million. To confirm the validation and to cope with any unexpected events, the Army established  a Y2K Transition  Operations  Cell  to  monitor Y2K midnight crossings worldwide. The cell also monitored the Y2K leap day transition, another area of concern, at the end of February 2000.

## Economies and Efficiencies

The Army continued to implement initiatives begun in FY 1998 to improve efficiency and lower operating costs. Under the guidance outlined

in  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  Circular A-76,  the Army  began cost comparison studies in FY 1999 that, when completed in FY 2005, will  have  reviewed  functions  that  are  currently  performed  by  73,000 government-employed personnel, both military and civilian. These studies seek to identify functions that may be performed at lower cost in wages or overhead expenses by outside contractors. The Army reprograms savings realized from these reviews into Army force modernization accounts.

The  Army  has  actively  supported  Department  of  Defense  efforts to  implement  the  provisions  of  the  Government  Performance  Results Act,  which  seeks  to  improve  government-wide  program  effectiveness, government accountability, and public confidence by requiring agencies to identify measurable annual performance goals-metrics-against which actual achievements can be compared. In the secretary of defense' s annual report to the president and the Congress for FY 2000, the Army reported its actual FY 1999 performance against the performance goals laid out in the Department of Defense FY 1999 Performance Plan.

The  performance  results  were  generally  encouraging.  The  Army met its FY 1999 targets for overseas presence, force structure, strategic mobility, recruit quality, and enlisted retention but had minor deficiencies in recruiting  and  unfunded  depot  maintenance  requirements.  It  had more serious shortcomings in deployment tempo, with forty-three units deployed  more  than  120  days  per  year  as  opposed  to  a  target  of  zero, shortfalls  in  some  of  its  training  metrics,  particularly  tank-mile  targets and flying-hour targets. Tank-mile training (the number of miles driven per  year,  used  as  the  performance  benchmark  for Army  ground  forces) exhibited an improvement, however, over FY 1998 results for the active Army. Army reserve-component tank miles declined relative to FY 1998, while Army National  Guard  flying  hours  were  about  15  percent  below objectives but improved over 1998 levels.  Army shortfalls were the result of unexpected funding requirements in the budget year that forced the Army to divert resources from training to other programs (such as real property maintenance)  that  are  funded  through  the  Operation  and  Maintenance account.

During FY 2000, the Army Audit Agency issued 511 reports of four different  types:  formal,  consulting,  memorandum,  and  advisory.  The formal reports-that is, audits-resulted in potential monetary benefits of about $817 million and are subject to the Army' s official reply process. The consulting,  memorandum,  and  advisory  reports  produced  another  $556 million of informal monetary benefits that are not subject to the Army' s official reply process. In total, the agency received seventy-seven requests for audits, or about 32 percent of its audit program. Of the remaining audits, about 29 percent were mandatory audits, 15 percent were consulting, and the remaining 24 percent were internally generated audits.

The Army Audit Agency could not express an opinion on the Army's principal financial statements. Inadequate accounting systems, insufficient audit trails, and procedural problems prevented the agency from using any practical methods to conduct audit work of sufficient scope.  The accounting systems, and the systems that interface with the accounting systems (such as the Army's logistics systems), do not support financial statement-type reporting.  Therefore,  Army  management  could  not  provide  reasonable assurance that the accounting and non-accounting systems used to support the financial statements were reliable.

In accordance with a March 1997 memorandum of understanding with the Army's chief information officer, the Army Audit Agency examined the Army's response to potential Y2K computer issues. The agency found that the Army, at all echelons, addressed the Y2K crisis effectively. Army IT systems continued to operate, and the service developed, tested, and prepared to deploy contingency plans in the event of a problem.

## Budget

## FY 2000 Budget

The Army budget appropriation for FY 2000 was $70.8 billion. This figure was somewhat greater than the amount requested and represented approximately a 1.65-percent increase over the FY 1999 figure. Table 1 shows the major requests and appropriations.

The personnel funds in the FY 2000 budget supported an end-strength of 480,000 active-component soldiers, 555,000 reserve-component soldiers (350,000 Army National Guard and 205,000 Army Reserve), and 218,000 civilians. Both military and civilian personnel received a 4.4-percent pay raise beginning 1 January 2000. The budget also revised the military basic pay tables to increase pay for mid-grade officers and enlisted soldiers as an aid to retention and provided funds to restructure the REDUX retirement system implemented in 1986.

Operations funding for the active component in the FY 2000 budget supported ground operating tempo of 800 home-station training miles per year per M1 Abrams tank, of which 702 were achieved, and an average of 14.5 aircrew flying hours per month, of which 12.8 hours were achieved. Corresponding reserve-component figures were 184 tank miles budgeted, with 150 tank miles achieved for the Army National Guard. The Army Reserve  funded  9.5  aircrew  hours  per  month  (8.5  hours  achieved)  and the Army National Guard, 9.0 hours (6.3 achieved). In addition, FY 2000 funding  implemented  the Army's Aviation  Restructure  Initiative,  which increased the number of crews per aircraft to fully utilize the capability of the modernized fleet.

ten  brigade  rotations  (nine  active  and  one  Guard)  through  the  National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California; ten brigade rotations (nine active and one Guard) through the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana;  and  five  brigade  rotations  through  the  Combat  Maneuver Training Center, Hohenfels, Germany. In addition, the Battle Command Training Program received funds to train nine corps and division command groups together with their staffs.

The  FY  2000  procurement  budget  continued  to  support  Army modernization. The  budget  provided  continuation  of  the  modernization program for the Abrams tank and Bradley fighting vehicle, fully funding the first  year  of  the  four-year  multiyear procurement for the Bradley as well as providing for the final year of the current multiyear contract for the Abrams and preparing for its follow-on multiyear program. Aviation funding  supported  modification  of  basic  Apache  helicopters  to  the Longbow Apache  configuration  with  radar-guided  HELLFIRE  missiles as well as procurement of eight National Guard Black Hawk helicopters. Funding for the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles in the FY 2000 budget supported continued truck production.

Missile systems funded under the FY 2000 budget include the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Block IA and the multiyear contracts for the Longbow HELLFIRE and the Improved Target Acquisition System for  the  Tube-Launched,  Optically Tracked,  Wire-Guided  (TOW)  Missile. FY  2000  funds  also  procured  Brilliant  Antiarmor  (BAT)  submunitions, supported the third production year of the multiyear procurement for the

Javelin weapon system, funded Low Rate Initial Production for the MultipleLaunch  Rocket  System  (MLRS)  upgrade  (M270A1),  and  supported  the engineering and manufacturing development effort for the Guided MLRS.

The FY 2000 budget provided training ammunition and eight modern types of war-reserve ammunition items, as well as a modest reduction to the ammunition demilitarization backlog. Ammunition funds in the budget also supported production of the 155-mm. sense and destroy armor munitions.

The FY 2000 budget continued funding for a variety of command, control,  and  communications  systems.  Many  of  these  were  satellitebased,  including  the  Defense  Satellite  Communications  System,  the Super-High  Frequency  (SHF)  Tri-Band  Advanced  Range  Terminal, the  Enhanced  Manpack  Ultra-High  Frequency  (UHF)  Terminal  (also known  as  Spitfire),  the  Army  Milstar  program,  the  Single-Channel Anti-Jam Manportable Block I Terminal and Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal, and the Navstar Global Positioning System. The budget also accelerated the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System  data  radio  program. The  FY  2000  budget  introduced  funding for Block II software for the All Source Analysis System (ASAS) and Block IV software for the Maneuver Control System. In addition, the budget funded the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System, the Army Global Command and Control System, and the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control System.

While  the  projects  funded  were  essentially  the  same  as  in  FY  1999, the basis for the Army research, development, test, and evaluation (RDTE) funding shifted under the FY 2000 budget. RDTE base support funding (base operations, real property services, real property maintenance, environmental compliance,  conservation,  and  pollution  prevention)  resources  transferred to  the  Operation and Maintenance, Army, appropriation. The major RDTE projects  in  the  FY  2000  budget  were  the  Comanche  (RAH-66)  armed reconnaissance  helicopter  and  the  Crusader  howitzer.  In  addition,  missile systems under development included BAT Preplanned Product Improvement (P3I),  the  Multipurpose  Individual  Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the  High-Mobility Artillery  Rocket  System  (HIMARS),  the  Line-of-Sight Antitank (LOSAT) Missile, the Guided MLRS, the Stinger, and the ATACMS Block II. Digitization-related projects were also an important group of items in the RDTE budget, including continued integration and development efforts with the Army Battle Command System and the Land Warrior Program.

Military  construction  in  the  FY  2000  budget  emphasized  barracks renewal  and  strategic  mobility  projects.  The  Whole  Barracks  Renewal Program provided construction to improve the living conditions of single soldiers in the continental United States (CONUS) and abroad. Strategic mobility projects included railhead upgrades and aircraft parking aprons at Fort Hood, Texas, as well as another apron at Fort Bliss, Texas; a heavy-

drop rigging facility at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; and improved rail and container facilities at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Army family housing in the FY 2000 budget funded operation and maintenance  for  the  Army's  123,000  military  family  housing  units worldwide, including upgrades through a combination of privatization in the United States and construction projects overseas. Major maintenance and repair projects on approximately 1,000 dwellings would meet the goal of eliminating all inadequate Army family housing by FY 2010.

The FY 2000 chemical demilitarization budget encompassed research and development, procurement, and operation and maintenance. Significant program activities included continuing disposal operations at the Johnston Atoll  Chemical Agent  Disposal  System  and  the Tooele  Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, Utah, with chemical agent destruction to be completed in  FY 2000 and FY 2003, respectively; ongoing construction of disposal facilities at  Anniston, Alabama, Umatilla, Oregon, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas; completion of final designs and facilities construction at Aberdeen Proving Ground,  Maryland,  and  Newport,  Indiana;  and  continuing  environmental permitting, design, and supporting activities for construction of the Pueblo, Colorado, and Blue Grass, Kentucky, facilities. The budget also earmarked funds to continue studies, analyses, and equipment purchases for destruction of  nonstockpile  chemical  warfare  materiel,  as  well  as  funds  to  continue activities related to the Chemical  Stockpile  Emergency  Preparedness Project. Other funding for the Chemical Demilitarization Program fell under the Military Construction, Army, budget, including continuing construction of disposal facilities and activities at Anniston (Phase VII), Umatilla (Phase V), Pine Bluff (Phase IV), Pueblo (Phase I), Blue Grass (Phase I and depot support),  Aberdeen  (Phase  II),  and  Newport  (Phase  II).  Higher  phase numbers denote more advanced stages of remediation.

In  addition  to  the  regular  defense  appropriation  for  FY  2000,  the Department  of  Defense  requested a supplemental appropriation of $2,025.4 million for U.S. participation in NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)  peacekeeping  operations  in  Kosovo  and  United  Nations peacekeeping  operations  in  East Timor. The Army  received  the  largest amount of supplemental funding, with $1,489.5 million requested. Table 2 shows the major supplemental items.

The  Kosovo  (Operation Joint  guarDian )  funds  provided  for  support of  a  brigade-size  task  force  of  approximately  6,200  soldiers  in  Kosovo; 500  permanent-party  soldiers  and  500  transients  at  Camp Able  Sentry  in Macedonia; two base camps in Kosovo; one base camp in Macedonia; and two major troop rotations per year, mainly from units stationed in Europe. Personnel  funding  covered  incremental  pay  and  allowances  for  all  troops, including approximately  1,280  reserve-component  soldiers,  as  well as subsistence for all Department of Defense personnel deployed to the region,

as the Army is executive agent for funding common logistical support items. Operational costs provided sustainment for all common logistical support costs and specific Army operations costs, as well as incremental operating tempo costs (estimated to be nearly twice those in peacetime) and establishment of a command and control infrastructure in the region. Transportation funding supported two rotational deployments of personnel by air and major equipment items by sea, again mainly from units stationed in Europe.

East Timor  funds  requested  for  Operation stabilize were  to  support deployments of signal intelligence assets from the United States and initial travel, per diem, and sustainment costs for 106 soldiers from the U.S. Pacific Command  area  of  operation.  The  troops  consisted  of  a  small  infantry contingent, medical and headquarters personnel to augment the International Force  East Timor  (INTERFET)  headquarters,  and  a  planning  element  in Darwin, Australia, with forward basing in Dili, East Timor.

## FY 2001 Budget Request

The  Army  budget  for  FY  2001  requested  $70.8  billion  in  total obligation authority from Congress. Table 3 shows the amounts requested by account.

The FY 2001 budget structure maintained recent gains in readiness, quality of life, and modernization while initiating the transformation of the Army into a strategically  responsive  force  dominant  over  the  entire spectrum of military operations. The centerpiece of Army Transformation will ultimately be through the development of the more powerful and more responsive Objective Force. The goals of the Objective Force include the ability to deploy a combat brigade anywhere in the world in 96 hours, a division anywhere in the world in 120 hours, and five divisions anywhere in the world in thirty days.

Note : Totals may not add up due to rounding.

Based on FY 2000 statistics, the FY 2001 budget request supported an end-strength of 480,000 active-component soldiers, 555,000 reservecomponent soldiers (350,000 Army National Guard and 205,000 Army Reserve),  and  216,000  civilians.  The  FY  2001  civilian  end-strength figure represents a reduction of about 1.2 percent from FY 2000 strength. The budget provides a 3.7-percent pay raise for both military and civilian personnel beginning 1 January 2001.

The budget request addressed some of the Army' s most pressing readiness requirements. The budget called for a ground operating tempo of 800 homestation  training  miles  per  year  for  the  M1  Abrams  tank.  The  flying-hour program provided for an average of 14.5 aircrew flying hours per month for the active component, 9.2 aircrew flying hours for the National Guard, and 9.0 aircrew flying hours for the Reserve. The Operation and Maintenance budget included ten brigade rotations (nine active and one Guard) through the National Training Center, ten brigade rotations (nine active and one Guard) through the Joint Readiness Training Center, and five brigade rotations through the Combat Maneuver Training Center. The Battle Command Training Program received budgetary funds to train five division command and staff groups and conduct two corps Warfighter exercises, each consisting of the corps command and staff group and two division command and staff groups.

Major  mobilization  items  in  the  FY  2001  budget  request  included funding for the seventeen pre-positioned ships afloat as part of the Army' s Strategic Mobility Program. The Army scheduled its Prepositioned Ships

Program to enter its  final  phase  of  the  transition  from  the  interim  fleet to new construction large, medium-speed roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) ships. The Prepositioned Ships Program is expected to reach its end-state in FY 2002, with fifteen ships, eight of them LMSRs. In FY 2001, the Army will  continue  deployment  enhancements  that  include  the  infrastructure improvement program, unit-deployment container acquisition, and strategic deployment training.

Sustainment was an important budget area in the FY 2001 request. Existing  budget  items  for  sustainment  included  depot  maintenance, second  destination  transportation,  supply  depot  operations,  war  reserve secondary  items,  conventional  ammunition  management,  Army  prepositioned stocks, logistics automation, and sustainment systems technical support.  New initiatives  in  the  FY  2001  budget  supported  not  only  the transition to a single stock fund, an efficiency that will streamline supply and maintenance accounting, but also further testing and fielding of the Global  Combat  Support  System-Army  as  the  replacement  for  outdated logistics management systems.

The Army maintained its base operations support at minimum essential levels for FY 2001. However, real property maintenance funding for the active Army was only 69 percent of known requirements, and aging Army infrastructure continued to deteriorate. The FY 2001 budget sustained the real property inventory, with some risk.

Development and funding of an affordable, fully integrated modernization  program  was  central  to  the Army' s  transformation  plan. While the Army worked to implement a transformation strategy, the FY 2001 budget request remained committed to digitizing the first corps by the end of 2004. Planned modernization adjustments included accelerating a number of programs to improve strategic responsiveness and increase the  lethality  of  the  light  forces,  especially  the  acceleration  of  logistical command-and-control systems and software. The Army also invested in the maintenance and upgrade of systems currently in the force, incorporating technology  advances  through  selected  modernization  and  digitization enhancements  for  mechanized  and  light  forces,  along  with  continuing recapitalization programs.

Focused  and  sustained  investment  in  research,  development,  and acquisition  are  an  essential  and  inseparable  component  to  enhancing capability and strategic responsiveness. In particular, the FY 2001 budget requested funds for the Future Combat Systems (FCS), an Army program that  focuses  science  and  technology  on  the  development  of  Objective Force capabilities featuring affordable sustainment costs, reduced logistics requirements, and decreased crew size compared to current systems. The FCS is to be an ensemble of manned and potentially unmanned combat systems,  designed  to  ensure  that  the  Objective  Force  is  strategically

responsive and dominant at every point on the spectrum of operations from nonlethal to full-scale conflict. The Army science and technology program, in  partnership  with  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency, planned  to  develop  system  concepts,  perform  experiments  to  validate and refine those concepts, and conduct technology demonstrations. The development, engineering, and manufacturing phase has been scheduled to commence in FY 2006.

During the development of the FCS, the Army will field the Interim Force having many of the qualities of the proposed Objective Force but with  less  advanced  technology. As  a  medium-weight  mechanized  force built  around  an  existing  family  of  armored  vehicles,  the  Interim  Force will have greater combat power than existing light infantry but be capable of more rapid deployment than current armor and mechanized infantry. As such,  it  will  not  only  bolster  the  ability  of  the Army  to  respond  to contingencies but also provide the means for experimenting with Objective Force tactics and techniques. To meet the Interim Force requirement, the Army requested funding in the FY 2001 budget to field an Interim Armored Vehicle (IAV) as the principal equipment for a mounted brigade combat team.  Several  families  of  medium-weight  platforms  exist  or  are  under development throughout the world. With slight modification, one of these vehicle families could meet the initial IA V requirement with appropriate modifications.

In  addition  to  laying  the  groundwork  for  the  Objective  Force  and the  IA V -equipped  Interim  Force,  the Army  also  sought  to  maintain  the superiority of its existing combat force in the FY 2001 budget request. The service aimed to improve the lethality of its light forces by increasing investment  in  fire  and  battlefield  reconnaissance  programs,  such  as  the LOSAT  weapon  system,  TOW  fire-and-forget  missile,  and  HIMARS. These programs will enhance light force directand indirect-fire support capability. In the heavy forces, the Army sought to maintain the overmatching capabilities of III Corps by requesting funding to upgrade the Abrams fleet into a mix of M1A2 Systems Enhancement Program and M1A1D variants and to continue the upgrade of Apache helicopters to the Longbow variant. These investments will include essential recapitalization to reduce maintenance requirements and streamline logistics.

The  FY  2001  budget  request  included  several  programs  for  the maintenance  and  upgrades  of  systems  currently  in  the  force  to  sustain capabilities, to reduce the cost of ownership, and to extend service life. The Abrams recapitalization program consisted of three separate initiatives: a new engine with reduced fuel consumption; the Integrated Management Program, a total vehicle refurbishment program with substantial operation and  support  cost  savings;  and  an  effort  to  address  parts  obsolescence by replacing old analog electronics with new digital systems. The Army

proposed  budget  continued  funding  the  upgrade  of  Chinook  heavy-lift helicopters to the CH-47F variant, which includes a vibration reduction program projected to reduce operations and support costs by more than 22 percent and to extend the helicopter' s useful life by an additional twenty years. The budget also provided for the upgrade of the Black Hawk utility helicopter fleet to the UF-60L+ variant.

The Army made decisions in its FY 2001 budget request to restructure or  divest  a  number  of  programs.  The  restructured  programs  are  the Crusader self-propelled howitzer and the Future Scout and Cavalry System. Divestitures  include  the  heliborne  Prophet  (air)  electronic-intelligence system, the MLRS smart tactical rocket, the Stinger Block II manportable surface-to-air  missile,  the  Bradley  command  and  control  vehicle,  the Grizzly combat engineer vehicle, the Wolverine armored bridging vehicle, and the ATACMS Block IIA. The Army reallocated funding from these programs to underwrite transformation.

The FY 2001 Army budget covered a variety of other procurements. The budget sought funding for upgrades to the Bradley fighting vehicle, starting with the first year of a three-year procurement; for missile systems (BAT, MLRS, and TOW Improved Target Acquisition System); and for multiyear procurement of the Javelin and Longbow HELLFIRE antiarmor missiles. The ammunition budget request supported training at required levels for most items, provided for procurement of ten modern war reserve items, and funded a moderate demilitarization program.

Requested funding for aviation programs sought to modernize, upgrade, and  replace  existing  equipment,  including  continued  modifications  of basic Apache helicopters to the Longbow configuration. The budget also provided funding for six Black Hawk helicopters for the Army National Guard and critical combat service support programs.

Funding for the family of medium tactical vehicles will modernize the medium tactical vehicle fleet with state-of-the-art automotive technology to  fill  shortages;  improve  tactical  and  strategic  mobility;  and  replace obsolete,  overage,  and  maintenance-intensive  trucks.  The  budget  also funds the recapitalization of the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), which provides resupply support for combat vehicles, aircraft, and missile systems.

Satellite  communications  systems  funding  requests  for  FY  2001 included  the  Defense  Satellite  Communications  System,  the  SHF  TriBand Advanced Range Terminal, the Enhanced Manpack UHF Terminal (also  known  as  Spitfire),  and  the  Army  Milstar  program.  The  budget also requests procurement of the Single-Channel Anti-Jam Manportable Block  I  Terminal,  Secure  Mobile  Anti-Jam  Reliable  Tactical  Terminal, and the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System. Such command, control, communications,  and  intelligence  systems  as  the  All  Source  Analysis

System, the Long-Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3), and  the  Digitization Appliqué  were  also  funded  in  the  budget  request. Major system procurement for FY 2001 and the two preceding fiscal years are shown in Table 4.

| Abrams Upgrade 1 | 20        | 120       | 80        | Yes         |

The FY 2001 budget included an accelerated science and technology program  for  modernizing  the  Army  through  innovative  and  affordable upgrades  of  existing  platforms  to  achieve  advanced  capabilities.  The program objective is to apply related research and development performed by the commercial sector, the other armed services, and other government agencies.

The  FY  2001  RDTE  budget  request  also  included  funding  for development of a number of weapons systems. For the Comanche (RAH66)  helicopter,  the  FY  2001  budget  supports  testing  of  two  prototype aircraft  and  development  of  the  advanced  T801  engine,  composite  air vehicle,  and  mission  equipment  package.  Through  Crusader  program restructuring  efforts  to  improve  indirect-fire  support  capability  and  to reduce  overall  weight  below  forty  tons  while  maintaining  lethality  and mobility, the Army expects to save $11.2 billion between FY 2000 and FY 2014. As a consequence, it partially satisfies the requirement for 155mm. howitzers by continuing to use Paladin self-propelled howitzers and towed XM777s while also reducing the number of Crusaders for III Corps divisions from 1,138 to 480. In addition, missile systems under current development  and  funded  in  the  FY  2001  budget  include  the  BAT  P3I, the Multipurpose Individual Munition/Short-Range Assault Weapon, the MLRS, and the ATACMS Block II.

The Military Construction, Army, budget for the active and reserve components requested appropriations of $1.038 billion in FY 2001 new and renovated facilities to modernize barracks, improve strategic mobility,

and  support  Army  missions.  The  Whole  Barracks  Renewal  Program applies  $366  million  for  construction  to  improve  the  living  conditions of single soldiers. Strategic mobility construction requests totaled $67.3 million.  Mission  and  training  requirements  were  supported  by  requests for facilities funding, including a basic training complex at Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri  ($38.6  million);  unaccompanied  housing  at  Kwajalein Atoll  ($18.0  million);  a  digital  training  range  at  Fort  Hood,  Texas ($16.0 million); and the Cadet Physical Development Center at the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New Y ork ($13.6 million). The FY 2001 military construction budget also requested $175.4 million for chemical demilitarization.

The FY 2001 Army family housing budget requested $162 million for construction of 523 new and replacement units plus renovation of an additional 770 houses, together with $978 million to operate and maintain 114,555 military family housing units. The operations portion requested $398 million for maintenance and repair. In keeping with the Army goal to eliminate inadequate Army family housing, the Army planned to privatize some  family  housing  through  the  Residential  Communities  Initiative, allowing the Army to obtain private-sector capital to replace, renovate, and maintain military housing.

The Army's FY 2001 budget requested $1.3 billion for environmental programs.  Environmental  spending  is  spread  across  several  budget accounts:  Operation  and  Maintenance  ($571  million);  Environmental Restoration, Army ($390 million); Base Realignment and Closure ($285 million); Research,  Development,  Test,  and  Evaluation,  Army  ($25 million); and other appropriations ($27 million).

The Chemical Demilitarization Program was funded in two separate appropriations. In addition to the military construction request discussed earlier,  the  FY  2001  chemical  agents  and  munitions  destruction  budget request  of  $1.0  billion includes  research  and  development  ($274.4 million),  procurement ($121.9 million), and operation and maintenance ($607.2 million). Significant program activities generally followed those funded  in  the  FY  2000  budget.  The  FY  2001  budget  also  sought  to continue studies, analyses, and procurement of equipment for destruction of nonstockpile chemical warfare materiel and to continue the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Project activities.

## Army Working Capital Fund

The Army  Working  Capital  Fund  (AWCF),  essentially  a  financing vehicle  for  necessary  goods  and  services  at  stabilized  prices,  is  a  key contributor to the readiness and sustainability of  Army forces. Under the FY 2001 budget request, the Army would purchase $6.7 billion in fuel, repair

parts,  consumable  supplies,  depot  maintenance  services,  ammunition, and information services from the AWCF's four activity groups: supply management, depot maintenance, ordnance, and information services. The supply management activity group ensures that spare parts are available to maintain unit readiness; the depot maintenance activity group performs major overhaul and repair of end items and reparable secondary items; the  ordnance  activity  group  manufactures,  renovates,  and  demilitarizes materiel  for  all  Department  of  Defense  branches;  and  the  information services activity group provides development and operational sustainment of  automated  information  services.  Projections  for  FY  2001  AWCF customer rates included a 4.2-percent decrease from the previous year in supply  management  rates,  a  7.1-percent  increase  in  depot  maintenance rates, a 3.6-percent increase in ordnance rates, and a 26.5-percent decrease in information services rates.

## Personnel

As of 15 September 2000, the Army had a total strength of 1,043,052 soldiers, which was 832 more than the previous year' s figure. Table 5 below shows the strengths of the individual components.

Demographic  trends  within  the  Army  stayed  nearly  constant compared to the previous fiscal year. One notable exception was the increased  presence  of  Hispanic  soldiers  in  the  force.  In  FY  2000 Hispanic soldiers were 8.3 percent of the active force as opposed to 7.6 percent in FY 1999, a change Army personnel staff believed to be a reflection of both demographic trends and Army recruiting outreach. Tables 6 and 7 below break down the active force by race/gender and age.

The proportion of married soldiers, 53 percent, was slightly lower than the FY 1999 figure of 55 percent largely due to a drop in the number of married enlisted soldiers, both male and female. This trend may reflect the  success  of Army  initiatives  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  of  single soldiers as an aid to retention. Tables 8, 9, and 10 below detail Army family demographics for FY 2000.

The  major  personnel  initiative  of  FY  2000  came  in  October  1999, when Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki announced a four-year campaign plan to provide full manning, by military occupational specialty (MOS) and grade, for all Army units by the end of FY 2003. By the end of  FY  2000,  the  Army  was  to  man  its  ten  divisions  and  two  armored

cavalry  regiments  at  100  percent,  as  were  other  key  organizations  and positions, including special operations forces, drill sergeants, recruiters, and instructors. In addition, the chief of staff directed the Army Personnel Command to route soldier assignments directly to U.S.-based divisions. The campaign plan specified 100 percent manning for units designated as 'early deployers.'

## Enlisted Personnel

As of 15 September 2000, the 402,150 enlisted soldiers on active duty made up 84.0 percent of the active Army. The demographics of the force stayed fairly constant relative to the previous fiscal year. Table 11 below details the composition of the enlisted force in FY 2000 by race and gender.

Table 11-race and gender, enliSTed

| Race     |   Male (%) |   Female (%) |   Total (%) |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| White    |       58.1 |         37.8 |        54.9 |
| Black    |       25.9 |         46.4 |        29.1 |
| Hispanic |        9.2 |          8.6 |         9.1 |
| Other    |        6.8 |          7.2 |         6.9 |

The education level among enlisted soldiers increased in FY 2000. Of note, the number of nongraduates dropped tenfold, from 4.0 percent in FY 1999 to 0.4 in FY 2000, reflecting both demographic shifts and improved recruiting standards. Table 12 below details the enlisted education level in FY 2000.

To support General Shinseki's campaign plan to man all Army units at  100  percent,  Personnel  Command' s  Enlisted  Personnel  Management Division modified its FY 2000 distribution model and arranged for soldiers to be assigned directly to U.S.-based divisions rather than to installations.

Table 12-educaTion level, enliSTed

| Education                          | Number   |   Percent |
|------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Nongraduate                        | 1,372    |       0.4 |
| GED                                | 17,856   |       4.4 |
| High School Graduate               | 338,981  |      84.3 |
| Some College or Associate's Degree | 21,854   |       5.4 |
| Bachelor's Degree                  | 12,435   |       3.1 |
| M.A. or Ph.D.                      | 1,375    |       0.3 |
| Other or Unknown                   | 8,277    |       2.1 |

Distribution and assignment managers worked closely with field-strength managers to reassign soldiers within installations to comply with the new manning priorities, while making requisitions and assignments for other soldiers identified for permanent change of station. The Enlisted Personnel Management Division managed recruiting priorities for new soldiers to build strength in historically underpopulated combat support and combat service support MOSs, while maintaining divisional combat arms MOSs at 100 percent. The ten divisions and the two armored cavalry regiments ended FY 2000 manned at 100 percent, as intended. In addition, because of successful recruiting initiatives, reduced attrition among soldiers in their first  term,  and  successful  retention  of  soldiers  eligible  for  reenlistment, nonpriority  units  did  not  drop  in  strength  as  much  as Army  personnel planners had projected at the beginning of the year.

## Accession

The Army recruited 80,113 men and women in FY 2000. This figure exceeded both the fiscal year objective of 80,000 and the previous year' s intake of 68,209. Of the FY 2000 recruits, 74,190 (92.6 percent) had no prior military service. Educationally, 90.4 percent of the FY 2000 cohort (or  year  group)  held  high  school  diplomas  and  65.2  percent  scored  in Armed Forces Qualification Test category IIIA or better; both figures were slightly higher than the preceding fiscal years. Female recruits accounted for 21.2 percent of the total, versus 20.0 percent the previous fiscal year. Black recruits represented 23.3 percent of FY 2000 recruitment, a slightly lower percentage than FY 1999's 23.7 percent.

A variety of recruiting initiatives implemented in FY 2000 contributed to  the  Army' s  success  in  achieving  its  accession  objective.  General Educational Development (GED) Plus Program enrolls applicants who are

not high school graduates scoring in the top half of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery in local GED programs and places them in the Army's Delayed Entry Program in the interim. The College First Program offers the option for prospective recruits to enlist, attend college, receive a degree, and then serve a term in the Army. The Army has also made efforts to upgrade its recruiting force through professional sales training within and  outside  the  service,  as  well  as  by  outsourcing  some  administrative support functions to maximize recruiters' time in the field. The Army is also  increasing  recruiters'  uniform  allowance,  offsetting  their  parking costs, and increasing commanders' funds to expand family programs and recruiter quality-of-life programs.

Finally, the Army has expanded its outreach efforts through the media. The  service  retained  Leo  Burnett  Worldwide  Inc.  as  its  new  advertising agency in June 2000.  The selection took the form of a four-year performancebased contract, with incentives for the agency based on attainment of Army recruiting goals. Previous contracts had been requirements-based, calling for the agency to produce a given number of commercial advertisements and broadcast or publish them a given number of times.

The Army made significant changes to the Enlistment Bonus Program during FY 2000. On 18 November 1999, the maximum bonus level increased from $12,000 to $20,000, a rate that applied to four MOSs-MOS 13F (fire support specialist),  96H (common ground station operator), 98C (signals intelligence analyst), and 98X (linguist)-in return for enlistment for a sixyear term of service. The Army also linked the Enlistment Bonus Program and  the  Army  College  Fund,  making  it  possible  for  recruits  to  receive approximately 50 percent of the full reenlistment bonus (previously, since FY 1985, applicants had to choose between the two benefits). In addition, recruits  enlisting  for  two  years  in  any  of  twenty-one  MOSs  (ten  of  them in  the  combat  arms)  were  eligible  for  bonuses  of  up  to  $6,000,  where the minimum qualifying term had been three years. The enhanced bonus improved recruiting for the four MOSs assigned the highest bonus level, with 234 applicants receiving the maximum bonus. When compared to FY 1999, recruiting success in some of these specialties more than doubled: MOS 13F went from 73 percent in FY 1999 to 98 percent in FY 2000, 96H from 50 percent to 102 percent, 98C from 61 percent to 77 percent, and 98X from 65 percent to 80 percent. The number of recruits who took the reduced enlistment bonus with the Army College Fund was 4,660 and that for those who opted for the two-year enlistment bonus was 673.

## Attrition

First-term attrition refers to those initial term soldiers who depart the Army before serving a full term, measured through the thirty-sixth month

of service. Army personnel managers track first-term attrition by cohort. Over the last ten years, the Army' s cohort attrition rate has averaged 35-39 percent, meaning 35 to 39 of the 100 soldiers who entered the Army in a given year separated before completing three years of service. The Army projected first-term attrition at 33.3 percent after three years for the FY 2000 cohort, a significant decrease from the FY 1998 cohort projection of 37.4 percent.

In  an  effort  to  lower  training  base  attrition,  the  Army  has  devoted more of its  resources  to  programs  designed  to  reduce  motivational  and fitness-related discharges. Special training and holding units maximize the potential benefits of rehabilitative training for those soldiers who might otherwise  separate  early.  Fitness  training  units  are  for  at-risk  soldiers to  increase  fitness  and  reduce  injuries.  Physical  training  rehabilitation programs  provide  professional  assessment  and  treatment  of  injuries  to enable soldiers to successfully recover and return to an acceptable level of  fitness.  FY  2000  saw  an  increased  emphasis  on  providing  remedial training for those who initially failed to meet standards, with the intent of keeping these soldiers with their peers until graduation. The New Start Program is used for those who, after remedial training, still fail to meet standards. Given additional time, they are able to complete training and become productive soldiers. Army leaders also have focused attention on first-term attrition in units, with an increased emphasis on rehabilitative transfers that provide a change of commanders, associates, and living or working conditions.

## Retention

The Army exceeded its FY 2000 retention mission in all categories, as shown in Table 13.

Table 13-FY 2000 armY enliSTed reTenTion

| Category     | Objective   | Accomplished   |   Percent |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Initial Term | 20,000      | 21,402         |     107   |
| Mid-Career   | 23,200      | 24,118         |     104   |
| Career       | 24,800      | 25,791         |     104   |
| Total        | 68,000      | 71,318         |     104.9 |

To meet its goals, the Army expanded Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) funding by $44 million to $107 million to retain soldiers with critical and technical skills. Army leaders deemed this increase to be necessary

because of a strong economy and job opportunities in the civilian sector. A number of locations in the United States and Korea also used the Targeted SRB Program in FY 2000 to bolster retention. In addition, the Army lifted its rule requiring reenlistment earlier than ninety days before the scheduled end of term of service (ETS) to allow soldiers to reenlist until ETS. This relaxation concentrated efforts on retaining soldiers with current year ETS dates to meet year-end congressionally mandated personnel strengths.

## Soldier Citizenship Application Program

Soldiers  are  not  allowed  to  reenlist  for  service  beyond  eight  years unless they are U.S. citizens. By FY 2000, however, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was taking two or more years to process citizenship applications. The secretary of the Army therefore instituted the Soldier Citizenship Application Program to reduce the number of potential career soldiers being lost to this backlog. Under the program, the  Army assists soldiers with submitting their citizenship applications, and the INS Nebraska office provides facilitated processing for them. Soldiers applying under these procedures can usually expect to have their applications processed within one year. If necessary, they can also work with reenlistment and retention noncommissioned officers to have current enlistments extended beyond the eight-year limitation pending the processing of citizenship applications.

## Officer Personnel

The Army had 65,352 commissioned officers on active duty as of 15 September 2000, making up 13.6 percent of its active strength. In addition, the Army had 11,524 warrant officers, 2.4 percent of active-duty strength. Relative to FY 1999, minorities made up a slightly larger proportion of the officer corps, while the proportion of women was generally slightly lower except among warrant officers. Tables 14, 15, and 16 provide demographic data for the Army' s officer corps.

## Force Management

During FY 2000, the Director of Requirements and Force Management, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, executed a  number of initiatives designed to reduce an existing imbalance in the number of captains authorized within the Army Competitive Category. A 1997 study conducted as part of the Officer Restructure Initiative revealed that the Army had more than 1,400 captain authorizations than allowed by the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act grade tables. At the same time, the study indicated a shortage of over 1,500 lieutenant authorizations.

The Director of Requirements and Force Management implemented several  initiatives  to  reduce  the  captain  imbalance.  Total  Army  Analysis-07.1 eliminated  543  captain  authorizations.  Contracting  out  Reserve  Officer Training Corps positions eliminated an additional 330 spaces. Changing the grades of some captains in the directed military overstrength account saved 33 more spaces. In September 2000, the director received approval from  the  Army  vice  chief  of  staff  to  change  selected  battalion  S-2 (intelligence) positions in modified table of organization and equipment units and selected battalion S-1 (personnel) and S-4 (logistics) positions in  table  of  distribution  and  allowance  units  from  captain  authorizations to lieutenant  authorizations.  These  rollbacks  eliminated  200  captain

authorizations.  In  addition,  reductions  in  the  Title  XI  program,  which provides  active-component  support  to  reserve-component  training  and education, eliminated 157 more captain authorizations.

## New Military Occupational Specialty

The  establishment  of  the  new  Mobility  Warrant  Officer  MOS, 882A, led to the addition of mobility warrant officer positions in several transportation organizations, including transportation commands, groups, and battalions as well as movement control teams. Each active-component and National Guard division also added mobility warrant officers to the division transportation office.

## Officer Personnel Management Systems

The Personnel Command is in the process of reengineering TOPMIS, its  mainframe-based management information system into a distributed client-server computing environment, or TOPMIS II, as part of an initiative to improve access to and manipulation of officer personnel management data. TOPMIS II is to serve as a tool for not only the command' s officer assignment and distribution managers but also for the worldwide officer management  community  in  personnel  service  companies  and  military personnel  offices.  Since  1996,  a  team  of  military,  government,  and contractor personnel from the command's Personnel Information Systems Directorate and the Officer Personnel Management Directorate, which has operational control of the project, have collaborated on the development of TOPMIS II. The two directorates have worked under a memorandum of agreement that outlines the requirements for transferring TOPMIS II maintenance and enhancement responsibility to the Personnel Information Systems Directorate.

In FY 2000 TOPMIS II passed through Y ear 2000 without incident. The TOPMIS II software baseline completed certification for production, including  the  monitoring,  query,  strength,  table  administration,  utility, and  test  subsystems. The  requisition  and  assignment  subsystem,  which supports the core business practice of the Officer Personnel Management Directorate and will be the most heavily used module, completed testing. The TOPMIS II development team certified and placed into production the automated nightly data download of TOPMIS tables from the mainframe to the TOPMIS II UNIX database server. The team also provided fielduser  Web  access  through  a  new  server,  as  the  previous  server  had become  saturated  by  the  increase  in  user  usage,  and  installed  a  public key infrastructure certificate in accordance with the Army Network and Systems Operation Center.

The Officer Evaluation and Reporting System-Enhanced (OERS-E)  provides  the  Personnel  Information  Systems  Directorate and The Adjutant General Directorate, Personnel Command, a system to  capture,  track,  and  profile  senior  rater  data  obtained  from  officer evaluation reports and the three types of academic evaluation reports electronically.  OERS-E  is  used  by  the  Personnel  Command  for  the active Army, by the U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Command for the Army  Reserve,  and  by  the  National  Guard  Bureau  for  the  National Guard.  The  new  application  has  improved  the  Army's  ability  to manage  selection.  The  earlier  version  did  not  calculate  the  senior rater profile because senior raters could assign all officers the highest rating, making it difficult for selection board members to identify the officers with the greater potential for promotions and schooling. With the advent of OERS-E, senior raters are limited to awarding less than 49 percent of a given rank the highest rating. OERS-E also has three unique capabilities: improving record accuracy, prioritizing incoming reports,  and  transferring  data  electronically.  The  system  includes optical character recognition so that any errors in scanned images of reports can be corrected at Personnel Command without being returned to the submitting agency; prioritizes incoming reports for processing so that a report scheduled to go before a selection board will appear at the top of an examiner's queue while routine reports would follow, even if the command had received the routine reports earlier; and as of  FY 2000, successfully began sending documents to the Personnel Electronic  Records  Management  System  electronically,  thus  saving over seven man-years annually.

## Civilian Workforce

Since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  in  FY  1989,  civilian  strength  has declined  45  percent.  Overall  civilian  strength  for  military  functions, including  foreign  national  employees  and  National  Guard  technicians, decreased by 1,600 in FY 2000, from 224,900 to 223,300. Some 300 Army civilians deployed overseas in support of operations in the Balkans and Southwest Asia.

The average age and tenure of Army civilians has increased over the course of the drawdown. Average age increased from forty-three years in FY 1989 to forty-seven in FY 2000; average years of service increased from 13.5 in FY 1989 to 17.4 in FY 2000. Army civil servants eligible for retirement at the end of FY 2000 numbered 16,831 or 8.5 percent of the workforce. This figure represents an increase in both absolute number and proportion over FY 1999 figures-15,799 or 7.9 percent of Army civilian strength.

## Special Topics

## Awards

As the result of the review, required under the provisions of Section 524, Public Law 104, February 1996, of the Distinguished Service Crosses awarded  to  Asian  Americans,  Native  Americans,  and  Pacific  Islanders during World War II, the president presented twenty-one Medals of Honor at the White House on 21 June 2000. The Awards Branch, The Adjutant General  Directorate,  processed  ten  Medal  of  Honor  recommendations under the provisions of Army Regulation (AR) 600-8-22, Military  Awards ; under Title 10, United States Code, Section 1130; or as directed by senior leadership. Three recommendations awaited presentation after approval in FY 2000: Theodore Roosevelt (Spanish-American War), Andrew Jackson Smith (Civil War), and Ed Freeman (Vietnam).

In April 2000, the Awards Branch submitted a draft revision of AR 600-8-22 for staff review to the major commands; principal Headquarters, Department of the Army, officials; and other interested organizations. As the result of the review, The Adjutant General Directorate forwarded six major changes to the secretary of the Army for decision. These changes were to  establish  policy  and  procedures  for  processing  wartime  awards under the provisions of operations other than war; to delegate Meritorious Service Medal award approval authority to brigadier general commanders; to  authorize  commanding  generals  to  delegate  limited  award  approval to their deputies; to change the minimum three-month time requirement to  thirty  days  for  humanitarian  missions  receiving  the  Army  Superior Unit Award; to delegate nonretirement Legion of Merit award approval to  lieutenant  general  commanders, major general commanders at major commands, and major general or higher principal Department of the Army officials; and to eliminate the secretary of the Army' s signature on Legion of Merit certificates.

The president approved the establishment and award of the Kosovo Campaign Medal and campaign  streamers  to  recognize  the  accomplishments of military service members participating or in direct support of Kosovo operations within established areas of eligibility. The secretary of defense approved  the  acceptance  and  wear  of  the  NATO  Medal  for  operations related to Kosovo. This medal is authorized for U.S. military and civilian personnel.

The Department of Defense approved Humanitarian Service Medals for  the  Oklahoma  Disaster  Relief  Effort  (Central  Oklahoma),  May  to August  1999;  Operation stabilize (East  Timor),  September  1999  to September 2000; Joint Task  Force FunDaMental response (Venezuela), December  1999  to  March  2000;  West  Point  Military  Reservation  Fire

(West Point, New Y ork), July to August 1999; Operation aviD response (Southern  Europe),  August  to  September  1999;  Operation  A ir A ngel (Bangladesh),  September  1998;  Operation proviDe  reFuge (Fort  Dix, New Jersey), May to July 1999; Operation tornaDo relieF (Clarksville, Tennessee),  January  1999;  Operation Fiery  relieF (Philippines),  March 2000; Joint Task Force atlas response (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and zimbabwe), February to March 2000; and Texas Flood Relief (Central and South Texas), October to November 1999.

The  deputy  chief  of  staff  for  personnel  approved  major  changes, including a name change, to the Army' s Aircraft Crew Member Badge at the basic, senior, and master levels. Effective 29 February 2000, the designations became Basic, Senior, and Master  Aviation Badges.  The Personnel Command transmitted  eligibility  requirements  for  each  badge Army-wide,  directing that they be incorporated into the revised AR 600-8-22.

## Funeral Honors

Military  funeral  honors  became  a  statutory  benefit  to  all  eligible veterans on 1 January 2000. The act establishes that the minimum funeral honors for veterans will be two uniformed members of armed forces, one of whom must be a member of the deceased veteran's service, who will attend the interment service and fold and present the interment flag to the next of kin. A rendering of 'Taps' is also to be provided at the service. Although the Army chief of staff directed that the Army will not exceed the statutory requirement, he ordered a statistical study to determine if the Army should exceed the minimum requirement in the future. The Army standard for military funeral honors for active-duty soldiers and Medal of Honor recipients remains the same: six casket bearers, who would also serve as the firing party; an officer or noncommissioned officer in charge; a bugler; and a chaplain, if requested.

## Army Review Boards

The Army Review Boards Agency operates on behalf of the secretary of  the  Army  as  the  service' s  highest  administrative  level  of  review  of military personnel actions. The agency administers the Army Board for Correction of Military Records, the Army Clemency and Parole Board, and nine military review boards: the Army Discharge Review Boards, the Army Boards of Review of Eliminations, the Army Active-Duty Board, the Army Grade Discrimination Review Board, the Army Physical Disability Appeal  Board,  the  Army  Disability  Rating  Review  Board,  the  Army Physical Disability Review Board, the Army Ad Hoc Board, and the Army Security Review Board.

The Army Board for Correction of Military Records processed 15,670 cases to completion in FY 2000, received 11,096 applications for correction of military records, and reduced its case inventory from 6,061 at the end of FY 1999 to 3,320 at the end of FY 2000, with only 75 cases dating from before FY 2000. The board published a new edition of AR 15-185, Army Board for Correction of Military Records , and updated the Federal Register accordingly. A companion Department of the Army pamphlet was nearing publication at the end of the fiscal year.

The Army Clemency and Parole Board acted on 2,548 requests for consideration during FY 2000, processing 1,103 cases to completion. The majority of requests made to the board were clemency actions, including 1,018  requests  for  sentence  remission  or  relief  of  forfeitures,  of  which 26 were approved; 1,002 requests for change in discharge, of which 16 were approved; 12 requests for change in dismissal, none of which were approved; and 227 requests for restoration or return to duty, 1 of which was approved. Overall,  the  board' s  clemency  rate  was  1.6  percent. The remaining 268 cases involved granting, suspending, or revoking parole, with parole being granted for 59 cases, or 22 percent. The deputy assistant secretary of the Army (Army review boards) approved parole on appeal for eleven of the 63 cases he decided, or 17.5 percent, and revoked 21 paroles (6.8 percent) from a population of 310 parolees.

The nine military review boards processed 1,306 cases to completion in FY 2000. Of these, the Army Discharge Review Board accounted for 992.

## Noncombatant Evacuation Operations

Department of Defense Directive 3025.14, Protection and Evacuation of U.S. Citizens and Designated Aliens in Danger Areas Abroad , designates the secretary of the Army as the Department of Defense executive agent responsible  for  repatriation  plans  and  operations  involving  the  return  of noncombatant  evacuees.  Department  of  the  Army  Memorandum  10-1, Executive Agent  Responsibilities Assigned  to  the  Secretary  of  the Army , in turn designates the deputy chief of staff for personnel as the secretary' s executive agent for repatriation operations in support of evacuation plans developed by each theater commander. As executive agent, the deputy chief of staff for personnel identified specific installations and bases throughout the United States as repatriation centers to process not only military and civilian family members but also private citizens and third-country nationals. Based on the situation, repatriating personnel may return via commercial flights to multiple aerial ports of debarkation rather than repatriating en masse to or through a single designated U.S. repatriation site.

Twelve posts required evacuation in FY 2000, the same number as in FY 1999. In December 1999, concerns over the potential severity of Y ear

2000 problems in former Soviet states prompted the evacuation of posts in Minsk, Belarus; Chisinau, Moldova; Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vladivostok, and  Y ekaterinburg,  Russia;  and  Kiev,  Ukraine.  Other  noncombatant evacuations included Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Asmara, Eritrea, in May 2000; Suva, Fiji, and Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, in June 2000; and Monrovia, Liberia, in August 2000. None of the evacuations conducted in  FY  2000  required  the  establishment  of  a  U.S.  repatriation  site;  the evacuations mainly involved removal of small numbers of dependents and nonessential personnel traveling under individually arranged itineraries.

## Homosexual Conduct Policy

The homosexual conduct policy, which the Department of Defense approved in February 1994, implements Section 654 of Title 10, United States Code. This section, which reflects the findings of Congress that 'the presence in the Armed Forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity to  engage  in  homosexual  acts  would  create  an  unacceptable  risk  to  the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability,' defines homosexual conduct as a homosexual act, statement (admission), or homosexual marriage or attempted  marriage.  Under  the  homosexual  conduct  policy,  applicants for enlistment, reenlistment, appointment, or induction into the Army are not asked or required to reveal their sexual orientation, and investigations or  inquiries  will  not  be  initiated  solely  to  determine  sexual  orientation. Homosexual conduct is grounds for separation from the Army, but credible information must exist for disciplinary action or discharge.

The Army's numbers of service members separated for homosexual conduct  in  FY  2000  increased  significantly,  from  274  in  FY  1999  to 573 in FY 2000. The primary reason for the increase was an unusually high  number  of  separations  at  Fort  Campbell,  Kentucky.  Following  a murder determined to arise from antihomosexual bias in July 1999, Fort Campbell was the  center  of  intense  activity,  training,  and  focus  by  the Army,  Department  of  Defense,  and  the  media  regarding  homosexual conduct issues and harassment prevention. The increase in separations for homosexual conduct may be an unintended consequence of this activity. All  of  the  discharges  at  Fort  Campbell  arose  from  admissions,  which require no proof. In most cases when a soldier freely admitted to being homosexual, the Army assumed the statement to be true and separated the soldiers without investigation. No separations for homosexual acts or marriages occurred at Fort Campbell in FY 2000.

On 10 January 2000, the secretary of the Army and the Army chief of staff jointly signed a message to all Army activities emphasizing the necessity for all soldiers to be treated with dignity and respect. On 21 July 2000, the

chief of staff disseminated his own guidance in the memorandum 'Dignity and Respect in the Army,' not only directing commanders that all soldiers are to be treated with dignity and respect and that harassment of or threats to soldiers for any reason are not to be tolerated but also warning them that those who engage in, ignore, or condone harassment or threats would be held accountable. They also had to review distribution plans and fill priority for authorized company and platoon leadership positions; to build unit cohesion; to  review  policies  related  to  the  chain  of  command' s  responsibility  for barracks life and alcohol consumption and to take appropriate action to ensure compliance  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  policies;  and  to  review funding priorities for well-being initiatives with the intent of identifying those areas that will improve good order and discipline within units.

In addition to these instructions to commanders, the chief of staff also ordered the commanding general of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) and the deputy chief of staff for personnel to review current policies and training materials for compliance with Department of Defense and Army directives and guidance, in particular the homosexual conduct  policy,  for  adequacy,  clarity,  and  appropriateness  of  training  for different target audiences. In particular, the TRADOC commander had to incorporate homosexual conduct policy training during initial entry training and all leader development courses of instruction, covering how to distinguish between inquiries and investigations, how to provide greater clarity on what is credible information, how to furnish leaders information on the variety of responses available to address violations of Department of Defense and Army policies, and how to provide guidance on policy implementation.

As directed in the memorandum, The Inspector General of the Army was to inspect units and validate the effectiveness of training and to conduct periodic visits to assess whether the training meets the Army' s needs and whether soldiers at all levels understand the policies well enough to be able to comply with them. Training effectiveness was to be evaluated in three areas: knowledge, behavior, and climate.

## Safety

Accident reports compiled at the U.S. Army Combat Readiness/Safety Center showed that the Army had 161 accidental fatalities in FY 2000. The accident types and numbers were: aviation, 4; Army combat vehicles, 2; Army motor vehicles, 11; explosives, 1; fire, 2; personnel injury, 37; and privately owned vehicles, 104.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint for the Future

In October 1999, the Army chief of staff and the secretary of the Army issued  a  vision  statement  calling  for  an  Objective  Force  that  would  be responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable. This Army Vision built on earlier Objective Force concepts and stressed that the commitment to achieving these characteristics would require the comprehensive transformation of the entire Army rather than piecemeal innovation. To  accomplish  this  mission,  the  chief  of  staff  directed  that Army Transformation be conducted in accordance with a doctrine-based campaign plan model. The Army published the initial draft of the resulting Transformation Campaign Plan in November 1999.

The  Army  leadership's  intention  was  to  transform  the  service' s operational  forces  as  rapidly  as  possible,  while  continually  maintaining readiness  to  meet  mission  requirements  and  enhancing  the  well-being of soldiers and families. To accomplish these goals, the Transformation Campaign  Plan  set  forth  a  strategy  by  which  force  transformation would proceed in accordance with a series of decisions based on stated objectives  and  the  achievement  of  associated  conditions  to  produce  a force both strategically responsive and dominant throughout the spectrum of  operations.  The  Transformation  Campaign  incorporated  three  major objectives: the Initial Force, the Interim Force, and the Objective Force.

The Initial  Force  is  to  be  a  two-brigade  force  based  at  Fort  Lewis, Washington. These brigades will be equipped from commercial off-theshelf sources. The Initial Force will be based on units already stationed at Fort Lewis: the 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division, and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division. The force' s mission will be to evaluate and refine the Interim Force concept and begin development of the force's tactics, techniques,  and  procedures.  The  Initial  Force  will  use  existing  Army equipment, along with equipment loaned from foreign armies, to generate the data needed to design the Interim Force.

The Interim Force, as noted in Chapter 2, is to be organized as a rapidly deployable medium-weight force equipped with light armored vehicles for

providing theater commanders in chief with additional means to respond to smaller contingencies. In keeping with this mission, the Interim Force will help integrate multinational and interagency capabilities for peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and major theater war missions. Interim Force units will  be  employed  within  a  division  or  a  corps  command  and  control structure  but  will  have  organic  combat,  combat  support,  and  combat service support capability. Deployability, early operational effectiveness with limited support, and the ability to develop situational understanding will be essential to successful Interim Force operations.

Interim Force units will be highly mobile at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels and equipped with a family of light armored vehicles, lightweight artillery, and other available technology designed for maximum lethality and survivability while increasing tactical, operational, and  strategic  maneuver.  Self-contained,  fully  mobile,  and  completely air  deployable  by  C-130  aircraft,  they  will  deploy  combat-ready  and be  operationally  capable  upon  arrival.  The  air  port  of  debarkation  is intended  to  serve  as  the  tactical  assembly  area,  allowing  the  force  to begin operations without the time-consuming reception, staging, onward movement,  and  integration  required  of  past  deployments.  The  Interim Force will provide the joint commander increased operational and tactical flexibility  to  execute  fast-paced,  noncontiguous  operations  distributed across the area of responsibility, in keeping with the operational concept set forth by Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General John M. Shalikashvili in Joint  Vision  2010 .  These  units  will  complement  legacy  forces  to provide the tactical overmatch required to meet the full range of future operational requirements. In addition to its operational role, the Interim Force is intended to employ advanced but currently available technology to determine the characteristics and employment of the planned Objective Force.

The Objective Force effort is a process for devising and then changing the Army force structure with units and soldiers that not only operate differently but also display those requisite Army Vision capabilities for succeeding in future operations. Objective Force units will be capable of  winning  land  campaigns  in  major  theater  wars  while  remaining ready to undertake the rapid mission-tailoring required for responding to  crises.  They  will  be  versatile  enough  to  succeed  in  stability  and support operations, durable enough for extended regional engagement, and capable of operating as integral members of joint and multinational interagency  teams  in  the  face  of  conventional,  unconventional,  and weapons  of  mass  destruction  threats.  To  improve  planning,  training, and support, the Objective Force will be organized around a common divisional  design  and  out  of  necessity  will  be  linked  internally  and externally  through  a  responsive,  reliable,  mobile,  non-line-of-sight

networked  C4ISR  (command,  control,  communications,  computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) capability.

## Force Development

## Division XXI

Active-component  heavy brigades completed conversion to the Division  XXI  organization  in  FY  2000.  Division  XXI  brigades  feature three maneuver battalions, each with three companies of three platoons plus a battalion mortar platoon with four tubes, together with a new brigade reconnaissance  troop  for  non-separate  brigades.  The  heavy  enhanced separate brigades of the National Guard are to begin conversion with the beginning of the next fiscal year.

## Interim Brigade Combat Team

In May 2000, the Army approved the organizational and operational concept for the interim brigade combat team (IBCT) to provide a near-term increase  in  operational  and  strategic  mobility  and  responsiveness.  Each IBCT's 3,500 soldiers will be organized in a brigade headquarters; a signal company;  a  military  intelligence  company;  three  mechanized  infantry battalions; a reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron; an antitank company; an artillery battalion; an engineer company; and a brigade support battalion, as well as will be equipped with 309 interim armored vehicles in eight variants. The first formation to convert to the new organization will be the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, at Fort Lewis, Washington, with fielding planned to begin in February 2002.

## Force Management

Total Army Analysis 2007 (TAA-07), the fourth post-Cold War TAA, was a multiphased analysis to determine  Army force structure requirements for FY 2002 through FY 2007. The institution of a new force requirements determination  process  based  on  task  organization  for  specific  missions enabled TAA-07 to address smaller scale  contingencies   the  traditional , major theater war scenarios, and concepts (homeland defense, domestic operations  support,  strategic  reserve,  base  engagement  force)  resulting from the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel. TAA-07 addressed Force XXI designs for  the  digitized  heavy  division and available designs for echelons above division. In addition, TAA-07 included  the  first  formal  incorporation  of  the  institutional  Army,  or Generating  Force,  requirements  and  resources  (military,  Department  of

the Army civilian, and contractor man-year equivalents) into the process. A key outcome of TAA-07 was the incorporation of the Army National Guard  Division  Redesign  Study  results  to  offset  shortfalls  in  combat support  and  combat  service  support  (CS/CSS).  A  subsidiary  analysis, TAA-07.1, was an abbreviated and accelerated process for evaluating the impact of transformation and the establishment of the first three IBCTs on force structure between FY 2001 and FY 2003. TAA-07.1 was intended to capture the results of the chief of staff' s Army Transformation task forces (modernization,  CS/CSS,  manning,  and  headquarters  redesign)  and  the establishment of the IBCTs. The program objective memorandum for FY 2002 through FY 2007 incorporated the resource decisions for the IBCTs.

TAA-07  led  to  program  changes  to  multifunctional  logistics  and logistics headquarters force structure during FY 2002 through FY 2007. These changes included conversion of a variety of support units for echelons above  division  to  multicomponent  organizations  integrating  active  and reserve personnel and assets. The analysis resulted in three theater support commands  (TSCs)  and  one TSC  materiel  management  center  (MMC), two corps support commands (COSCOMs), two COSCOM MMCs being slated for conversion, and two area support groups and a corps support group in Korea. In addition, TAA-07 recommended inactivation of a corps support battalion in Europe and activation of a corps support battalion in Korea, as well as the retention of eight area support groups in the National Guard  as  command  and  control  headquarters  for  combat  support  and command service support units converting under the Division Redesign Study program.

TAA-07.1  used  revised  criteria,  including  factors  such  as  reduced consumption of supplies, reduced maintenance requirements, and increased span of control for headquarters units, leading to some changes in  recommendations  from TAA-07. These  changes  included  allocation of a TSC (-) in the National Guard as a homeland security support force and of fourteen corps support battalions, four corps support groups, and six area support groups as base-generating force units. The analysis also recommended converting two forward support battalions to brigade support battalions and activating two combat service companies to support IBCT requirements, converting a division aviation support battalion to the Force XXI organization, and reducing the number of base support battalions in Europe by one.

The  Command  Plan  FY  2002  process  conducted  during  FY  2000 led to several changes to TAA-07 recommendations for logistical units, including  delaying  conversion  of  the  logistical  elements  of  the  initial brigade of the 1stCavalry Division to the Force XXI design; and eliminating multicomponent elements of the 4th Infantry Division Support Command, returning all authorizations to active-component positions. The plan also

deferred  the  decision  to  authorize  the  498th  Corps  Support  Battalion (Provisional) in Korea until the next TAA.

TAA-07 also led to program increases to the Army ordnance force structure during FY 2002 through FY 2007. These increases included six Guard  missile  support  teams,  nine  Guard  explosive  ordnance  disposal companies, one active-component Patriot missile maintenance company, one theater signal maintenance company,  six theater signal maintenance platoons in the active-component and the Guard, and seven maintenance platoons and teams in all components. TAA-07  also recognized requirements for one collection and classification company, five nondivisional  maintenance  companies,  one  tracked-vehicle  repair  team, and one wheeled-vehicle repair team, as well as one medium ammunition lift platoon, one explosive ordnance disposal company, and two base shop test facility teams. The TAA-07.1 reassessment made no changes to TAA07 ordnance results.

TAA-07  led  to  several  decisions  to  program  increases  to  the  Army personnel  service  support  force structure under  POM  02-07.  These increases included the addition of eight adjutant general postal operations platoons to the Reserve, one military history detachment to the Guard and three to the Reserve, one judge advocate general legal support organization headquarters and three legal services teams to the Reserve, ten mobile public affairs detachments, four operations centers, and two teams to the Guard. In  addition,  TAA-07  called  for  conversion  of  Eighth  Army' s  Personnel Command headquarters and headquarters company to a multicomponent unit, including active-component and Reserve subelements, and recognized requirements for one replacement battalion headquarters and headquarters detachment and one replacement company. TAA-07.1 led to a reduction in force structure requirements, which in turn generated decisions to inactivate several  active-component  personnel  service  support  units  in  Forces  Command and  reduce  recognized  requirements.  Adjutant  general  units  inactivated included four personnel services battalion headquarters and headquarters detachments, two personnel detachments, one replacement company along with recognized requirements for another, and two postal services platoons, as well as two finance battalion headquarters and headquarters companies and one finance detachment.

The  Command  Plan  FY  2002  process  conducted  during  FY  2000 resulted in several changes affecting personnel service support units. The command plan called for inactivation of two adjutant general personnel detachments and one postal services platoon in U.S. Army, Europe, with personnel  authorizations  released  by  the  inactivations  shifted  to  the headquarters of the adjutant general units. The planned inactivation of one Guard military history detachment was cancelled. Seven judge advocate general  legal  services  offices  reorganized  by  adding  seven  new  teams

programmed in TAA-03 and by shifting five teams between the offices. All  TAA-07  inactivations  resulting  from  TAA-07.1  would  take  place in FY 2001 or FY 2002, except for one adjutant general postal platoon inactivation deferred to FY 2003.

As a result of TAA-07, Headquarters, Department of the Army, decided to program increases to the Army quartermaster force structure during FY 2002  through  FY  2007,  most  increases  being  associated  with  Division Redesign Study decisions. The Guard gained twenty-three petroleum supply companies, eleven water supply battalion headquarters, seven water supply companies,  eleven  water  purification  detachments,  one  mortuary  affairs company, ten quartermaster general-support supply companies, four supply and  service  battalion  headquarters,  and  two  aircraft  repair  parts  supply platoons. Equipment resource issues led to deferral of the decision to activate one petroleum supply company in the active component. TAA-07.1 led to the loss of the active-component general-support supply company at Fort Bragg, despite recognition of a requirement for the company. The Command Plan  FY  2002  process  resulted  in  a  delay  in  activating  some  petroleum, oil, and lubricant supply companies past FY 2002; converting two Forces Command  field  service  companies  to  the  new  modular  design  with  the laundry advance system (which significantly reduces water and personnel requirements);  and  establishing  the  requirement  for  an  airdrop  modified table of organization and equipment to support Alaska rigger operations that would convert the current Directorate of Logistics table of distribution and allowances operation.

TAA-07 led to increases in the Army transportation force structure during FY 2002 through FY 2007. The Reserve force structure gained two port, six area, nine regulating, and three cargo documentation movement control teams; two contract supervision detachments; one heavy equipment transporter company; one port operations cargo detachment; one logistical support vessel detachment; one harbormaster operations detachment; one railway  battalion;  and  one  railway  operating  company  to  the  Reserve. The Guard gained eight division support movement control teams, three automated  cargo  documentation  detachments,  three  terminal  battalions, three cargo transfer companies, three port operations cargo detachments, thirteen light/medium truck companies, three medium truck cargo (echelon above corps) companies, and one harbormaster operations detachment to the Guard. The active Army gained one cargo transfer company, one port operations cargo detachment, and two light/medium truck companies. One active-component and one Reserve heavy boat company, along with one active-component terminal battalion and one Reserve terminal battalion would become multicomponent units. In  addition,  Eighth Army  gained one palletized load system truck company, while Forces Command lost one such truck company.

TAA-07.1 resulted in decisions to inactivate two contract supervision and  one  lighter  amphibious  resupply  cargo  (LARC)-60  detachments in the active component. In addition, the analysis led to the withdrawal of  previously  recognized  requirements  for  three  area,  four  regulating, and  two  cargo  documentation  movement  control  teams;  two  LARC-60 detachments;  three  freight  consolidation  detachments;  one  automated cargo documentation detachment; one port operations cargo detachment; two medium truck cargo companies (echelon above crops); six medium truck petroleum, oil, and lubricant companies (echelon above corps); one terminal  battalion;  one  cargo  transfer  company;  and  two  harbormaster operations detachments. The Command Plan FY 2002 led to two contract supervision  detachments  and  one  LARC-60  detachment  inactivated in  Forces Command, one medium truck cargo company (echelon above corps)  converted  to  a  palletized  load  system  truck  company  in  Eighth Army, and one palletized load system truck company converted to a light/ medium truck company in Forces Command.

## Training

## Joint Forces Command

The most important Army exercises conducted within the Joint Forces Command  area  are  the  force-on-force  training  rotations  at  the  combat training centers. During FY 2000, approximately 40,000 soldiers deployed to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, in ten rotations and approximately 30,000 soldiers to the Joint Readiness Training Center at  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana,  also  in  ten  rotations.  Nine  division  and  corps command groups and their  staffs  rotated  through  the  Battle  Command Training Program.

## Central Command

Several training exercises in the Central Command area also support operations. Operation intrinsic action provides a near-continuous presence in Kuwait through a series of combined field training exercises with  Kuwaiti  forces. The  battalion-size  heavy  task  forces  deployed  for intrinsic action increase regional stability and serve as a visible deterrent to Iraq. Task forces built around 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry (August to December  1999);  3d  Squadron,  7th  Cavalry  (December  1999  to  April 2000); 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry (April to August 2000); and 2d Battalion, 70th Armor (August to December 2000) participated in intrinsic action in  FY 2000. Operation iris  golD is  a  quarterly  Special  Forces  exercise conducted with Kuwaiti forces to strengthen military-to-military

relationships. During FY 2000, the 3d Battalion (June to October 1999) and  the  5th  Battalion  (October  1999  to  September  2000),  5th  Special Forces  Group,  participated  in iris  golD .  Exercise lucky sentinel was an  Army  Forces  Central  Command-sponsored  command  post  exercise designed  to  train  Kuwait  Joint  Headquarters  and  U.S.  Coalition  Joint Task  Force-Kuwait  (CJTF-Kuwait). The April  2000  exercise  enhanced interoperability, maintained proficiency in rapid deployment, and refined complementary fighting capabilities.

Exercise bright  star was  a  joint  and  combined  training  exercise designed to improve regional security and defense capability. Participating countries included Egypt, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, France, United  Arab  Emirates,  Kuwait,  Jordan,  Greece,  and  the  Netherlands. Approximately 4,500 U.S.  soldiers  from  XVIII Airborne  Corps  and  3d Infantry  Division  (Mechanized)  participated  in  the  exercise  between September and November 1999.

## European Command

Army  forces in the European Command  area  participated in several  exercises  supporting  operational  deployments  in  the  Balkans. Exercise Mountain  guarDian II  was  a  mission-rehearsal  exercise  held at the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany, in late September  to  mid-October  1999. This  exercise  exposed  the  soldiers  to simulations of conditions and situations they would expect to encounter, emphasizing  scenarios  in  which  soldiers  needed  to  react  quickly  and make rapid decisions. Over 150 Hungarian civilians played roles as local political figures and former Kosovo Liberation Army members, enhancing the realistic atmosphere of the exercise. Units involved included the 3d Brigade,  1st  Infantry  Division.  Operation rapiD  guarDian-kosovo was a  night  simulated  tactical  parachute-drop  operation  and  ground  tactical training exercise in Kosovo on 1 October 1999. Its purpose was to evaluate and  demonstrate  the  Southern  European  Task  Force' s  (SETAF)  ability to respond rapidly to a contingency crisis situation and to reinforce U.S. elements of the NATO Kosovo Force, which involved a company team of 125 soldiers from SETAF's 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry (Airborne).

A  number  of  exercises  tested  NATO  rapid-reaction  capabilities. aDventure express was designed to deploy and exercise NATO's Allied Command Europe Mobile Force. The troops conducted field training and live-fire  exercises  in  northern  Norway  to  practice  joint  and  combined deterrent  and  combat  operations  with  NATO  and  national  headquarters and forces, as well as to execute a field training exercise in a cold weather environment. Over 360 soldiers from the 158th Aviation Regiment, the 54th  Engineer  Battalion,  and  1st Armored  Division  participated  in  this

exercise. Exercise aDventure exchange 2000 was a field training exercise designed to deploy the Immediate Reaction Task Force of the Mobile Force land element. The exercise ran from 19 to 27 September 2000 and included 240  soldiers  from  V  Corps.  Exercise arrcaDe  Falcon 00  was  a  field training exercise designed to deploy the signal units earmarked to NATO' s Allied  Command  Europe  Rapid  Reaction  Corps,  not  only  to  test  their combat information systems plans and procedures in a field environment but also to carry out interoperability testing, training, and development. Some  thirty-five  soldiers  from  the  5th  Signal  Command' s  7th  Signal Brigade took part in the exercise in June.

## Central Command

The  Multinational  Force  and  Observers  (MFO)  is  a  peacekeeping operation  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations,  established  by  a protocol to the 26 March 1979 Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel. The United States signed the protocol in August 1981. The MFO, which

assumed its  duties  in April  1982,  operates  checkpoints,  reconnaissance patrols, and observation posts along the international boundary to observe, report, and periodically verify that the provisions of the peace treaty are implemented. U.S. participation consists of an infantry battalion and the 1st Support Battalion. Soldiers on individual permanent change of station orders  man  the  Support  Battalion,  while  battalion-size  task  forces  of approximately 530 personnel rotating about every six months provide the infantry element. During FY 2000, the infantry battalions supplying the basis  for  MFO  task  forces  were  the  1st  Battalion,  502d  Infantry,  101st Airborne  Division,  from  July  1999  to  January  2000;  the  1st  Battalion, 5th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, from January to July 2000; and the 2d Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry, 82d Airborne Division, from July 2000 to January 2001.

## Military Intelligence

The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ODCSINT), Counterintelligence and Human  Intelligence Directorate, continued its functional management of the Foreign Counterintelligence Program (FCIP),  the  Defense  Joint  Counterintelligence  Program,  and  the  Security and  Intelligence  Related  Activities  program  submissions.  FCIP  initiatives included  counterintelligence  support  to  force  protection  requirements for the Intelligence and Security Command, European Command, and the 650th Military Intelligence Group. The Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Directorate  assisted  the  Intelligence  Policy  Directorate  in  preparing  information on Army intelligence capabilities for the 'Defense Intelligence for the 21st Century' study.  The study assessed both National Foreign Intelligence Program counterintelligence and non-FCIP counterintelligence capabilities and rated current  and  future  counterintelligence  support  capabilities  and  potential  support deficiencies to support national missions. The Army Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Modernization Program continued at all echelons, with Army participation in the Defense Counterintelligence Information System follow-on  development  and  progress  on  the  planned  integration  of  the Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Management Systems into the All Source Analysis System. Progress also continued on the integration of the modeling and simulation of counterintelligence and human intelligence into tactical simulation and the development of commercial technology for use by DoD organizations in the counterintelligence and human intelligence support tools Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration.

Congressional and media focus on the backlog with personnel security investigations drove the activities of the Personnel Security Section during FY 2000. The backlog was created as a result of defense policy decisions to reduce the workload of the Defense Security Service and a change in the national policy requiring more frequent reinvestigations for personnel cleared at the Secret and Confidential levels. By the end of FY 2000, the Army succeeded in reducing its backlog by one-third and had a financial and operational plan to eliminate the remaining backlog.

The Intelligence Policy Directorate was the Army' s representative to national, defense, and joint intelligence organizations, notably for the FY 2000 Intelligence Program Review Group. The directorate contributed to delivery and sustainment of measurement and signature intelligence and weather systems in the field.  The  Army Language Master Plan was approved in  January  2000.  The  Army  Language  Master  Plan,  which  provides detailed focus and definition to the Army Language Objective Force for FY 2000-FY 2008, goes into effect in FY 2002 and affects both activecomponent and reserve-component linguists at corps and lower echelons. In anticipation of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in 2001, the Army established a panel to prepare all QDR-related activities. Intelligence was placed under the auspices of the Information Superiority Panel with DISC4 as the chair. Much of the year was spent preparing position papers and briefings on the intelligence aspects of information superiority and in responding to the Joint Staff QDR Information Superiority Panel requests for intelligence information and positions.

The  Joint  Mobile  Integrated  Communications  System  (JMICS) operated in Albania, Bosnia, Greece, Korea, Kosovo, and other locations supporting  theater commanders  during  FY  2000.  Recognizing  its value,  the  Defense  Intelligence  Agency  provided  the  Army  General Defense  Intelligence  Program  with  $13  million  to  conduct  a  major upgrade  of  all  ten  JMICS  in  FY  2002.  Known  as  JMICS  II,  the  new system incorporates upgraded video teleconferencing equipment, organic communications, higher data transfer rates with asynchronous transfer mode, legacy capabilities, national intelligence through global broadcast service connectivity, and nonclassified Internet protocol router network connectivity, all capabilities that user surveys indicated theater commanders  wanted  incorporated.  JMICS  II  complements  the  Army Transformation initiatives by providing access to national intelligence, significantly faster data transfer rates with a greater volume of data, and a decreased logistical impact in theater.

The  Force XXI  Battle Command  Brigade-and-Below  (FBCB2) computer system is the keystone of the Tactical Internet being fielded in the first digitized division (FDD), the 4th Infantry Division. This network is designed to process information classified up to Secret. The requirement to  provide  security  clearances  for  all  individuals  who  use  the  system, however, would place a burden on FDD units. III Corps, the 4th Infantry Division' s  higher  headquarters,  estimated  that  meeting  this  requirement would call for a 200-percent increase in the number of clearances. The approved  version  of  the  FBCB2  uses  hardware  and  software  controls combined  with  appropriate  tactics, techniques, and  procedures  and security  classification  guides  to  reach  a  solution  where  not  all  soldiers require a security clearance. These actions produced a projected saving to

the Army of $12 million while ensuring that the Tactical Internet retained its capabilities to transmit classified information.

The Defense Joint Counterintelligence Program was established in FY 2000 by the deputy secretary of defense to strengthen DoD' s response to foreign intelligence service and terrorist threats to DoD critical technologies, information  infrastructure,  and  military  personnel  and  operations.  The program adds personnel to the  Army, Navy, and  Air Force counterintelligence capability  between  FY  2000  and  FY  2003. These  resources  will  provide increased capability against threats to military personnel, operations, critical technologies, and critical information infrastructure.

The Military  Intelligence  Functional Area Assessment,  a  combined effort between the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence and the U.S. Army Intelligence Center, was presented to the under secretary of the Army and the Army vice chief of staff on 20 January 2000. The assessment  examined  three  major  areas:  recommendations  from  the Intel  XXI  Study;  branch  and  doctrine,  training,  leader  development, organization,  materiel,  and  soldier  assessments;  and  an  institutional reengineering of military intelligence directed by the Army chief of staff as part of the Army Transformation Strategy.

The Intelligence Personnel Management Office divided its FY 2000 efforts  in  support  of Army Transformation between maintenance of the legacy Civilian Intelligence Personnel Management System, development of an interim system, and planning for the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System desired as an objective system. The office assisted with a director of central intelligence directive on intelligence community officer programs, taking the lead in developing a Department of Defense policy on employment, and worked with the intelligence community to finalize the intelligence community officer training program.

## Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Issues

In  FY  2000,  the  U.S.  Army  implemented  the  Chemical  Weapons Convention  (CWC),  including  continuing  to  meet  obligations  for  destruction of chemical weapons and former chemical weapons production facilities, as well as supporting inspections and visits at all declared Army facilities. This responsibility included inspections of ten storage facilities at eight Army  installations,  thirteen  chemical  weapons  production  facilities  at four Army installations, and one contractor location at Swannanoa, North Carolina. The  inspections  did  not  include  facilities  handling  chemicalwarfare agents or their precursors (CWC Schedule 1) at Army installations.

The  project  manager  for  chemical  stockpile  disposal  oversaw  the destruction of over 1,366 metric tons of various chemical-warfare agents. Inspection teams from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical

Weapons (OPCW) verified destruction operations at the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, the Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, and  the  Chemical  Agent  Munitions  Disposal  System,  with continuous presence by the inspectors.

The project manager for the nonstockpile chemical materiel project also oversaw the destruction of significant quantities of declared chemical weapons, again, verified by OPCW inspection teams. During FY 2000, the project manager oversaw the destruction of almost two thousand training rockets  and  their  associated  components  at  Hawthorne  Army  Depot, Nevada. Support to munitions recovery sites providing storage capabilities, overpack containers, and movement planning continued, with work during FY 2000 centering on the continued recovery of World War I munitions at Spring Valley, Washington, D.C. The project manager also began testing two  mobile  platforms  designed  to  destroy  recovered  chemical  warfare materiel. The Rapid Response System, designed to destroy World War II Chemical Agent Identification Sets, was tested at Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah. The Explosive Destruction System, designed to destroy World War I and World War II recovered munitions, was tested at Porton Down, United Kingdom.

The  project  manager  is  also  responsible  for  the  destruction  of all declared  chemical  weapons  production  facilities,  including  their buildings and equipment. Two facilities were demolished and certified by international inspection: the Pilot Plant Facility at the Edgewood area of Aberdeen Proving  Ground,  Maryland,  and  the  Bz  hallucinogenic-agent fill facility at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas. The demolition of the former VX nerve-agent  production  facility  at  Newport,  Indiana,  continued  on schedule.

The Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System plant demilitarization  operations  continued  in  FY  2000.  Preparations  also continued for the final demilitarization campaign, M23 VX-filled mines, which  began  in  September  2000. The  U.S. Army,  Pacific,  and  the  U.S. Army  Chemical  Activity,  Pacific,  in  conjunction  with  the  Department of  the  Army  and  the  Pacific  Air  Forces,  developed  and  submitted  an environmental-remediation plan based on industrial standards.

## The Army in Space

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) supports the National Missile  Defense  (NMD)  Joint  Program  Office  as  facility  design  and construction agent.  As described in the original memorandum of agreement, dated 20 May 1999, the USACE portion of the NMD program involves fasttrack design and construction with critical milestone dates that tie into a multibillion-dollar systems contract executed separately by the contractor,

Boeing.  USACE  has  received  design  funds  exceeding  $40  million  so far. The total scope of the design work is currently indeterminate. NMD construction costs are currently estimated at $1.13 billion. The estimated cost of construction is likely to increase as systems design processes and new requirements are identified.

The  USACE  worldwide  program  manager  is  the  chief,  Programs Management  Division,  located  in  the  USACE  headquarters.  The  U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama, is providing generic designs for tactical and tactical support facilities. Alaska District, USACE,  provides  overall  program  management  for  USACE  activities required in the event of an Alaskan NMD deployment. The district is also responsible for designing all nontactical deployment facilities in Alaska, managing geotechnical and topographic surveys, and supporting the NMD Joint Program Office for the environmental documentation process and, if required, real estate activities.

The FY 2001, military construction budget includes $85 million for the first phase of construction of the six phases planned. USACE is prepared to award contracts for construction of facilities once the decision to deploy is made, after a thirty-day period to allow for congressional notification. If no decision occurs by March 2001, the result will be a one year' s delay in completion, as the construction window for work at Shemya, Alaska, will be lost.

## Reserve Components

The two reserve components-the Army National Guard and Army Reserve-provide essential combat, combat support, and combat service support  to  the Army. The  mission  of  the  Guard  and  the  Reserve  is  to provide trained individuals and units that are ready to mobilize and deploy rapidly to assist the Army in projecting land power.

## Force Structure

The number of major reserve component units and their proportion of the total Army are listed in Table 18.

Over the course of the last several fiscal years, the Army has placed increased  emphasis  on  its  goal  of  integrating  the  active  and  reserve components  into  a  seamless  force.  A  number  of  initiatives  are  under way  to  facilitate  this  transition:  the  Guard' s  Division  Redesign  Study, multicomponent  units, active/Guard integrated divisions, and corps packaging and teaming.

The  Division  Redesign  Study  is  an  initiative  that  converts  Guard combat force CS/CSS units to meet wartime planning requirements. Under this plan, twelve Guard combat brigades and associated divisional elements will convert to nearly 48,000 personnel spaces of CS/CSS force structure. The study is a four-phase process that started in FY 1999 and will continue through FY 2009. Phases I and II will result in the conversion of 20,000 personnel spaces; the Guard has identified all units and states affected by these  actions. All  of  these  conversions  will  be  completed  by  FY  2007. Phases III and IV will be linked to the Army' s CS/CSS Transformation Strategy and will address Total Army Analysis FY 2009 requirements.

Multicomponent units, first formed in FY 1999, incorporate active, Guard, and Reserve personnel under one modified table of organization and equipment. This program allows active and Reserve units to integrate personnel  from  one  or  two  other  components  into  single-component organizations. A multicomponent organization allows the Army to provide personnel, equipment, and funding from multiple sources to improve Total Force integration and readiness while exploiting the unique capabilities of all components in combat, combat support, and combat service support capacities.

The purpose of integrated divisions is to use active-component division headquarters to provide training oversight to three Guard enhanced separate brigades (eSBs). This organization bolsters eSB readiness and enhances mobilization and deployment response time. In FY 2000, the 7th Infantry and 24th Infantry Divisions acted as integrated division headquarters, a mission begun in FY 1999, with the 7th having three light eSBs and the 24th three mechanized eSBs. Neither integrated division has forces beyond the division headquarters and the subordinate brigades; the brigades in the integrated divisions will deploy individually at the present time rather than operating as full divisions.

Corps packaging and teaming originated in the Divisional Teaming Pilot Program, implemented at the beginning of FY 1998, which paired the 1st Cavalry Division with the 49th Armored Division (Texas National Guard), and the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) with the 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized) (California National Guard) for mutual support. The Army selected additional divisions for teaming in FY 1999: the 3d Infantry Division (Mechanized) teamed with the 28th Infantry Division (Mechanized)  (Pennsylvania  National  Guard),  and  the  10th  Mountain Division (Light) teamed with the 29th Infantry Division (Light) (Virginia National  Guard).  In  FY  2000,  the  program  became  known  as  Army Teaming  to  denote  completion  of  the  pilot  program  and  the  potential for  future  teaming  of  CS/CSS  units. The  July  2000  revision  of  Forces Command  Regulation  350-4, Army  Relationships , documented  Army teaming. The vice chief of staff approved staff recommendations endorsing the feasibility of CS/CSS teaming in September 2000. A one-year pilot program  involving  two  active/Guard  and  two  active/Reserve  unit  pairs assessed  CS/CSS  teaming.  Forces  Command  provided  implementation instructions  for  Third  Army,  III  Corps,  and  XVIII  Airborne  Corps  in September 2000.

Corps packaging aligns Guard divisions and eSBs with active-duty Army  corps.  This  relationship  facilitates  intercomponent  integration, exercises, training associations, and organization of forces for contingency operations. The chief of staff announced this initiative during the National Guard Association of the United States Conference, on 14 September 2000. While  corps  packaging  and  teaming  are  for  different  purposes,  active/ Guard  unit  linkages  are  envisioned  to  be  the  same  wherever  possible, requiring some changes in division teaming to align the program with the corps packaging concept.

The report of the DoD Reserve Component Employment Study 2005 (RCE-05), issued in June 1999, recommended to the secretary of defense that the roles of the Army' s reserve components be expanded. In response, the Army's leaders adjusted their deliberate planning factors with respect to  the  availability  times  for  Guard  divisions.  The  RCE-05  study  is

expected to lead to the inclusion of Guard divisions in Change 1 to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, Fiscal Y ear 1998 (JSCP 98-1), the Joint Chief of Staff apportionment document concerning the required missions of unified combatant commands. Before FY 2000, Guard divisions were available  to  unified  combatant  commands  but  not  directly  apportioned. For Change 1 to JSCP 98-1, the Army has recommended apportionment of all fifteen eSBs and six Guard divisions to meet the requirements of the  unified  combatant  commanders.  In  addition,  two  Guard  divisions are recommended for inclusion in the base generating force, those U.S.based military and civilian personnel required to organize, train, equip, and maintain Army forces. Other RCE-05 follow-on studies concluded that  the  Army  National  Guard  has  the  potential  to  increase  its  role  in counterdrug operations (if funds were available), in the national missile defense architecture, and in certain peacekeeping operations. In addition, RCE-05  reaffirms  the  Guard' s  predominant  responsibility  for  combat service support as a role of the Army Reserve.

## Special Operations Forces

Army  National  Guard  special  operations  capability  resides  in  the 19th and 20th Special Forces Groups. In FY 2000, these units conducted numerous overseas deployment training missions consisting of not only unit-specific  training  but  also  counterdrug  operational  training  in  the Southern Command. A total of 914 soldiers performed training missions in Pacific, European, and Southern Commands.

The majority of the Reserve' s special operations forces belong to the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command. During FY 2000, these forces deployed for 119,854 soldier-days to sixty countries in support of every unified combatant command. They spent an additional 50,827 soldier-days in support of U.S.-based Forces Command-directed exercises,  unit  training  deployments,  and  attendance  at  formal  military schools.

## Information Operations

In FY 2000, the Army Reserve established the Reserve Information Operations Coordination Center, which serves as the higher headquarters for three information operations units.  Another new information operations unit  is  the  Land  Information  Warfare  Activity  (LIWA)  Enhancement Cell (LIWEC), providing direct support to the LIWA. The LIWEC will eventually merge into a multicomponent unit under LIWA. All the other information  operations  units  also  provide  support  in  computer  network defense to LIWA and to other agencies through LIWA.

## Strength and Personnel Management

The National Guard force structure authorization was reduced from 405,000  to  388,000  during  FY  2000. The  Guard  converted  designated eSB and divisional units to Division XXI design. High-priority units had overstructure  positions  reduced  to  5  percent.  State  and  territorial  area commands lost 15 percent of their discretionary positions. Participating units and the replacement combat support and combat support structure also initiated Division Redesign Study Phase 1.

In FY 2000, the most significant force structure changes in the Army Reserve were the reduction in Selected Reserve end strength from 208,000 to  205,000,  the  activation  of  nineteen  multicomponent  units,  and  the conversion of exercise divisions to training support divisions. Beginning in  FY 2000, the Army Reserve exercised its authority, approved by the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs, to apply an overstructure allowance in managing the force.

## Recruitment and Retention

Recruiting and retaining quality soldiers remains a critical leadership and management function within the National Guard. During the course of the year, the Guard met its strength goals through an ambitious program of recruitment and retention incentive initiatives. The Guard also employed a  wide  variety  of  incentive  programs  in  FY  2000.  These  included  the Selected  Reserve  Incentive  Program  (SRIP)  and  educational  programs, such  as  educational  tuition  assistance,  Servicemembers  Opportunity Colleges (SOC), and the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).

The Army Reserve also effectively used selected incentive programs. Federal  tuition  assistance  has  been  authorized  for  use  in  FY  2001.  In FY  2000,  incentive  and  educational  programs,  such  as  enlistment  and reenlistment  bonuses  and  the  MGIB,  assisted  recruiting  and  retention efforts.  One recruiting incentive introduced in FY 2000 was the MGIB Kicker, a program providing monthly educational allowances to non-prior service  and  prior  service  personnel  who  enlisted  in  a  critical  MOS  (as designated by the Department of Defense). Use of the Kicker proved to be an invaluable incentive for Army recruiters to offer prospective recruits. Recruiters in the field indicated that this program was a critical factor in their  ability  to  recruit  soldiers  into  the  Reserve;  the  MGIB  Kicker  was often the deciding factor in enlisting a potential recruit.

Efforts undertaken by the U.S. Army Reserve Command in FY 2000 will result in the addition of 300 Active Guard Reserve personnel for the Army Reserve in FY 2001. The Reserve's  military  technician  program will  receive  650  new  full-time  support  positions. This  increase  in  full-

time support will significantly enhance unit readiness. For the first time in ten years, the Reserve will exceed the congressionally mandated Selected Reserve end-strength objective. The synergy created from the command' s increased recruiting efforts and commanders' retention programs contributed to the Army Reserve meeting the end-strength objective.

Civilian  skill  management  for  Guard  personnel  involves  attracting civilians with specific critical skills, such as medical technicians and heavyequipment operators, through the Civilian Acquired Skills Program. The purpose of the program is to enlist qualified personnel with critical civilian skills. The individuals who possess these skills are subject to exemption from advanced individual training, which reduces in-service training loads and  cost,  although  exempted  personnel  still  need  to  perform  the  initial twelve weeks of active service. Personnel with no prior military service complete the nine weeks of basic training followed by three weeks with a unit that employs them in their civilian skill.

The Army Reserve has a Web site that it uses to identify the civilian skills of its personnel, www.citizen-soldier-skills.com. As of the end of FY 2000, a total of 2,150 soldiers had registered their civilian skills on the site. A marketing program to increase registration is under way.

## Training and Readiness

The Army National Guard did not receive sufficient Operations and Maintenance funding to support all of its training requirements. As of the end of FY 2000, Guard divisions are scheduled to reach full funding for training to platoon level in FY 2005.

The Army Reserve  received  adequate  Operations  and  Maintenance funds to support its programmed training requirements. Most shortages occurred  in  later-deploying Tier  4  units. The  Reserve  Personnel, Army, appropriation, however, was not sufficient to support training requirements in FY 2000. The Army Reserve Man-day Resource Model projected $122 million to support 266,000 soldier-days that are required to supplement fourteen days of annual training and forty-eight drill periods. The available special training funds covered only 45 percent of the requirements.

The Guard has formally structured a program that provides the training infrastructure required to incorporate training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators into the live, virtual, and constructive training environments. Its Distributed Battle Simulation Program, begun in FY 2000, follows a phased learning model tailored for the unique environment of Guard units. The program has four training areas:  individual,  battle  staff,  small-unit collective  maneuver  and  gunnery,  and  logistics.  Each  has  a  systematic, progressive, and measurable methodology. By integrating live, virtual, and constructive  training  devices  and  events,  individuals  and  units  at  home

station  armories  are  able  to  learn  those  tasks  and  processes  critical  for successful execution in identifiable, succinct increments.

The Army Reserve focused its unit annual training toward collective training  opportunities  and  instituted  several  new  policies  to  increase overall  unit  readiness.  Soldiers  are  now  prohibited  from  attending  unit annual  training  unless  they  are  qualified  in  their  duty  MOS.  Reserve teaching  institutions  are  now  provided  with  additional  resources  from their regionally aligned support command. For FY 2000, annual training Reserve units were more functionally aligned than ever before. The U.S. Army  Reserve  Command  developed  new  methods  for  accomplishing railroad and watercraft training. The Troop Program Unit Senior ROTC Force Replacement and Proof of Principle Program added nine additional schools. The future trend for both Reserve unit and individual training is to be more mission oriented in tactical environments.

The Army  National  Guard  Distributed  Learning  Program  provides functional  requirements,  courseware  development,  instructor  training, and support services. The National Guard Bureau's Distributive Training Technology Project/GuardNet XXI provides the only distributed-learning network  connecting  fifty-four  states,  territories, and  the  District of Columbia. As of the end of FY 2000, the project provided 234 distributedlearning classrooms, with an ultimate goal of 400, along with an integrated information system to manage scheduling, usage metering, billing, and access  to  a  courseware  repository.  It  is  designed  to  improve  readiness, to  enhance  command  and  control  during  state  emergency  operations, and to share usage of distributed-learning classrooms with agencies and organizations in the local areas.

The  Army  Reserve's  long-term  goal  for  distance  learning  is  to provide current standardized institutional training, and eventually virtual simulations and exercises, to all Army components, other services, and joint and international activities worldwide. The Reserve has aligned its program with the Army distance-learning program, which will eventually provide 861 distance-learning classrooms to ensure that 99 percent of the force lives within 50 miles of an electronic classroom by 2006. It plans to eventually have a tiered distance-learning capability at or near every one of the 956 Reserve centers. Evolving technology is ultimately expected to  allow  delivery  of  distance  learning  to  every  soldier' s  home,  thereby providing greater access to members of the Individual Ready Reserve.

The  Army  Reserve  Readiness  Training  Center  has  established  a digital training facility, developed and funded by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. The facility is organized into three classrooms, their primary function being to receive MOS training delivered from the various Army service schools. Classroom training is interactive; however, in FY 2000, a limited variety of courseware was available. In March 2000, the

classrooms gained Internet access as well as connection through a local area network, and one was converted to accommodate broadcasting.

The National Guard units use the Army's unit status report to update the Global Status of Resources and Training Systems (GSORTS) database. They complete this report on a quarterly basis, provide monthly validation reports,  and  submit  change  reports  immediately  upon  any  change  in  a resource area. Additional tools used to assess Guard readiness include the training assessment model, inspector general reports, and the operational readiness evaluation. The unit status report and the training assessment model provide quantitative data on resource levels and training indicators, and serve as a means for commanders to candidly state their views on their readiness levels. Generally, GSORTS-reported readiness levels of Guard and Reserve units have remained stable over the past fiscal year, although some  concern  exists  that  the  GSORTS  reporting  system,  developed  to support general mobilization, is not attuned to the impact of numerous ongoing peacekeeping operations on overall force readiness.

Guard readiness trends have remained relatively consistent throughout FY  2000,  but  have  shown  slight  declines  in  training  and  equipment readiness. Operational readiness evaluations are conducted less frequently because of inadequate full-time support and are done only on high-priority units. Analysis  of  these  evaluations  indicates  no  significant  decrease  in readiness. However, unit status report data has indicated slight declines in most readiness resource areas during the past year, attributable to funding shortfalls,  lack  of  equipment  modernization,  and  shortages  of  full-time support personnel.

Reserve  readiness  assessment  visits  and  inspections  during  FY 2000 indicate several consistent trends. Generally, the greater the fill level  of  full-time  support  personnel,  the  better  the  readiness  of  the unit.  Units  with  the  highest  resource  priority  are  the  units  with  the strongest readiness. Stationing of units in supportable recruiting areas continues to be another key factor in achieving strong unit readiness. Force turbulence continues to have a major impact on Reserve units, especially when unit staffing requirements increase or major changes occur in career field requirements. In many cases, a significant increase in  a  unit' s  personnel  requirement  has  led  to  a  substantial  decline  in its  readiness.  This  often  arises  from  a  recruiting  area's  inability  to support the recruiting of sufficient personnel. Due to downsizing, many soldiers must travel great distances to and from drill locations. Lengthy travel  requirements,  without  reimbursement  for  mileage  or  lodging, are  a  significant  cause  of  attrition  for  soldiers  located  far  from  unit drill  facilities.  Units  mobilized and deployed for overseas operations generally did not report major losses of personnel upon demobilization except for medical personnel.

The program of constructive and live simulations at combat training centers gives selected Army National Guard commanders a way to assess their unit' s ability to perform its wartime mission, as described in its mission essential task list. Guard units undergo operational readiness evaluations conducted  by  evaluators  from  both  the  active  and  reserve  components. In  addition,  the  Guard' s  operational  readiness  evaluation  program  tests individual soldier skills, physical training, and marksmanship, and includes only limited evaluation of collective unit skills.

In  addition  to  GSORTS  reporting,  the  Reserve' s  programs  for  measuring and evaluating combat readiness are similar to those of the National Guard. They include  lanes  training,  used  for  training  smaller  units  on  mission essential task lists; training assessment models; annual training; command post  and  field  training  exercises;  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center  and National Training Center rotations; and Battle Command Training Program exercises. In addition, the Army Reserve Readiness Command oversees the Command Assistance and Assessment Program that reviews priority units biennially. Not all Reserve units received an evaluation during FY 2000 due to contingency operations and budgetary constraints.

Guard unit readiness goals are set in the context of the Army' s force package system. Four force packages maintain readiness at four levels, as defined in The Army Plan. The most basic determinant of what level a unit is assigned is its deployment date. Early-deploying units have higher readiness goals and receive a proportionately greater slice of resources. The percentage for operating tempo funding ranges between 25 percent and 90 percent of requirements for all deployable forces. Other resource areas have similar ranges. The Army funded all Force Package 1 through 3 units at 100 percent of validated requirements, while Force Package 4 units received 60 percent of validated requirements. This resource methodology for Guard units demands that the Guard establish corresponding readiness goals. Priorities are revised as needed, based on changes in the Guard' s strategic force packaging, deliberate war plans, and short-term contingency requirements. In FY 2000, the Army National Guard moved 119 units into higher  force  packages. This  move  reflects  the  increased  assignment  of nearly all of the combat support and combat service support units to the two major theater war plans. In the short term, this shift will result in the higher priority units getting a smaller share of available resources and will impair their ability to achieve their established readiness goals.

The Army Reserve manages all resources under the tiered resourcing system, with Tier 1 being the highest priority and Tier 5 being the lowest. The Reserve distributes personnel, funds, equipment, and other resources to units, based on these priorities. Tiered resource categories and strategy are  expected  to  remain  unchanged  for  FY  2001,  although  changes  to individual tier level assignments may occur. During FY 2000, the Reserve

automated its process to manage tiered resourcing. The automated process allows a top-to-bottom review of each Reserve unit to identify errors and integrate any changes to the Army's occupational plans. The automated process  occurs  on  a  quarterly  basis,  with  the  results  forwarded  to  the Department of the Army for consideration of action.

During  FY  2000,  less  than  3  percent  of  the Army  National  Guard deployed  in  support  of  presidential  call-ups.  The  resulting  impacts  on readiness appeared to be negligible. However, when contingency operations led to deployment of less than full units, overall unit readiness suffered.

At present, the current presidential call-ups have not had a significant negative  impact  on  unit  readiness  for  the  Army  Reserve.  However, frequency  and  length  of  deployments  are  significant challenges  to recruiting,  retention,  and  unit  readiness  in  Reserve  medical  units.  The Army  Reserve  Civil  Affairs  and  Psychological  Operations  Command reported a slight decrease in unit readiness beginning in FY 1998. This decrease  was  directly  attributable  to  an  overlap  of  personnel  rotations to Operations Joint guarD and Joint Forge in Bosnia. Beginning in FY 1999, the command has reported consistent improvement in unit readiness every quarter, while the Department of the Army has reduced operational support  requirements.  However,  because  so  many  soldiers  had  been mobilized by the end of FY 2000 for these operations, some civil affairs and psychological operations specialties might soon experience a shortfall in senior grades available for continued presidential call-up due to failures of retention and deployment limits.

## Mobilization

## Deployments

FY  2000  saw  an  increase  in  Army  National  Guard  support  for contingency operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Southwest Asia. During the  course  of  the  year,  approximately  2,900  Guard  soldiers  supported Operations Joint Forge (Bosnia), Joint guarDian (Kosovo), and Desert spring (Kuwait/Saudi  Arabia).  The National Guard  mobilized and deployed 1,395 soldiers for Joint Forge during FY 2000. Units included medical, public affairs, aviation, and military police, as well as division headquarters-the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard, which served  as  the  command  and  control  element  of  Multinational  Division (North). FY 2000 also saw the first mobilizations of elements from two enhanced separate brigades as part of the maneuver force in Bosnia. In addition, an explosive ordnance disposal detachment from Arizona and a military police company from Rhode Island deployed. The Guard deployed more than 500 soldiers in support of Joint  guarDian  During  Fy  2000 .

For Desert spring , the Guard mobilized approximately 1,000 soldiers to support operations in Southwest Asia, where it was heavily involved in providing force protection assets.

The  Army  Reserve's  military-to-military  participation  throughout the  world  during  FY  2000  included  formal  programs,  exercises,  and contingency  operations. The  Reserve  units  participated  in  a  number  of operational  missions  outside  the  continental  United  States,  including Operations Desert thunDer, Desert Fox, Desert Falcon, Desert Focus, northern  Watch , and southern  Watch . Joint exercises included roving sanDs, paciFic Warrior, nuevos horizontes, yaMa sakura , and consequence  ManageMent 2000.  During  FY  2000,  the  Army  Reserve supported  Operation Joint  guarDian with  1,935  soldiers  and  345,701 soldier-days and Operation Joint Forge with 2,913 soldiers and 526,683 soldier-days.

## Intelligence

The National Guard provides contributory intelligence support (CIS) through  four  interrelated  programs:  the  Defense  Intelligence  Reserve Program,  the  Joint  Reserve  Intelligence  Program,  the  Army  Language Master  Plan,  and  Readiness  Training.  CIS  tours  supported  peacetime, contingency,  and  surge  requirements  of  agencies  and  commanders, relieving personnel tempo and providing Guardsmen with essential skills training  and  hands-on  experience. The  248  Guardsmen  working  in  the CIS  program  produced  over  11,691  soldier-days  in  support  of  fifteen agencies, unified combatant commands, and the Joint Staff. This support was rendered at fourteen U.S. and overseas locations.

In FY 2000, the Army Reserve developed a new military intelligence force structure that supports unified combatant command missions. Over the next four to five years, the Reserve will reduce its signal intelligence assets  and  refocus  to  create  and  train  force  protection-oriented  assets, counterintelligence units, and improved analytical intelligence capabilities. Use of military intelligence soldiers continued to grow, as the Army and DoD recognized that the active-component structure was insufficient to meet the demands of the defense intelligence community. A number of individuals  and  troop  program  units  volunteered  or  were  mobilized  to support operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, and other areas.

## Reserve-Component Support to Civil Authorities

In FY 2000, a total of 56 National Guard Special Operations forces participated in counternarcotic operations in Southern and Pacific Commands.  Typical  counternarcotic  missions  were  training  of  host-

nation  law  enforcement  personnel  and  joint  planning  and  assistance team missions. The Army Reserve supported more than 200 counterdrug missions  with  313  soldiers  and  more  than  33,000  soldier-days.  Drug law enforcement agencies typically request and receive Reserve support for intelligence analysts or linguists. These personnel work closely with criminal  investigators  to  assist  with  the  intelligence  aspects  of  ongoing drug cases.

The  National  Guard  entered  the  DoD  Consequence  Management Program with the establishment of ten civil support teams in FY 1999. Congress  authorized  and  appropriated  funding  for  seventeen  additional teams, in keeping with congressional intent of establishing a civil support team  capability  in  each  state  and  territory. These  teams  will  be  DoD' s lead  responders to civilian  requests  for  assistance  to  suspected  terrorist attacks using weapons of mass destruction. Ten Guard civil support teams received significant equipment in FY 2000, with an additional seventeen scheduled to receive key equipment beginning in June 2001.

Army  Reserve  chemical  units  have  received  specialized  training to provide  consequence  management  support  involving  weapons  of mass destruction. Twenty-five chemical companies trained for domestic response casualty decontamination support. Two chemical reconnaissance units received training that will enable them to perform reconnaissance missions during a domestic response effort. The Army Reserve did not procure  any  homeland  defense  equipment  during  FY  2000,  but  it  was awaiting  delivery  of  $3.78  million  of  equipment  procured  in  FY  1999. This equipment was funded by Program Budget Decision 712 to equip Reserve  chemical  reconnaissance  and  decontamination  companies  to support  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the  overall  federal  response  to domestic terrorism involving the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Reserve still needs equipment for two chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear reconnaissance companies and twenty-five decontamination companies.

Under the DoD Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) program, more than 9,600 Guardsmen from twenty-six states provided more than 225,000 soldier-days  in  FY  2000  to  improve  schools  and  recreation  facilities, to  build  and  maintain  roads,  and  to  provide  medical  and  dental  care  to underserved populations. Soldiers from fifty-four states, territories,  and the  District  of  Columbia  provided  more  than  150,000  soldier-days  of domestic support. Significant missions included responses to hurricanes along  the  Atlantic  and  Gulf  coasts;  wildfires  throughout  the  Midwest, Northwest, and Florida; Y2K concerns; and the World Trade Organization riots in Seattle.

In FY 2000, Reserve units conducted hands-on training for reservists while assisting local communities in eighteen states with IRT missions.

These activities included dental units assisting ten isolated Native  American villages; seven health care and well-being projects for homeless veterans; numerous projects supporting the Boy Scouts and the Special Olympics; support to colleges, universities, local police, and fire departments; medical support  to  the  New  Y ork  City  Marathon;  artificial  reef  construction; support for the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey; and public safety support to the city of San Francisco.

## Equipment and Maintenance

## Equipment

The National Guard had 85 percent of the readiness requirement for equipment on-hand in FY 2000, while the Army Reserve had 78 percent. Both figures represented a decline from FY 1999 inventories, 91 and 87 percent, respectively. Major Guard equipment shortages included tracked combat  vehicles,  AN/VRC-12  vehicular  radios,  5-ton  wreckers,  heavy equipment  transporter  tractors,  and  night-vision  devices.  The  major Reserve equipment shortage was AN/VRC-12 radios.

One help for  reserve-component  equipment  shortfalls  has  been  the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Appropriation (NGREA). Several years  earlier,  DoD  reiterated  its  policy  that  parent  services  held  sole responsibility for funding the equipment requirements of their Guard and Reserve components, thus eliminating action by Congress to add funding outside  the  formal  budget  process.  Since  1997,  NGREA  funding  has therefore diminished significantly, as shown in Table 19. In the short term, however, FY 2000 funding increased considerably over the previous year, funding procurement of a wide variety of combat, combat support, and combat service support equipment.

Table 19-armY ngrea bY FiScal Year ( Millions of Dollars )

|   FY | Army NGREA   |
|------|--------------|
| 1997 | $100.80      |
| 1998 | $68.80       |
| 1999 | $20.00       |
| 2000 | $29.84       |

Another  alternative for providing  reserve-component  units  with equipment  is  the  transfer  of  assets  from  active-component  stockpiles. In  FY 2000, transfers to the National Guard included M1 tanks, AH-1

helicopters, armored vehicle-launched bridges, 5-ton trucks, M35A3 2½ton  trucks,  high-mobility  multipurpose  wheeled  vehicles  (HMMWVs), single-channel  ground  and  airborne  radio  system  (SINCGARS)  radios, and night-vision goggles. The Army Reserve received UH-60 and CH-47 helicopters, ATLAS all-terrain forklifts, 5- and 2½-ton trucks, HMMWVs, and high- and super-high-frequency radios.

## Depot Maintenance

Funding levels under the proposed FY 2001 president's budget cover 77  percent  of  the  total  National  Guard  required  depot  maintenance. Requirements  for  early-deploying  divisions  and  the  enhanced  separate brigades are funded at 80 percent, for late-deploying units at 77 percent, and for other categories between 60 and 80 percent. Previous low levels of  funding  have  resulted  in  a  backlog  of  unserviceable  equipment  that still  requires support. The Guard unfunded FY 2000 depot maintenance requirement of $57.6 million was considerably higher than the FY 1998 figure of $39.0 million.

The Army Reserve depot maintenance program is funded at acceptable levels under the FY 2001 president' s budget for early-deploying units, aside from trucks. The Reserve' s main concern is providing more funding to latedeploying units and maintaining the tactical wheeled vehicle fleet. Unit readiness, while low in some late-deploying units, has been maintained at  efficient  levels  through  equipment  redistribution  and  funding  change implemented during program execution. The impact of unfunded depot maintenance is forecast to become severe in FY 2002 through FY 2007 if additional funding is not provided. The FY 2000 figure of $10.8 million is higher than the previous year ($4.6 million) but much lower than that for FY 1998 ($35.8 million).

## Organizational Maintenance

Because  units  are  unable  to  perform  routine  maintenance  on  all assigned  equipment,  both  the  National  Guard  and  Army  Reserve  use military  technicians  to  carry  out  what  would  otherwise  be  unit-level maintenance. Unfortunately, funding for the military technician program has  been  very  low  in  recent  years.  As  a  result,  both  the  Guard  and Reserve have identified additional funding for military technicians as a high priority. FY 2000 staffing levels at the Reserve' s Army Maintenance Support Activities and Equipment Concentration Sites were approximately 50 percent of requirements, creating a 4.6-million man-hour backlog for maintenance. This  includes  both A  and  B  services,  organizational,  and direct- and general-support maintenance. However, these figures generally

exclude  the  added  workload  incurred  as  preparation  for  annual  and overseas deployment training and support to contingency operations and military support to civil authorities. The Army validated both the Guard and Reserve requirements for additional military technicians in FY 2000 but did not expect to be able to allot them resources for the near future.

The  National  Guard  continued  to  support  several  initiatives  and programs  in  FY  2000  designed  to  slow  the  growth  in  organizational maintenance  backlogs  and  to  enhance  overall  maintenance  programs. Some  of  these  programs  include  velocity  management,  which  ensures that repair parts are readily available when needed; enhanced technician training, which provides training over and above that provided at Army schools; greater use and availability of modernized automated diagnostic systems on maintenance-intensive systems, such as the M1 Abrams and M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Systems; and storage of operational equipment in humidity and environmentally controlled shelters and devices to eliminate rust and deterioration.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

The  Army continued on its programs to employ automatic identification technology (AIT) in its efforts since 1990 to implement Army Total Asset Visibility (ATA V). ATA V is a comprehensive initiative intended to improve logisticians' ability to obtain and act on information about the location, quantity, condition, and movement of assets-over three million national stock numbers. In support of this initiative, AIT not only employs a variety of  data  storage  technologies  to  process  asset  identification  information, such  as  bar  codes,  magnetic  strips,  integrated  circuit  (or  smart)  cards, optical memory cards, contact-memory buttons, radio frequency identification devices, and magnetic storage media, but also encompasses the hardware and software required to populate the devices with data, read the information on them, and integrate that information with other logistics information. Having significant data storage capacities, the AIT devices can  range,  for  example,  from  a  single  part  number  to  a  self-contained database and can be interrogated using contact, laser, or radio frequency devices for updating status records with new data fed electronically into automated information systems (AIS), thus enabling total asset visibility capabilities along the entire logistical pipeline. When required, a business process server is used as an AIT -AIS interface; however, an objective is to merge process server functions into the automated information systems.

The AIT infrastructure consists of these AIT devices and supporting servers,  networks,  communications  links,  databases,  and  transportation and supply nodes through which tracked supplies and units move along the supply and deployment pipeline from factory to unit and from home base to theater deployment locations. Radio frequency technology is a form of AIT. It provides both stand-off content visibility and in-transit visibility of assets as they move through the transportation pipeline, as well as permits rapid  and  accurate  capture,  retrieval,  and  transmission  of  supply  and transportation data on container and pallet contents.

Forces  Command's power projection infrastructure  consists  of  power projection  platforms  and  selected  power  support  platforms  and  reserve power  projection  platforms.  These  are  instrumented  posts,  camps,  and

stations  and  their  supporting  transportation  nodes  and  ports  from  and through  which  designated  active  and  reserve  deploying  units  and  their required support packages flow from their home stations to their assigned deployment  locations  in  a  theater  of  operations.  Tagging  of  vehicles and  equipment  packages  enables  commanders  to  observe  and  track  unit movements  throughout  the  deployment  process.  Early-entry  deployment support (fly-away) kits are placed at selected critical locations to support power projections. Over the course of FY 2000-in partnership with Forces Command, U.S. Army, Europe, Pacific Command, and the Eighth Army/ U.S.  Forces,  Korea-the  Army  Logistics  Integration  Agency  performed site surveys of seven power support platforms. The agency also completed installations of radio frequency AIT at four power projection platforms; at Tooele, Bluegrass, and McAlester Ammunition Depots; at U.S. ports of Port Hadlock, Washington, and Bangor, Maine; and at eight Class I vendor sites.

Integration of ammunition AIT into the ammunition process provides source  data  automation,  enhancement  of  the  inventory  process,  and tracking of ammunition items from the wholesale level through critical transportation nodes to the ammunition supply point. With Army Materiel Command,  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  Pacific  Command,  Eighth  Army,  and Military Traffic Management Command, the Logistics Integration Agency implemented a pilot integration program for conventional ammunition at six sites in August 1998. Congressional funding since FY 1998 has been used to extend the effort to remaining Tier I ammunition depots, European ammunition supply points, and one U.S. port. Funding has also supported initial business process analysis for Tier II ammunition depots.

In partnership with the program manager  for Standard  Army Ammunition System-Modernization (SAAS-MOD), the Logistics Integration Agency is installing the AIT business process server as part of the global AIT architecture. Developed to provide a seamless interface between AIT and SAAS-MOD while exchanging data between ammunition supply  and  transportation  nodes  in  the  ammunition  logistical  pipeline, the  ammunition  AIT  business  process  server  provides  short-term  AIT translation functions for both retail and wholesale supply while follow-on Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A) systems are designed. At the end of FY 2000, the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS)-1 business  process  server  was  installed  at  prototype  sites  in  Europe  and Korea. Planning was under way with DoD and the Joint Staff to expand installation  to  Central  Command at Camp Doha, Kuwait, and Southern Command at Sato Cano, Honduras. The agency has worked with Military Traffic  Management Command to provide a similar capability with the Worldwide Ports System; as of the end of the fiscal year, the Worldwide Ports  System  business  process  server  has  been  installed  at  four  ports with future expansion as part of the modernization program. In addition,

the agency has worked with the SARSS program manager and Software Design Center at Fort Lee, Virginia, to effect a smooth transition to the GCSS-A supply module, and has signed a memorandum of agreement with the GCSS-A program manager to facilitate the smooth migration of the business process server into the GCSS-A environment.

Maintenance AIT  integration  will  improve  maintenance  productivity and effectiveness by making key maintenance information available to all participants in the repair process, enhancing overall logistical operations. Maintenance AIT  will  provide  information  on  what  is  broken,  the  parts required to repair, repair history, location of items, and expected arrival time. This effort builds on existing initiatives of the Army and the other services and industry, incorporates current international and NATO standards, and supports emerging operational and logistics doctrine. AIT will also provide connectivity and information related to such business processes as supply, transportation, and finance. As of the end of FY 2000, a pilot program is being  implemented  to  operationally  test  the  concept  at  these  locations: Aviation and Missile Command, Tank Automotive Command, and Corpus Christi Army Depot, Texas. If successful, the pilot program will be followed by Army-wide implementation of maintenance AIT.

## Sustainment

The  Army  Strategic  Mobility  Program  (ASMP),  which  addresses infrastructure  requirements  to  facilitate  movement  of  personnel  and equipment from U.S. bases to aerial or sea ports of embarkation, provides funding to enhance deployment capability of personnel, equipment, and sustaining supplies as well as an acquisition of essential rail equipment and  intermodal  containers  required  for  rapid  power  projection.  The program, developed after the Mobility Requirements Study of 1992 and was revalidated in FY 1995 as part of a bottom-up review update, helps to fulfill the Army' s Legacy Force mobility requirements to deploy 5 1 /3/.notdef divisions and their associated combat service support in seventy-five days.

As  of  the  end  of  FY  2000,  the ASMP  infrastructure  initiative  was programmed  for  completion  in  FY  2003.  In  FY  2000,  ASMP  funded various projects: airfield repairs at Forts Stewart and Campbell; rail repairs at Forts Bragg and Riley; work at the Military Ocean Terminal, Concord, California; extensive mobility-related military construction at Forts Hood, Sill, Bragg, Benning, Bliss, and Carson, as well as ammunition facilities at  McAlester  Army  Ammunition  Plant;  Blue  Grass,  Letterkenny,  and Hawthorne Army Depots; and the Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point, North Carolina.

The Army Pre-positioned Stocks (APS) program includes equipment for seven armored brigades plus higher-echelon combat support and combat

service support unit sets with supporting ammunition and supplies. This equipment is divided into five elements assigned to the various geographic theaters. The War Reserve Division, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, works closely with the renamed Field Support Command, the service component commands, and the unified combatant commands to  develop  policy  and  programs  that  are  integrated  and  support  power projection using the APS program in concert with arriving forces to build combat power in the theater. In FY 2000, the Army War Reserve Support Command became the Field Support Command to reflect its wider missions beyond operation of the APS program, including logistical assistance.

In FY 2000, APS-1, United States, consisted primarily of operational projects  (equipment  available  to  support  combat  operations  and  other contingencies in addition to authorizations for modified table of organization and equipment and table of distribution and allowances) and sustainment stocks pre-positioned in the United States due to strategic lift considerations or awaiting shipment to overseas forward locations. One example  is  the  Inland  Pipeline  Distribution  System  operational  project stored at Sierra Army Depot in California. During FY 2000, a twenty-mile segment of this project was prepared and shipped to a storage location in Qatar.

APS-2, Europe, included equipment brigade sets in Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in FY 2000, plus a battalion of 155-mm. selfpropelled howitzers maintained in Norway as part of the NATO Composite Force. The  Kosovo  Force  and  Stabilization  Force  have  used  equipment from APS-2 to support ongoing operations. At the conclusion of equipment issues for Kosovo operations, APS-2 Brigade Set 1 (Luxembourg) had 72 percent of its authorized equipment on hand, Brigade Set 2 (Netherlands) had 84 percent, and Brigade Set 3 (Italy) had 56 percent.

The APS-3  Pre-positioning  Program  continues  toward  its  end  state of  fifteen  ships,  with  six  ships  loaded  with APS-3  cargo.  Several  ships underwent maintenance cycles,  including  two  lighter  aboard  ships,  one container ship, and one heavy-lift pre-positioning ship. The program has begun moving its stocks from converted LMSR ships to new construction LMSRs.  Six  LMSRs  conducted  cargo  operations  at  Charleston,  South Carolina. In addition, three LMSRs in Charleston and in Europe loaded up with combat support and combat service support sustainment cargo. A plan to load munitions from three lighter aboard ships to two newly acquired container ships was to begin in October 2000 as of the end of FY 2000.

In  FY  2000,  APS-4,  the  Pacific  pre-positioned  stocks,  consisted of an armored brigade set stored at Camp Carroll, Korea, in controlled humidity warehouses. Both Camp Carroll and the Sagami Depot in Japan held additional operational project stocks for such missions as base camp

preparation, river crossing, and hospitals but also war sustainment stocks. The APS-4 brigade set fill reached 96 percent in FY 2000.

Army  planners  calculate  supply  levels  of  war  reserve  secondary items for sustainment based on 45 days' consumption. As of the end of FY 2000, items in Supply Class I (rations) were at 97 percent; Class II (clothing), at 63 percent; Class IIIP (packaged lubricants), at 14 percent; Class IV (construction materiel), at 78 percent; Class VIII (medical), at 49 percent; and Class IX (repair parts), at 15 percent. The FY 2000 level of supply Class VII (major equipment) items intended to replace equipment destroyed in combat is 50 percent in theater. This figure, however, includes 4,100 protective masks; without these, the percent fill is 24 percent, with all of the tanks, fighting vehicles, and howitzers missing.

APS-5, headquartered at Qatar, encompasses the Army pre-positioned stocks in Southwest Asia. In FY 2000, major components of APS-5 were at two locations: Combat Equipment Base (CEB)-Kuwait held two armored brigade sets, while CEB-Qatar had one armored brigade set in place with plans to accommodate division base unit sets under way. Additional APS stocks  are  stored  in  Bahrain  and  Oman.  Control  of  CEB-Kuwait  moved from Army Central Command to Army Materiel Command at the beginning of FY 2000; operational control and base operations responsibilities remain with Army Central Command. APS-4 was 94 percent complete in FY 2000.

APS is strongly coupled with strategic sealift. Based on the bottom-up review update of the Mobility Requirements Study, the Army has strategic sealift requirements for nineteen LMSRs, thirty-one roll-on/roll-off ships, eight fast sealift ships, six crane ships, two heavy-lift pre-positioning ships, three  lighter  aboard  ships,  and  two  container  ships. These  ships  enable deployment of a 5 1 /3/.notdefdivision contingency force within seventy-five days. The 106th Congress appropriated one extra LMSR to fulfill Marine Corps requirements.  The  LMSR  program  involves  acquisition  of  fifteen  new construction ships and conversion of five ships for a total of twenty ships. LMSRs are much larger and more efficient than current Ready Reserve Force roll-on/roll-off vessels. Four of the five conversion LMSRs are in service  as  part  of  the  Navy  surge  sealift  program. The  fifth  conversion LMSR has been turned over to the Marine Corps.

As of the end of FY 2000, eight of the fifteen new construction LMSRs had been delivered. Six are loaded with APS-3 cargo in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Two of the new construction LMSRs are also part of the surge program. Of the fifteen new construction LMSRs, eight are planned to support the Pre-positioning Program by FY 2003. At completion of the LMSR acquisition program, the Navy will have four conversion LMSRs and seven new construction LMSRs in the surge sealift program.

More than ninety percent of the materials required to sustain operating forces moves by strategic sealift. U.S. Army watercraft, the key elements

in the logistical support of power projection, provide the means to transfer that cargo from strategic sealift ships to the shore. The transfer of cargo from strategic sealift ships, anchored offshore and in open waters, to the shore  is  known  as  logistics-over-the-shore  (LOTS)  operations.  LOTS operations are conducted to ensure that strategic sealift can be off-loaded when fixed ports are inadequate, unavailable, or denied by enemy action. Joint LOTS operations are conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Navy.

As of the end of FY 2000, the Army watercraft inventory consisted of 270 pieces of equipment, including logistical support vessels, landing craft, causeway systems, and various other utility craft such as tugboats, floating  cranes,  and  barges.  As  part  of  the  Army  Strategic  Mobility Program, the Army has loaded watercraft aboard three ships of the APS-3 fleet. Collectively, these watercraft units are known as the port opening package. In FY 2000, the Army began an ambitious plan to restructure its watercraft fleet to create a globally responsive, modernized, forward stationed,  and  forward  positioned  fleet  operable  in  up  to  Sea  State  3 (three- to five-foot waves). The Army's watercraft program will increase reserve component participation through activation of multicomponent watercraft  units;  however,  the  port  opening  package  lacks  sufficient roll-on/roll-off discharge facilities. The Army thus plans to address this shortfall by investment in such sea-state moderating technologies as the Joint  Modular Lighter System, which addresses the Defense Planning Guidance  requirement  for  Sea  State  3  LOTS  capability  and  reduces reliance on improved ports and maritime infrastructure.

## Security Assistance

The  Army  in  FY  2000  had  one  of  its  most  productive  years  for security  assistance  since  the  Persian  Gulf War,  completing  $4.2  billion in foreign military sales and reviewing commercial license requests with the potential to generate over $10 billion in direct commercial sales. The secretary  of  the  Army  delegated  responsibility  for  policy  oversight  of the Army's export-control elements to the deputy under secretary of the Army for international affairs. The secretary' s decision reflected the fact that foreign disclosure and the release of Army-managed technology had become the central focus of all Army major weapon sales programs. The delegation  of  oversight  included  the  foreign  disclosure  and  technology transfer responsibilities exercised by the assistant secretary of the Army for  acquisition,  logistics,  and  technology;  the  deputy  chief  of  staff  for intelligence; and the Army Materiel Command.

In addition to its role in foreign military sales, the Army participated in  a  variety  of  international  armaments  cooperation  initiatives.  For  FY 2000, the Army processed over two hundred actions to develop, negotiate,

and  conclude  international  agreements. These  actions  resulted  in  three memorandums of understanding  one project agreement, ten data exchange , agreements,  and  four  loans.  The  Armaments  Cooperation  Directorate, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the  Army for Security Cooperation, was particularly involved in securing medium armored tactical vehicles from international  partners  for  the  initial  brigade  at  Fort  Lewis  for  the purpose  of  developing  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  and  refining doctrine  for  the  new  brigade  concept. The  loan  agreements  took  place under authority provided in Section 65 of the Arms Export Control Act to loan or borrow military equipment for research, development, test, and evaluation  purposes. These  agreements  provided  the Army  with  insight into foreign technologies and lines of research. In addition, the Armaments Cooperation Program forged greater ties between the United States and other nations.

## European Command

In European Command, the Army's major international sales competition  centered  on  the  M1A2  tank  and  the  Army' s  assistance  to General  Dynamics  in  developing  a  competitive  proposal  for  the  Greek commercial  solicitation  to  procure  246  armored  systems.  The  major competitor for the sale was the German Leopard II. The Army teamed with General Dynamics to enhance U.S. competitiveness by offering Greece an interim lease on eighty-five M1A1 tanks, contingent upon the purchase of the M1A2. The low-cost lease was a critical component of the U.S. offer, countering a low- or no-cost lease of Leopards by the Germans. The Army requested that the secretary of defense waive the rental charges for the tanks and other equipment that had exceeded 75 percent of their useful life, as permitted under current legislation. Greece was expected to make a decision on its tank purchase in spring 2001. Congress was expected to support the sale due to the work generated for U.S. companies throughout the country and for Watervliet and Rock Island Arsenals.

In February 2000, Israel signed an agreement to upgrade twelve AH64A Apache attack helicopters to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. Valued at $276 million, the agreement included the fire control radar, radar frequency  interferometer,  and  480  Longbow  HELLFIRE  missiles.  U.S. refusal to release Longbow software source code remained a major issue even after the Israeli signature. The Israelis continued to pursue a favorable release  decision,  which  would  permit  their  integration  of  nonstandard subsystems on the platform.

Another Longbow-related development took place on 22 May 2000, when representatives of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense signed a memorandum of understanding

to  create  a  framework  for  future  cooperative  project  arrangements  for development of the Apache aircraft and subsystems. The memorandum allows  for  the  placement  of  a  British  officer  within  the Apache  project office  under  a  Cooperative  Personnel  Program Arrangement. A  similar common  missile  memorandum  was  initiated  in  FY  2000  to  design, develop, and produce a modern antimateriel antiarmor missile that can be launched from current and future ground and aerial platforms, initially the Longbow Apache.

Armaments cooperation activity with Sweden accelerated in FY 2000 based  on  a  Senior  National  Representative  (Army)  review  conducted  in Sweden on 18 February 2000. The Trajectory Correctable Munitions Project Arrangement continues to be a successful cooperative program with Sweden. This  program  seeks  to  develop  an  extended  range  precision-guided  155mm. artillery projectile. In September 2000, an amendment to the Munitions Project Arrangement increased the scope and length of the program.

## Pacific Command

In Pacific Command,  the  Army  faced  unique  and  challenging requirements as the countries in the region quickly surpassed those in the Middle East as the Army' s largest foreign military sales (FMS) base. These activities included supporting a presidential-directed emergency drawdown of Army materiel  for  East Timor,  hosting  the  first  distinguished  visitor orientation tour for senior officials from Cambodia, and participating in the Asian Aerospace exhibition in Singapore.

The most notable Army FMS action in Pacific Command, however, was the Singapore Apache Longbow Program. As a condition of sale for eight Apache Longbow helicopters, the Singapore government requested that the aircraft be based in the United States until December 2007. Since September 1999, Singapore had been expecting to base the aircraft at Fort Hood, Texas,  but  in  November  2000,  the Army  chief  of  staff  informed Singapore's chief of defense that Singapore' s Apaches would be based at Marana, Arizona. Initially, Singapore was disappointed with this decision, but quickly appreciated the better training areas and quality of life available at the Arizona site. The Singapore Apaches will be colocated at Marana with the 1st Battalion, 285th Aviation (Attack), which is equipped with older AH-64As. Singapore expressed concern about its ability to train on Longbow-specific tasks until Army representatives briefed senior officials on the collective training plan being developed for the Singapore Longbow force by the 21st Cavalry Brigade.

During  FY  2000,  other  major  Army  FMS  activities  in  Pacific Command included the sale of six CH-47 Chinook helicopters to Taiwan ($434 million), an MLRS battalion to Korea ($366 million), two Black

Hawk helicopters to Thailand ($30 million), and five excess Army UH-1H helicopters to the Philippines ($4 million).

The Pacific Command areawitnessed increased armaments cooperation activity in FY 2000, including agreements between the United States and the  governments  of  Japan,  Singapore,  and  Australia.  The  twenty-first meeting of the U.S.-Japan Systems and Technology Forum took place on 13 January 2000 in Tokyo, Japan. During this meeting, subject-matter experts discussed a variety of subjects, including ducted rocket engines, fighting vehicle propulsion technology using ceramic materials, the Cooperative Eye-Safe  Laser Radar  Program,  low-vulnerability ammunition,  and other  U.S.-Japan  data  exchanges. Armaments  cooperation  activity  with Singapore increased dramatically during FY 2000. The first SingaporeU.S. Defense Cooperation Committee meeting took place at the Pentagon on 25 April 2000. The meeting led to an agreement between the services to  initiate  a  forum  for  armaments cooperation. It was expected that the inaugural Senior National Representative (Army) forum would be held in December 2000. A similar forum was also held in Australia in FY 2000.

## Southern Command

During FY 2000, the Army's security assistance efforts in Southern Command focused on the implementation of Plan Colombia, a program that assists the Colombian government in combating narcotics trafficking. In August 2000, Congress approved $1.3 billion in supplemental funding, of  which $208 million was reserved for the purchase of up to fourteen Black  Hawk  helicopters  for  the  Colombian Army,  $26  million  for  the purchase  of  two  Black  Hawks  for  the  Colombian  National  Police,  and $13.2  million  for  aviation  infrastructure  requirements.  The  Office  of the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Army  (International  Affairs)  was responsible  for  overseeing  the  overall  acquisition,  fielding,  training, and follow-on logistics requirements, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers infrastructure development program. Throughout the acquisition and fielding, the Army, through the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary (International  Affairs),  worked  to  maintain  solid  relations  with  Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela, which had grown increasingly concerned over the growing U.S. involvement in Colombia.

The Southern Command  area of responsibility provided two opportunities  for  the  Army  to  further  extend  its  cooperative  programs for research and development. During 2000, one new proposal for a data exchange annex with Argentina was created, which continued the trend of greater engagement between the United States and this region. Efforts to  expand  the  U.S.  ability  to  benefit  from  collaborative  research  and development materialized with the successful meeting of the Technology

and  Logistics  team  of  the  U.S.-Argentina  Science  Bilateral  Working Group  in  Buenos  Aires,  Argentina,  in  August  2000.  The  Army  took actions  regarding  areas  of  interest  for  potential  information  exchange. The  annual  meeting  served  to  enhance  cooperation  between  the  two defense establishments. In addition to discussing a draft of the proposed blood product safety information exchange annex, the Army planned to assess  the  potential  for  developing  an  information  exchange  annex  for artillery weapons systems. Additional topics discussed included a possible amendment to the master information exchange agreement to allow for the exchange of classified information.

A  U.S.-Chile  Science  and  Technology  Committee  annual  meeting occurred  in  Santiago,  Chile,  in  August  2000.  Resumed  after  a  lull  of twenty-five years, the meeting was an important step in strengthening and enhancing cooperation between the two defense establishments. It resulted in the decision to draft a master information exchange agreement between the Department of Defense and the Chilean Ministry of Defense to facilitate an  information  exchange  between  the  U.S.  and  Chilean  armed  forces. Chile expressed an interest in signing a memorandum of understanding for an engineer and scientist exchange program to facilitate the placement of  Chilean  scientists  and  engineers  in  U.S.  military  laboratories  and installations.  Army issues discussed included clarification of Chilean Army interests  in  telecommunications,  battlefield  reconnaissance  operations, and simulation software development and upgrades.

## Central Command

FY  2000  saw  a  decline  in  new  major  weapons  sales  in  Central Command's  area  of  responsibility;  however,  sustainment  programs  for previously procured systems remained strong. In addition, the Army faced several challenges in the region as some countries began to play a more active  role  in  coalition  operations  outside  the  region,  and  U.S.  foreign policy objectives sought to facilitate change in old regimes.

One challenge was the Army's support to the Iraqi National Congress. In October 1999, Presidential Determination 2000-5 directed the Department of Defense to draw down equipment and provide services in support  of  the  Iraqi  Liberation Act  of  1998. The  act,  which  designated the Iraqi National Congress as the recipient of the initial allocations, was not only to create a viable, effective external Iraqi political opposition for demonstrating  to  the  Iraqi  people  that  alternatives  to  Saddam  Hussein exist  but  also  to  help  alleviate  the  humanitarian  conditions  faced  by Iraqis  both  inside  and  outside  Iraq.  Presidential  Determination  2000-5 provided up to $5 million in defense materiel and services, along with military education and training, for the act. Because Iraqi students selected

to  attend  U.S.  training  were  living  in  a  number  of  countries  around  the world, third-country security assistance offices had to assist with student processing. Thus,  in  support  of  the  drawdown,  the Army  and  the  other armed services established nonlethal training programs that are based on Iraqi National Congress requirements. Types of training include preventive medicine specialist, medical specialist, medical supply specialist, patient administration, journalism, photojournalism, and Web page design. The services  absorbed  the  cost  of  the  training  courses  and,  in  some  cases, the  cost  of  the  student  housing,  meals,  and  travel  under  the  drawdown authority.

Experience with the United  Arab Emirates (UAE)  forces in Kosovo participating in Task Force eagle in  FY  2000  highlighted the importance of interoperability. Since late 1999, the UAE had deployed six Apache helicopters to Kosovo. In the summer of 2000, a new U.S. Army Apache unit rotated into theater to discover that the UAE aircraft could not communicate in a secure mode using their organic radios and encryption devices. The Army's security-assistance community resolved the situation by preparing a foreign military sales case to lease Armystandard  AN/ARC-201C  radios  to  the  UAE.  While  the  radios  were leased, the case required the UAE to purchase and install modification kits to accommodate the integration.

Qatar,  whose  strategic  location  and  bilateral  defense  cooperation agreements provide U.S. access to bases and allow pre-positioning of stocks, requested  a  briefing  on  the  Patriot  Advanced  Capability-3  (P AC-3)  air defense missile system. An Army-Raytheon team deployed to brief senior Qatar  officials,  and  the  detailed  presentation  was  expected  to  generate  a letter of request to procure an undetermined number of PAC-3 sets.

Bahrain  accepted  a  foreign  military  sales  case  for  the  purchase  of thirty ATACMS Block I Export missiles and support. This was a highprofile program, as it was the first release of ATACMS in the region. The program was valued at  $47  million,  including  thirty ATACMS  Block  I Export missiles and associated support, along with fifty-seven extendedrange MLRS pods.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

Army  research,  development,  and  acquisition  in  FY  2000  focused on the desire to transform the force by taking advantage of technological advances, tempered by the realization that any transformation would be a  long-term process conducted in the face of immediate needs. Efforts, therefore, have proceeded along three axes. The first is the improvement, recapitalization, and maintenance of the Legacy Force. The second is the development of an Interim Force to test new organization and equipment

on available platforms. The third is developing the science and technology needed to create the Objective Force.

One major Legacy Force effort is to use emerging digital communications  systems  to  improve  command  and  control . The Army Battle  Command  System,  for  example,  incorporates  a  variety  of  new information  technologies  and  offers  commanders  at  all  levels  greater situational awareness and therefore the ability to make faster decisions. It functions as a subset of the DoD Global Command and Control System. At the highest Army command levels, the system incorporates the Global Command  and  Control  System-Army  (GCCS-A),  the  Army's  strategic and theater command and control system; at the end of FY 2000, U.S. Army,  Europe,  Pacific  Command,  Southern  Command,  Army  Central Command, Forces Command, and Headquarters, Department of the Army, plus  Combined  Forces  Command,  Korea,  had  implemented  GCCS-A. Two other capabilities, the Maneuver Control System and the  Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-Below system, which continued in limited production during FY 2000, provide a common operating picture at lower levels of command for ground forces. The aviation analog of these systems, the Army Airborne Command and Control System was under development in FY 2000. Air defense is coordinated by the Forward Area Air Defense Command  and  Control  system,  which  had  equipped  ten  divisions,  an armored cavalry regiment, and a National Guard Avenger light antiaircraft missile  battalion  by  the  end  of  FY  2000.  Lastly,  fire-support  data  is handled by the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). Based on nondevelopmental (off-the-shelf or developed but not fielded) hardware, AFATDS underwent a software upgrade early in FY 2000 with an additional upgrade passing integration and confidence testing later in the fiscal year.

Subsystems of the Battle Command System integrate combat support and combat service support information systems. The All Source Analysis System  (ASAS)  integrates  intelligence  data  from  national,  theater,  and tactical sources, with ASAS Block I fielded to the entire Army as of the end of the fiscal year. Topographic information is handled by the Digital Topographic Support System, which achieved first-unit-equipped status in FY 2000 with the fielding of five systems to the 4th Infantry Division at the end of August 2000. Combat service support information is controlled by the Combat Service Support Control System, which in FY 2000 was extended from a divisional system to one serving echelons above corps. Weather information is handled by the Integrated Meteorological System, with twenty-seven Block II vehicle-mounted systems in service by the end of the fiscal year.

One  benefit  of  the  increased  situational  awareness  expected  from enhanced command and control systems is increased scope for non-line-

of-sight  fires.  This  increased  scope  is  complemented  by  programs  to increase the effectiveness of such fires. The most important Army artillery program in FY 2000 was the Crusader 155-mm. self-propelled howitzer system,  which  promised  to  greatly  increase  the  range  and  lethality  of direct-support fire in heavy formations; the first prototype howitzer vehicle was delivered in the second quarter of the fiscal year. The Excalibur family of  precision-guided  artillery  projectiles  under  development  will  further enhance the effectiveness of the Crusader system, as well as the planned XM777 lightweight 155-mm. howitzer and other 155-mm. howitzers in the Army inventory.

In addition to tube artillery, the Army continued to improve its rocket artillery programs. These efforts included a variety of enhancements to the MLRS, including the Guided MLRS, which uses global positioning system navigation and a new motor to double the original range of the system, and the  High-Mobility Artillery  Rocket  System  (HIMARS),  which  mounts  a single MLRS pod on a family of medium tactical vehicles truck to extend MLRS capability to light units. HIMARS, like the original tracked M270 MLRS launch vehicle, can also employ the larger Army Tactical Missile System  (ATACMS)  that  has  been  the  subject  of  other  improvement programs. ATACMS Block II, which incorporates the BAT precision-guided submunition,  completed  developmental  testing  in  FY  2000.  A  productimproved BAT, capable of engaging a wider variety of targets and slated to arm ATACMS Block IIA, underwent captive-flight testing.

Systems improving the ability of maneuver units to acquire targets and call for fires were another focus for Legacy Force research, development, and acquisition activity in FY 2000. The M7 Bradley fire-support team vehicle  was  in  full  production,  with  a  successor  version,  incorporating the  capabilities  of  the  M2/3A3  Bradley,  in  development. It  gave  laserdesignation  and  night-vision  capabilities  to  company,  battalion,  and brigade  fire-support  teams  in  heavy  units.  The  entry  of  the  lighter HMMWV-based M707 Striker into full production, in addition, provided these capabilities to a wider range of units, including combat observation lasing teams, brigade reconnaissance troops, and scout platoons, in both heavy  and  light  forces.  The  Long-Range Advanced  Scout  Surveillance System, which completed limited user testing at the end of FY 2000, is expected to provide further enhanced sensor capabilities, especially longer detection ranges, in both HMMWV-borne and dismounted use. Another increase in target acquisition range at the brigade level will accrue from the introduction of the tactical unmanned aerial vehicle, which underwent flight-testing in FY 2000.

The major Legacy Force close combat weapons systems programs, the M1 Abrams tank and the M2 and M3 Bradley fighting vehicles, had less radical progress in FY 2000, continuing the improvement programs of

previous fiscal years. The Army deleted funding for one M1 variant, the Grizzly combat engineer vehicle, from its FY 2001 budget submission. A new focus of close combat development was the Land Warrior ensemble, designed to bring the benefits of digitization to the individual dismounted soldier with a minimal increase in the weight and complexity of personal equipment. A test platoon at Fort Bragg received prototype Land Warrior systems,  and  after  training  the  platoon  successfully  participated  in  the Joint Contingency Force Advanced Warfighting Experiment at Fort Polk late in the fiscal year.

The  Army devoted considerable research, development, and acquisition effort  to  close  combat  missile  systems in FY 2000. The Army awarded a  four-year  contract  for  11,805  Javelin  medium  antiarmor  missiles  and 2,968 of their associated command launch units. As the Army moved into Javelin acquisition, it also devoted development effort to the older, heavier TOW antiarmor missile. These projects included the TOW Improved Target Acquisition System, a sensor and fire-control upgrade, which was fielded to 3d Brigade, 82d Airborne Division, during the first half of the fiscal year. TOW fire and forget, a further TOW development with an autonomous imaging-infrared  guidance  system  similar  to  that  of  Javelin,  entered engineering and manufacturing development late in FY 2000. The lineof-sight antitank hypervelocity missile, an even heavier antiarmor missile, had its development program accelerated by two years. Its use of kinetic energy to destroy targets and its associated high closing velocity provide a  hedge  against  expected  developments  in  active  defenses  for  armored vehicles that could reduce or even negate the effectiveness of traditional slower antiarmor missiles employing chemical-energy warheads.

The Army conducted several aviation modernization projects in FY 2000. The program with the highest priority was the Comanche armed reconnaissance  helicopter,  which  the  Defense  Acquisition  Executive approved for engineering and manufacturing development in April 2000. During the year, the two Comanche prototypes continued flight testing, completing full expansion of the flight-test envelope. While conducting Comanche  development,  the  Army  continued  to  modernize  its  older helicopters and signed a five-year contract with Boeing to remanufacture 269 Apaches AH-64D Longbows at the end of the fiscal year. In another remanufacturing initiative,  engineering  and  manufacturing  development continued on the CH-47F Chinook medium-lift helicopter, a program to improve the airframes, engines, and avionics of most of the existing CH47D fleet with the expectation of extending the useful life of the aircraft another twenty years.

The  major  platform  for  the  six  brigades  of  the  projected  Interim Force will be the interim armored vehicle, a light armored vehicle to be based on an existing system, but small and light enough to fly in a C-130

medium transport aircraft. Two versions are planned, an infantry carrier vehicle and a mobile gun system. The infantry carrier vehicle, in turn, will have eight derivatives: a mortar carrier, a TOW-armed antitank vehicle, a reconnaissance vehicle, a fire-support vehicle, an engineer squad vehicle, a command vehicle, a medical evacuation vehicle, and an NBC (nuclear, biological,  and  chemical)  reconnaissance  vehicle.  The  Army  and  the Office of the Secretary of Defense approved the final request for proposals in April 2000 and received proposals and bid samples two months later, and as of the end of FY 2000, expected to decide on a contractor early the next year to supply 2,131 interim armored vehicles of all types. As a result, the  Interim  Force  will  enjoy  enhanced  mobility  and  reduced  logistical footprint, and most importantly, use of networked, integrated, and digitized information from the widest variety of sources.

The centerpiece of the Objective Force is the FCS Program, which will build off the experience of the modernized Legacy Force and the Interim Force  to  produce  a  mobile,  survivable,  and  lethal  family  of  weapons systems  designed  from  the  beginning  to  incorporate  advanced  digital command and  control  systems  (in  contrast  to  the  older  systems  added onto the earlier forces). The program will include a family of manned light armored vehicles analogous to those of the Interim Force, plus a range of unmanned ground and air vehicles. Both manned and unmanned elements will  employ  advanced  weapon,  sensor,  and  communication  systems.  In May 2000, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded four FCS design and concept-definition contracts.

## Testing

In November  1998,  the  vice  chief of staff had approved  the consolidation of developmental and operational testing. This decision was put  into  action  on  1  October  1999,  when  the  newly  created Army Test and  Evaluation  Command,  in  Alexandria,  Virginia,  was  given  overall responsibility  for  all  Army  developmental  and  operational  testing.  As part of this consolidation, the new command oversaw three subordinate organizations: the Test and Evaluation Command, renamed the U.S. Army Developmental Test Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; the  Test  and  Experimentation  Command,  also  renamed  the  U.S.  Army Operational Test Command at Fort Hood, Texas; and the new U.S. Army Evaluation Center in Alexandria, Virginia, by combining the Operational Evaluation Command and the Evaluation Analysis Center.

The  Army  Test  and  Evaluation  Command  continued  to  support the Army's  Force  XXI  modernization  efforts  by  testing  and  evaluating weapons systems and digital technologies, including the digitized M2A3 Bradley fighting vehicle, the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade-and-

Below system, Patriot Advanced Capability-3, Comanche helicopter, the Strategic Sealift Program, and the Joint STARS Common Ground Station. In addition, it tested and evaluated the interim armored vehicle projected to equip the Interim Force. The command tested medium-weight armored vehicles  from  seven  countries  during  the  Army-sponsored  platform performance demonstration at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in early 2000; began evaluating  manufacturers'  bid  samples  for  infantry  carrier  vehicles  at several test centers to determine their safety, performance, and endurance characteristics in June 2000; and, while the Army evaluated the test data, conducted safety verification on similar medium-weight armored vehicles (on loan from Germany and Italy) so initial brigade combat teams at Fort Lewis, Washington, could train and develop doctrine and tactics until the interim  armored  vehicle  was  fielded.  Following  contract  award  for  the family of vehicles, the command will be involved in developmental and operational testing at various test centers.

Modeling and simulation became a powerful tool that the Army Test and Evaluation Command employed to understand the military utility and limitations of systems during both developmental and operational testing. Models  used  existing  system  characteristics  and  missions  to  predict responses, which then were validated with physical testing. The command also implemented simulation-based acquisition and the Army' s simulation and  modeling  for  acquisition,  requirements,  and  training  (SMART) concepts.  Through  the  resulting  virtual  proving  ground  initiative,  new test technologies cut costs by reducing test scope, lowering prototype and manpower requirements, and integrating the model-test-model process so that design changes could be made earlier with less expense.

## Support Services

Health and Medical Programs

The Medical Reengineering Initiative (MRI), begun in October 1993 with the objective of reorganizing the Army' s medical force at echelons above division to support the Army's vision and Force XXI patterns of operations  while  correcting  deficiencies  noted  in  the  Persian  Gulf War, provides far-forward medical  treatment, including advanced  trauma management and far-forward surgery, and employs standardized medical units using a modular medical support system for improved deployability. The initiative is a program focused on converting the entire combat health support  units  of  the Army  Medical  Department  (AMEDD)  at  echelons above  division  and  is  not  an  equipment  modernization  effort.  Ongoing equipment  modernization  and  recapitalization  of  the  combat  health support units in Force Packages 1 and 2 will occur simultaneously with the MRI conversion process. The planned MRI force consists of 391 units.

MRI  implementation  commenced  with  the  inactivation  of  medical units in FY 1998, which provided equipment to FY 2000 MRI units. After extensive  cost  analysis  and  coordination  with  the  major  commands  on the availability of current assets, the first 6 MRI units were converted (or inactivated) in October 1999 and 3 more in September 2000, with another 25 planned for FY 2001. Only 165 of the 391 MRI units are scheduled for conversion (or activation) by the end of FY 2006, with the remaining units currently  unfunded.  The  initial  phase  of  MRI  implementation  focuses on the medical units supporting the first Digitized Corps; selected Army pre-positioned medical sets; and the forward stationed medical units in Europe and Korea, whose operational tempo requires the modular MRI organizations.

On 1 October 2001, the new MOS 91W, health care specialist, will merge  MOS  91B  (medical  specialist)  and  91C  (practical  nurse).  The 91W initiative, begun in 1998, will produce highly skilled and competent medics knowledgeable in force health protection and basic primary care skills as well as skilled in evacuation and extraction. Unlike before, the Army will require 91W soldiers to maintain emergency medical technician B  certification. AMEDD's  new  Department  of  Combat  Medic Training

will have over four hundred personnel assigned to train 91W soldiers. The department will conduct initial entry training and advanced training for noncommissioned  officers  and  offer  continuing  education  courses. The sixteen-week course will include didactic and practical exercise. Medical specialists  will  train  not  only  in  the  field  environment  but  also  in  the clinical environment with rotations through Brooke Army Medical Center Clinics. The  course  may  be  extended  to  allow  instructors  to  train  91W soldiers to standard and not to familiarization, as is presently the case. As of the end of FY 2000, the Department of Combat Medic Training was on track to open on 1 October 2001.

Also at the beginning of FY 2001, all soldiers in MOS 91B and 91C are scheduled for reclassification to MOS 91W Y2, where Y2 designates a fully MOS-qualified soldier in transition. Soldiers who are eligible for promotion to sergeant first class or above on or before 1 October 2001 will be grandfathered and have the Y2 additional skill identifier removed by the personnel system. All other soldiers must meet the transition training requirements to become fully qualified in MOS 91W . As of the end of FY 2000, the transition period for active-component soldiers is 1 October 2001  to  30  September  2007;  reserve-component  soldiers  have  from  1 October 2001 to 30 September 2009.

AMEDD must have an integrated automated system to streamline the collection, processing, storage, and transmission of medical information in a theater of operations to support the digitized Army. In this role, the Medical Communication for Combat Casualty Care (MC4) system will be used to modernize, digitize, and integrate medical information. MC4 capability will enable combat health support personnel at all echelons to digitally  exchange data, including text, audio, and video. Integration of existing  and  emerging  information  technologies  into  the  combat  health support and patient care systems, beginning with the individual soldier and  continuing  through  all  elements  of  the  military  healthcare  system, will allow AMEDD to project the expert care necessary to sustain future forces. Components of MC4 include the nonmedical equipment associated with the Medical Detachment, Telemedicine; communications equipment, such as the future small extension node; warfighter physiological status monitor; the personal information carrier, a small flash-memory device to  be  carried  by  every  soldier;  and  computers  ranging  from  personally carried, to vehicle-mounted, to laptop or desktop; and file servers. Initial efforts  will  focus  on  the  personally  carried/voice-activated  computers, vehicle-mounted computers, and the personnel information carrier.

The  MC4  program  timeline  is  closely  tied  to  that  of  the  Theater Medical Information Program, which will employ a three-block incremental  development  approach.  Initial  operating  capability  will  be realized with the fielding of MC4 to III Corps, to occur in two phases.

The first phase was Block I fielding to the 4th Infantry Division and other selected III Corps units in FY 2000, allowing these units to participate in the Digitized Division Capstone Exercise scheduled for FY 2001. The second phase will be Block I fielding to the remaining III Corps units. Full operating capability will be achieved by FY 2010 with the fielding of all three MC4 system blocks to all medical force structure units. As of the end of FY 2000, the estimated life-cycle cost of MC4 through FY 2020 is $626.1 million, exclusive of operation and support. Training and Doctrine Command approved the MC4 operational requirements document on 19 November 1999.

The Army had several projects in hand to improve medical evacuation in FY 2000. The armored medical vehicle, derived from the Bradley fighting vehicle,  is  intended  to  replace  the  1960s-vintage  M113-series  armored medical vehicles as the primary medical evacuation and treatment platforms for the heavy force. Experience in Operation Desert shielD revealed that the M113-series lacks the maneuverability, speed, and survivability required for the heavy force. Recapitalizing excess depot M2A0 Bradleys and thus eliminating  repair  parts  support  to  the  displaced  M113-series  vehicles, the medical vehicle will enhance medical capability by carrying onboard oxygen supply, vital signs monitoring, storage of essential medical items and equipment, and the same information systems as the digitized forces it supports. It reached a successful Milestone I/II decision on 11 May 1999 and  has  been  designated  the  XM11  turretless  Bradley  armored  medical evacuation vehicle. However, the vehicle is an unfinanced requirement as of the end of FY 2000, primarily because of the Department of Defense inspector general' s recommendation to terminate the program based on the absence of procurement funding. An analogous vehicle, the interim armored vehicle/medical evacuation vehicle is planned for the interim brigade combat teams, using the interim armored vehicle chassis. As of the end of FY 2000, projected force designs called for seventeen medical evacuation vehicles in each interim brigade combat team.

Life Support for Trauma and Transport (LSTAT) is a single-patient intensive-care device to maintain life support and stabilization of critical battlefield  casualties  during  evacuation.  The  system,  which  contains  a defibrillator, ventilator, electrocardiogram machine, fluid infusion pump, surgical suction unit, and self-contained oxygen supply, is less than 1 foot deep and as long and wide as a standard U.S. military litter. At the request of The Surgeon General, an LSTAT was deployed in early April 2000 for ground operational use in Kosovo. An important developmental goal for the system is weight reduction. The current LSTAT version weighs 175 pounds. Army doctrine calls  for  a  320-pound  weight  limit  for  the  load carried by a team of four litter-bearers, a limit that would be exceeded by any casualty over 145 pounds in LSTAT's current state.

## Army Chaplaincy

The  Army  chief  of  staff  directed  the  establishment,  effective  1 November 1999, of the Directorate of Ministry Initiatives in the Office of the Chief of Chaplains to address shortages in faith group representation in the chaplaincy. In FY 2000, although 25 percent of soldiers in the Army identify themselves as Roman Catholic, less than 8 percent of the Army chaplains on active duty were Roman Catholic priests. Numerically, the active component had 98 priests out of over 1,300 chaplains. Because of this critical shortage, thirteen retired priests were recalled to active duty. The  directorate  arranged  for  the  Chief  of  Chaplains  to  personally  visit twenty-eight bishops and five seminaries in FY 2000 to communicate the critical needs of the Army.

The directorate also led efforts to develop future Catholic chaplains by working in cooperation with the Archdiocese for the Military Services in sponsoring a 'Vocation Sunday' in November 1999. Vocation Sunday centered  on  telling  the  story  of  the  need  for  priests  in  every  Roman Catholic faith community in every Army chapel service. Another part of the enduring systemic approach to addressing the shortage of priests was to pursue incentives for attracting new applicants to the chaplaincy, such as  English-language  instruction  for  foreign-born  chaplains,  expedited citizenship  requests,  and  tuition  assistance.  It  became  apparent  that incentives required coordination with other agencies and activities in the Army  and  the  Department  of  Defense,  as  appropriate.  The  directorate identified eighteen possible incentives, most significantly the inclusion of chaplain candidates in the Army Reserve tuition assistance program.

FY 2000 saw a variety of changes in chaplains training. The Chief of Chaplains not only convened the Train-the-Force Committee to propose specific  training  strategies  and  evaluate  leader  development  and  soldier issues but also revived the annual Training Managers Conference in May 2000 to familiarize Chaplains Corps training managers with core themes. Sixty-five  active-  and  reserve-component  training  managers  assembled at  the  U.S.  Army  Chaplains  Center  and  School  for  the  conference. Chaplaincy  regional  sustainment  training  became  the  responsibility  of Forces Command, and each of the ten Regional Support Command regions in the United States conducts annual sustainment training for unit ministry teams in all components. The Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP), also a facet of the curriculum for the chaplain' s officer basic  course  and  family  life  training,  is  a  research-based  approach  to teaching couples how to communicate effectively, to work as a team to solve problems, to manage conflicts without damaging closeness, and to preserve and enhance commitment and friendship. Army Family Advocacy Program managers at many installations provide significant funds to train

unit chaplains not trained in PREP . PREP is the central marital educational curriculum  found  in  the  Building  Strong  and  Ready  Families  Pilot initiative, which is part of the Army chief of staff' s Well-Being Campaign Plan.

The  Personnel  and  Ecclesiastical  Relations  Directorate  gained  a separate  Accessions  Branch  under  a  uniformed  branch  chief  in  FY 2000.  The  branch  consolidated  recruiting  oversight,  appointment processing, and endorsement management; streamlined the procedures for bringing new applicants into chaplaincy programs; and developed standard  operating  procedures  to  centrally  manage  all  certificates  of ecclesiastical  endorsement  (DD  Form  2088)  for  active  and  reserve components at the level of the director of personnel. The latter change required the  Accessions  Branch  to  begin  physically  maintaining original  certificates  for  reserve-component  chaplains  as  well  as  to continue maintaining them for active-component chaplains. Certified copies are now provided to the Army Reserve Personnel Command at St. Louis, the National Guard Bureau, and other agencies as required.

The directorate's  Career  Management  Branch  implemented  two policy changes to improve chaplain utilization following specialized schooling  in  FY  2000.  The  first  change  was  to  place  more  junior major chaplains in positions that would benefit from the presence of resident Command and General Staff College graduates. The second change  eliminated  the  designation  of  nominative  assignments  for chaplain lieutenant colonels, making all lieutenant colonels eligible for  all  in-grade  assignments.  This  change  broadened  the  range  of assignments in which lieutenant colonel chaplains could serve, giving more  flexibility  to  the  assignment  process  and  increasing  career opportunities.

The  directorate's  Personnel  Actions  Branch  implemented  within major  commands  a  new  method  of  collaborative  involvement  not only  of  staff  chaplains  in  the  appointment  of  division  chaplains  but also commanders and local commanding generals in the selection of installation  chaplains.  This  new  process  emphasized  the  authority of  the  Chief  of  Chaplains  and  the  involvement  of  staff  chaplains  in the  assignment  of  senior  chaplains  while  respecting  the  key  role  of senior military commanders in making senior staff assignments. The branch also established a process, in coordination with the Directorate of  Ministry  Initiatives,  to  facilitate  and  monitor  the  accession  of individuals from underrepresented faith groups requiring exceptional actions through the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and the Office of the Secretary of the Army. This process permitted the standardization  of  procedures  for  exceptional  actions  and  decreased the time required for their successful completion.

The main concern of the directorate's Personnel Systems Branch in FY 2000 was the consolidation of gains in force structure requirements and personnel allocations. For the first time, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel approved additional companygrade inventory allocations of chaplains, offsetting religious support challenges  being  experienced  by  units  with  chaplains  attending  the fourteen-week  temporary-duty  chaplain  career  course.  Other  force structure gains allowed the Army to reach a high of 1,323 active-duty chaplain allocations, the most since the drawdown began in 1991. This increase  in  allocations  outpaced  the  branch's  ability  to  recruit  new chaplains. Recognizing this challenge, and seeing a parallel to similar challenges in other Army branches, the office approved a measure to preserve the increased end strength during a two-year ramp-up period in  company-grade  inventory.  Even  with  this  challenge,  the  branch implemented  tighter  controls  on  exceptions  to  accession  policy  to lower the average age of active-duty accessions. During FY 2000, the average age of new accessions was nearly thirty-eight years.

The  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Chaplains  initiated  staffing  action  to create Career Management Field 56, Religious Support, in FY 2000, as well as submitted a military occupational classification and structure change to update qualifications. The latter change requires new chaplain assistant  applicants  to  have  at  least  two  semesters  of  keyboarding, computer literacy, or typing.

FY 2000 saw a variety of improvements in Army religious materiel. Two Army chapels that had been approved in FY 1999 were constructed and dedicated at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and Fort Story, Virginia. The Department of Defense ecclesiastical supplies inventory added a Jewish Chaplain kit and an Islamic Chaplain kit. FY 2000 saw the containerized chapel (CC), designed for use during lengthy deployments, including all equipment and supplies needed to provide a fully functional chapel in one container, and deployed by air, sea, or land to support base camps between  550  and  1,099  persons.  During  FY  2000,  the  CC  program's operational requirements document was written and approved, and the Department of the Army approved a request to establish forty CCs in the  Collective  Support  Chapel  Operational  Project  to  assist  theater commanders. Sixteen CCs will be located in Japan for U.S. Army Pacific, twelve  CCs  in  Qatar  for  U.S. Army  Central,  ten  CCs  in  Luxembourg for U.S. Army Europe, and two CCs in Sierra Army Depot, California, for U.S. Army South. V Corps requested two prototype CCs to support Task Force Falcon in Kosovo. V Corps transferred funds to Soldier and Biological Chemical Command's product manager for soldier support to build two CCs at the Soldier Systems Center in Natick, Massachusetts, for use at Camps Bondsteel and Monteith, Kosovo.

## Army Pay

Both military and civilian personnel received a 4.4-percent pay raise beginning 1 January 2000. The FY 2000 budget also revised the military basic  pay  tables  to  increase  pay  for  mid-grade  officers  and  enlisted soldiers and provided funds to restructure the REDUX retirement system implemented in 1986. The FY 2001 budget request provides a 3.7-percent pay  raise  for  both  military  and  civilian  personnel  beginning  1  January 2001.

In FY 2000, the Army implemented several changes to incentive pay programs. The aviation continuation pay bonus, designed to retain warrant officer aviators on active duty past their initial service obligation of six years,  expanded  to  include  aviators  flying  MH-47  special  operations helicopters.  On  20  March  2000,  Army  divers  received  a  monthly  pay increase of $40, as specified in the 2000 Defense Authorization; the officer maximum rate increased to $240 per month and the enlisted maximum rate increased to $340 per month. In addition, the restriction limiting personnel to  one  hazardous  duty  pay  while  receiving  diving  pay  was  changed  to allow up to two hazardous duty incentive pays. Effective 1 April 2000, the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  raised  the  maximum  foreign language proficiency pay (FLPP) to $300 per month and established new rates. Career linguists were to be paid according to the FLPP I rates, which authorize up to $200 for one language and $300 for multiple languages. Noncareer linguists will be paid according to the FLPP II rates that vary between  $50  and  $100.  The Army  enacted  these  changes  to  create  an easily identifiable linguist pool and to encourage soldiers to improve their language proficiency through potential pay increases.

Other incentive pay programs approved in FY 2000 will start in FY 2001. On 1 October 2000, air traffic controllers with MOS 93C at a grade of  E-3  or  above  would  be  eligible  for  the  special  duty  assignment  pay program. Pay rates vary from $165 to $220 depending on duty position and training. Effective 24 October 2000, the Overseas Tour Extension Incentive Program was to be revised to add military occupational specialties and enhance the incentive options. Because of the program, personnel in all MOSs assigned to Korea and certain shortfall  MOSs  in  other  overseas locations became eligible for a $2,000 lump-sum bonus in addition to the existing incentive options.

## Army Housing

The FY 2000 family housing budget had $1.1 billion for operating and  maintaining  the  Army's  123,000  military  family  housing  units worldwide. The budget also provided for the upgrade of Army housing

by a combination of privatization in the United States and construction projects overseas. It included $469 million for maintenance and repair and provided for major projects on approximately 1,000 dwellings.

The FY 2000 family housing budget also contained $61 million for construction projects, with $14 million of the appropriation requested in FY 2000 and the remainder in FY 2001. These projects are in Korea and Germany to support military families stationed overseas, with sixty new units (valued at $24 million) to be built at Camp Humphreys, Korea, and with major improvements to be made on 424 existing units at Baumholder, Hanau, and Weisbaden, Germany.

The  FY  2000  family  housing  budget  did  not  contain  funding  for replacement construction or major renovation of family dwellings on U.S. installations. In keeping with the goal to eliminate all inadequate family housing by FY 2010, the Army is privatizing family housing through the Residential  Communities  Initiative.  This  initiative  allows  the  Army  to obtain  private-sector  capital  to  replace,  renovate,  and  maintain  military housing  units. The  FY  2000  budget  provided  for  privatization  contract awards at Fort Hood, Texas (5,482 units); Fort Lewis, Washington (3,590 units); Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia (3,159 units); and Fort Meade, Maryland (2,862 units).

In  January  2000,  the Army  implemented  the  revised  basic  housing allowance for all military personnel. This program equalizes out-of-pocket housing costs for all soldiers, sailors, and airmen, regardless of duty station. Using national average housing costs, the Army calculates allowances for personnel in each grade. If the new rate is lower, those drawing housing allowance continue at their current rate while at their current duty station. The basic housing allowance will gradually increase to reduce the soldiers' absorption cost from the current 18 percent to zero by the end of FY 2005.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

Army morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) nonappropriated funds (NAF) operating activities had their best aggregate financial performance in  several  years. Worldwide  field  NAF  instrumentalities  ended  the  year reporting  a  net  income  before  depreciation  of  $117.3  million  or  13.7 percent of revenue, exceeding the MWR board of directors' standard of 8 percent. In FY 2000, this income, which is to be reinvested in installation MWR facilities in new and replacement furniture and fixtures, renovations, and other needed improvements, was the highest recorded since FY 1991, the last year official lodging was included in installation MWR funds.

In FY 2000, Army MWR completed fifteen major NAF construction projects  (valued  at  $43  million)  as  well  as  thirty-one  capital  purchase and  minor  construction  design  and  renovation  projects  (valued  at  $4.6

million).  Fifty-seven  major  construction  projects  are  ongoing  at  fortyone installations in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Europe, Japan, and Korea. In addition, fifty-one design and minor construction support projects are active at thirty installations Army-wide.

The Army is in its fourth year of systematic upgrades to the Armed Forces recreation centers. Three MWR public-private ventures are already in  operation,  one  is  under  construction,  and  eighteen  more  are  in  the approval stage. As a result, the Army will realize a potential cost-savings of $111 million. Army MWR also supports other services for the execution of  construction  projects.  On  a  reimbursable  basis, Army  support  to  the Navy, Navy exchanges and commissary, and Marine Corps was valued at $15.3 million for FY 2000. Congress approved 19 major NAF construction projects, with a total value of $99.7 million for the FY 2001 program.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) had a strong performance  in  FY  2000,  even  though  it  was  a  very  difficult  year  for retailers in general. While sales were weaker during the critical Christmas shopping season, the continued emphasis on inventory management and operating  efficiencies  increased  earnings  proportional  to  sales  growth. AAFES worldwide total revenues of $7.329 billion were 5 percent above 1999,  despite  a  slight  decrease  in  the  customer  base  of  about  200,000 people  (or  2.5  percent)  last  year.  This  shows  a  strong  correlation  to same-store sales growth of 5.8 percent in the retail stores. The resulting AAFES earnings for FY 2000 came in at $365 million, exceeding the goal established in the Annual Financial Plan.

For FY 2000, AAFES dividends to the services' MWR funds totaled $251 million, or 68.8 percent of total earnings. This dividend represents $300 per active-duty soldier and airman, up from $284 in 1999, and marks the fifth consecutive year that per-capita dividends have increased.

In  support  of  operations,  AAFES  received  about  $141  million  in appropriated funds, representing about 2 percent of the expenses. Of this amount,  $11  million  was  applied  to  utility  costs  for  AAFES  overseas facilities,  federal  telephone  system  access,  facility  maintenance,  and the  salaries  of  the  sixty-two  active-duty Army  and Air  Force  members assigned  to AAFES.  However,  second  destination  transportation  (SDT) expenses  were  the  largest  component  of  appropriated  funding  provided to AAFES. As executive agent, the Army disbursed approximately $130 million in FY 2000 to transport U.S.-made products overseas. These funds offer  balanced  pricing  for  soldiers  and  airmen  stationed  overseas  and fulfill congressional intent to provide the staples of an American lifestyle and improve the quality of life for our military families. Through careful

management of SDT requirements, AAFES came in $5 million under the original SDT target of $135 million in FY 2000.

AAFES  earnings  fund  capital  reinvestment  as  well  as  generate dividends. Earnings from FY 2000 contributed $114 million toward the cost of new construction, renovations and upgrades to facilities, and necessary improvements to capital infrastructure. Together  with  money  conserved through depreciation, AAFES capital expenditures for FY 2000 exceeded $231 million, about 4 percent higher than the $221 million expended in 1999. While the majority of the capital program went to facilities, another $50  million  went  to  improve  customer  service  and  efficiency  through upgrades of information systems, equipment, and vehicles. Total capital expenditures for FY 2000 rose to $281 million.

In FY 2000, AAFES began managing proprietary credit card services for the exchange systems of all the services. This consolidation resulted in  a  single  all-services  private  label  credit  program,  known  to  its  1.8 million cardholders as the Military STAR. Cardholders receive a number of  benefits,  including  a  very  low  continuing  interest  rate  and  extended customer care services.

With  the  success  and  growth  of  AAFES  Internet  business,  the traditional organizational structure was changed in FY 2000 by establishing an online business region. The Cyber Region, established in August 2000, encompasses the Internet and catalog retail businesses and the call centers that support them. Internet sales grew 87.8 percent to $44 million in FY 2000 with accompanying catalog sales of $46 million.

## Command Information

The Office of the Chief of Public  Affairs (OCPA) in FY 2000 underwent a reorganization. In January 2000, it created the Resource Management Division to oversee finance, manpower, civilian and military personnel, automation,  communications,  logistics  and  supply,  and  administration for  the  entire  OCPA  organization.  Six  months  later,  the Army  chief  of staff  made  media  training  mandatory  for  all Army  general  officers  and senior executive service civilians and assigned the mission to Army Public Affairs. The training was to consist of a half-day one-on-one session of instruction and practice during three or four media interview scenarios.

During FY 2000, OCPA's community relations team worked numerous high-profile public events, including support coordination for about 550 air shows and musical and ceremonial support to local festivities nationwide before an estimated 20 million spectators, together with numerous events surrounding the Army's 225th Birthday celebration. For veterans and other service organizations, the team arranged for more than 25 Armed Forces and Veterans Day site representatives, as well as supported the national

conventions  of  the  Association  of  the  United  States  Army,  American Legion, Veterans  of  Foreign  Wars,  and  the  Noncommissioned  Officers Association. The  community  relations  team  answered  numerous  public queries. Some arrived via the White House, Capitol Hill, the Department of  Defense,  and  Army  senior  leadership;  many  others  were  received directly, including an estimated 12,000 public inquiry phone calls and as many emails.

A variety  of  media  relations  missions  took  place  in  FY  2000. The OCPA's Plans Division escorted to Bosnia and Kosovo six regional media groups serving nearly five million people. For each trip, Air Force planes took  four  media  representatives  into  either  Bosnia  or  Kosovo,  where Army  public  affairs  offices  matched  them  with  hometown  soldiers. At the same time, the OCPA-Los Angeles Branch supported the production of  the  television  film  'Pearl  Harbor,'  with  the  assistance  of  the  25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Forts Story and Lee supported the filming of 'Hearts in Atlantis.' Two other television movies also received support: 'Cutaway,' a USA Network movie that featured the Golden Knights (the U.S. Army Parachute Team), and 'Rain,' a story about a Vietnam War dog, filmed with assistance from the Puerto Rico National Guard. In addition, the branch supported the making of 73 documentaries. The Army News Service uploaded 488 articles to the Army LINK Web site, including more than 20 on Army Transformation and 12 on the secretary of the Army's education initiatives.

The  Army/Air  Force  Hometown  News  Service's  Broadcast  News and Print Divisions covered individual soldiers and airmen through the production and distribution of 550,837 print and 2,634 television and radio news releases for a combined potential reading/viewing/listening audience of  more  than  200  million.  The  Broadcast  News  Division,  along  with providing television and radio news releases throughout FY 2000, once again brought service members home for the holidays via production and distribution of more than 9,000 holiday greetings from service members and  their  families  stationed  overseas  at  more  than  fifty  installations  in twelve  countries.  It  was  the  largest  number  of  greetings  ever  recorded in  the  sixteen-year  history  of  the  program.  During  FY  2000,  the  Print Division implemented the first 'Print Holiday Greetings' program, which allowed soldiers and airmen to send greetings to their family through their hometown newspapers. Hometown News Service produced and distributed a total of 40,165 hometown news releases on service members from the thirty-nine subpar enlistment regions identified by U.S. Army Recruiting Command as needing additional emphasis for print, television, and radio coverage to promote the Army image.

The Army  Broadcasting  Service  (ABS)  and  its  overseas  broadcast outlets were deeply involved in contingency operations in FY 2000. The

Armed Forces Network (AFN) Balkans broadcast operation consolidated with the closure of AFN Hungary. Two television broadcast channels began operations  at  Camps  Bondsteel  and  Monteith.  The  AFN  Balkans  staff provided technical support during a live production of the David Letterman television show originating from Tuzla, Bosnia. ABS took over operational control of AFN Honduras once the Southern Command Network closed at the end of 1999. ABS established a one-year tour for soldiers and airmen at AFN Honduras in support of Joint Task Force bravo .

ABS underwent other changes in FY 2000. The base realignment and closure initiative will close the AFN Alaska radio station at Fort Greely on 30 April 2001, although it will continue to operate as an unmanned radio service  in  support  of  troops  stationed  in Alaska. The ABS  Engineering Division  fielded  and  conducted  new  equipment  training  on  ninety-six digital  television  camera  systems  worldwide.  The  cameras  provided overseas broadcast networks and stations with state-of-the-art equipment that  drastically  improved  quality  to  the  worldwide  audience.  With  the fielding  of  digital  cameras, ABS  radio  and  television  processes  will  be digital from acquisition to playback.

The Army Public Affairs Center undertook a variety of initiatives in FY 2000. It provided a final version of Field Manual (FM) 46-1-1, Public Affairs  Tactics,  Techniques  and  Procedures to  Training  and  Doctrine Command in early August  2000;  initiated  a  study  to  determine  fitness of  all  table  of  organization  and  equipment  standard  requirements  code 45 public affairs units in the Army; and redesigned career management fields in FY 2000, merging the Career Management Field 46, Journalist and Broadcaster, specialties at the rank of staff sergeant to create MOS 46S, Public Affairs NCO, to apply the doctrine contained in FM 100-6, Information Operations , and FM 46-1, Public Affairs Operations .

## Army Tuition Assistance Program

The  Army  continued  to implement  the Department  of Defense standardized  tuition  assistance  fiscal  policy.  Soldiers  received  75  percent of tuition costs up to $187.50 per semester-hour, whichever is less, with a maximum total yearly amount of $3,500. The $3,500 maximum total yearly amount applies to credit and noncredit courses. As a result of legislation contained  in  the  FY  2000  National  Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA), service members serving in locations designated as contingency operations by  the  secretary  of  defense  are  eligible  to  receive  100  percent  tuition assistance. The FY 2001 NDAA authorized the service secretaries to pay all or a portion of charges for tuition or expenses of members of the armed forces enrolled in off-duty education, as well as authorizing use of Montgomery GI Bill entitlements for charges not covered by tuition assistance.

Overall,  the  number  of  soldiers  participating  in  secondary  and postsecondary programs increased in FY  2000  (134,841 enrollees compared to 116,466 in FY 1999) with enrollments increasing (211,725 compared to 194,456 in FY 1999). During FY 2000, soldiers completed 43 high school or GED programs; 3,425 associate degrees; 1,583 bachelor' s degrees;  and  1,540  graduate  degrees.  The  average  tuition  assistance cost  per  enrollment  increased  from  $219.54  per  course  in  FY  1999  to $230.41 in FY 2000. In September 2000, congressional omnibus budget reprogramming  actions  funded  the  Army' s  $6.094  million  unfinanced tuition assistance requirement.

## Continuing Education

The  Army  Continuing  Education  System,  which  is  the  Army's voluntary continuing education program, provides education opportunities for soldiers as well as training and education for the civilian workforce and adult family members. A total of 113 Army education centers, supported by 138 Army learning centers, delivered programs and services in FY 2000, including  to  places  such  as  Honduras,  Southwest  Asia,  Sinai,  BosniaHerzegovina, Hungary, Macedonia, and Kosovo.

The  Army University Access Online (AUAO)  program employs information technology to offer soldiers opportunities to earn two-year degrees or technical certifications in their first four-year enlistment. During the first quarter of FY 2000, the Education Division, Personnel Command, conferred with representatives from the field and Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC)  as  well  as  from  Department  of  the  Army,  U.S.  Army  Recruiting Command, and Training and Doctrine Command. These meetings led to a final report and program proposal submitted to the assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs. The secretary of the Army approved these initiatives, and launched the AUAO program on 10 July 2000. This new initiative offered eligible soldiers the opportunity to obtain higher education degrees (certificates, associate, bachelor' s, and master' s degrees) recognized by a majority of U.S. educational institutions by maximizing the use of online education opportunities. The program featured fully funded tuition assistance, books, fees for online courses, and a technology package, including laptop computer, printer, email account, Internet access, maintenance and warranty of  equipment,  and  help  desk  assistance. The Army  planned  to  implement AUAO at its first three sites-Forts Benning (Georgia), Campbell (Kentucky), and Hood (Texas)-in FY 2001.

The  Army  Continuing  Education  System  also  encompasses  other training initiatives. A GI-to-jobs initiative seeks to improve credentialing opportunities for soldiers, with Personnel Command' s Education Division in September 2000 contracting with DynCorp to conduct a comparability

analysis  of 101  MOSs  for  bestowing  civilian  credentials  reflecting MOS skills. A Web site is under development to display information for counselors and soldiers. Also, the Education Division and SOC continued development of a career degree network through the SOC Army Degree system. A majority of the  service-related  credit  accrues  from  the  basic noncommissioned officer course onward, and thus the course is the entry point into the program. In FY 2000, the system added twenty-eight new Army career degrees. Work also progressed on the under secretary of the Army-directed initiative to automate the basic skills program in FY 2000. Human Resources Research Organization, one of two contractors working on the initiative, reviewed available basic skills commercial-off-the-shelf software and recommended three packages for basic skills and three for English as a second language as pilot programs.

## Construction, Facilities, and Real Property

The Army Military Construction Program encompasses the Military Construction,  Army;  Army Family Housing; Base Closure, Army; and  Military  Construction,  Army  Reserve.  During  FY  2000,  these subprograms contained ninety-three projects programmed at $1 billion. As of 30 September 2000, the Army had successfully awarded eighty-one projects programmed at $900 million, which equates to 87 percent of the total available program. This is the first time in three years that the Army fell  short  of  the  Department of Defense goal of 95 percent awarded by 30 September.  Receipt of high bids and Government Accounting Office protests  precluded  the  service  from  awarding  the  rest  of  the  program during FY 2000. These problems are being resolved and all projects are scheduled  for  award  during  FY  2001.  The  above-mentioned  totals  do not include thirteen projects, programmed at $200 million, whose funds were  not  available  to  the Army  either  due  to  congressional  or  defense funding holds or due to lack of environmental documentation. The Army successfully  awarded  100  percent  of  the  nine  Kosovo  supplemental projects  programmed  at  $120  million.  Some  of  these  projects  did  not become available to the Army until April 2000.

## Army Sports Program

The Army Sports Program won eight of the sixteen contested armed forces  championships  in  FY  2000.  Army  teams  won  gold  in  women' s basketball,  wrestling,  boxing,  men  and  women' s  taekwondo,  men  and women's golf,  women's  soccer,  men  and  women' s  triathlon,  and  rugby. Army  teams  placed  second  in  men' s  softball,  women' s  softball,  men' s soccer,  and  men  and  women' s  cross-country. Third  place  finishes  were

in men's basketball, men' s volleyball, women' s volleyball, and men and women's marathon.

In Conseil Internationale du Sport competitions, Army athletes were part of armed forces teams that won gold medals in men and women' s golf, men's soccer, and women's standard rifle. Second place finishes were in modern pentathlon, freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, women' s taekwondo, and women's formation sky diving. Third place finishes were in men's foil in fencing, women' s triathlon, and men' s taekwondo.

During the 2000 Olympiad, thirteen soldiers earned spaces on the U.S. Olympic teams in boxing, modern pentathlon, track and field, and shooting. Nine soldiers earned alternate spaces, and one active-duty and one retired soldier  coached.  Sfc.  James T.  Graves,  U.S. Army  Marksmanship  Unit, Fort Benning, Georgia, won a bronze medal in skeet shooting.

## Special Functions

## Environmental Protection

## Army Energy Program

The Energy Policy  Act  of  1992  and  Executive  Order  13123,  Greening  the Government Through Efficient Energy Management, require a 35-percent reduction in government-facility energy use by FY 2010, compared to an FY 1985 baseline. The Army Energy Program, managed by the U.S. Army Logistics Integration Agency and supported by the assistant chief of staff for installation management and the Army Corps of Engineers, oversees accomplishment of this goal. During FY 2000, the Department of the Army consumed 87.277 trillion British thermal units (BTUs) in its buildings and facilities, which was 24.89 percent below the FY 1985 baseline and 1.9 percent less than the previous year. This figure put the department on track to meet the FY 2005 30-percent energy reduction goal of Executive Order 12902, Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation at Federal Facilities, as well as the FY 2010 35-percent reduction goal of Executive Order 13123. Also  during  FY  2000,  the  Army' s  industrial  and  laboratory  facilities consumed 2.873 trillion BTUs. These energy-intensive facilities reduced consumption by 20.65 percent since FY 1990, the baseline year, meeting the FY 2005 goal of Executive Order 13123 and on track to meet the FY 2010 goal of a 25-percent reduction.

To achieve the goals of the Energy Policy Act and Executive Order 13031, Federal Alternative-Fueled Vehicle Leadership, the Army leased 1,840  alternative-fueled  vehicles  (AFVs)  and  thus  received  eight  extra AFV  credits  for  acquiring  medium-  and  heavy-duty  AFVs.  The  1,848 AFVs represent 62 percent of the Army's annual energy goal. The Army recently updated its AFV policy to require all activities to support Energy Policy Act goals,  wherever  practical,  and  agreed  to  pay  a  surcharge  on all General Services Administration-leased AFV vehicles to subsidize the additional costs associated with leasing.

The Army experienced increases in energy commodity costs due to high volatility in natural gas and electrical energy markets. Installations in the Pacific Northwest have experienced particularly high energy costs

and power shortages. Natural gas prices increased 7.4 percent in FY 2000 and resulted in an increase of $9 million in utility costs to the Army. The Department of Energy reported an escalation in natural gas prices. As a result, the increased prices as well as industry deregulation pushed up the electric utility rates.

## Formerly Used Defense Sites

In FY 2000, the Army, as the Department of Defense executive agent, changed the management and execution of the Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) Program, which protect health and safety of communities near more than 2,500 properties formerly owned or used by the military. One of the Army's first steps was to expand the executive agent oversight role of the Army secretariat. In addition, it is addressing concerns of the Environmental Protection Agency, state regulatory agencies, and interested community members for increased coordination and consultation during the planning, investigation and cleanup, and closure phases of projects.

In late summer 2000, the Army formed an improvement work group to recommend changes to the FUDS Program. Representatives of the Office of  the  Secretary  of  Defense;  the  Environmental  Protection Agency;  the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials; the Tribal Association for Solid Waste and Emergency Response; and the Army Corps of Engineers participated. A cornerstone of the work group recommendations was the pilot statewide management action plan (MAP) process, in which the Corps and regulatory agencies for selected states jointly  develop  pilot  statewide  MAPs  that  include  each  property  and describe a goal for cleanup, the individual projects involved, and a plan for property closeout. Community members will have the opportunity to provide input to the MAPs through restoration advisory boards.

## Army Civil Works Program

The  Civil  Works  Program,  carried  out  by  the  Corps  of  Engineers, provides for nationwide water resources development and management. The  program  carries  out  investigations  and  surveys,  engineering  and design, construction, rehabilitation, and the operation and maintenance of flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, and multiple-purpose hydroelectric  power  projects  that  together  have  a  replacement  value  of over $125 billion. In addition to this direct federal investment program, the Civil Works Program also includes an important regulatory mission whereby the Corps of Engineers regulates the discharge of dredged and fill  material  in  waters  and  wetlands  of  the  United  States.  In  developing budgetary  recommendations  for  construction  of  new  water  resources

projects,  the  Department  of  the Army  accords  priority  to  projects  that provide commercial navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and environmental restoration benefits. Shore protection studies and projects also are consistent with policy where non-federal interests agree to cost sharing proposed by the administration. Congress has added funds for lowpriority activities, such as recreation projects, and for activities normally accomplished by non-federal interests, such as wastewater treatment and water supply.

The  total  FY  2000  appropriation  for  the  Civil  Works  Program was  $4.119  billion,  an  increase  of  $21  million  from  the  previous  year. This  appropriation  included  funding  for  construction  ($1.373  billion), operations  and  maintenance  ($1.856  billion),  Mississippi  River  and tributaries, ($308 million), general investigations ($165 million), regulatory programs ($117 million), flood control and coastal emergencies (funded from prior year carryover), the FUDS Remedial Action Program ($150  million),  and  general  expenses  ($150  million).  In  addition,  nonfederal cash contributions, mostly through cost-sharing agreements, came to $317 million. By business areas, Civil Works Program funding for FY 2000  was  navigation,  $1.758  billion;  flood  and  coastal  storm  damage prevention, $1.252 billion; environmental and regulatory programs, $630 million; hydropower, $224 million; recreation, $242 million; emergency management, $6.2 million; and water supply, $1.3 million.

The  Corps  of  Engineers  made  significant  strides  in  environmental restoration  projects,  including  Everglades,  Florida;  Sonoma  Baylands, California; and Poplar Island, Maryland.  The Napa River, California, project was  initiated,  combining  structural,  nonstructural,  and  environmental restoration  measures  to  resolve  numerous  water  resources  issues  and problems in the watershed. The Corps of Engineers operated 383 major lakes and reservoirs, in addition to building hundreds of local protection projects now operated and maintained by non-federal authorities. Many of  these  flood-damage  prevention  projects  serve  additional  purposes, including  the  seventy-five  hydroelectric  power  plants,  with  an  installed generating  capacity  of  20,720  megawatts,  at  its  dams.  The  Corps  of Engineers owns and operates 24 percent of U.S. hydropower capacity, or 3 percent of total U.S. electric capacity.

Despite  federal  and  state  policies  for  land-use  planning,  hazard mitigation,  and  flood-proofing  of  buildings,  population  shifts  toward riverine and coastal areas increase the potential economic, environmental, and  social  costs  from  floods.  Urban  development  in  the  flood  plain  is increasing, but less than 15 percent of U.S. communities have structural flood protection, and only 20-30 percent of buildings in the regulated 100year flood plains carry flood insurance. In view of this situation, interest from states and local governments remained high for services and assistance

provided  under  the  Flood  Plain  Management  Services  and  Planning Assistance  to  States  initiatives.  The  Flood  Plain  Management  Services Program provided over 44,000 responses to requests for information and technical  assistance  on  floods  and  flood  plain  management  topics. The Planning Assistance  to  States  Program  executed  128  agreements,  with forty  states  and  nine  Indian  tribes,  for  such  study  topics  as  flood  plain mapping, wetlands banking, water quality, water supply, and environmental restoration.

The  Corps  of  Engineers  is  charged  with  the  regulation  of  various filling and construction-related activities in U.S. waters and wetlands by Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; Section 103 of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (Ocean Dumping Act); and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. During FY 2000, the  Corps  authorized  almost  90,000  activities,  with  90  percent  approved within  sixty  days.  About  6,500  proposed  activities  required  extensive review for an individual permit, approval for the rest falling under regional or nationwide general permits, which are issued to the public at large and cover certain minor activities with minimal environmental impacts. These activities  do  not  usually  require  extensive  review  and  can  thus  avoid  the requirements  involved  in  obtaining  individual  permits.  Use  of  general permits provides significant relief for the regulated public by simplifying approval for thousands of small projects. The Corps denied 180 permits in FY 2000, primarily because most applicants could not obtain other state or local authorizations. Projects that the Corps might otherwise deny are issued permits only after they have been modified, scaled down, or conditioned to meet Corps requirements. In addition, other applicants withdraw before a final  decision.  Corps  regulatory  personnel  made  over  60,000  jurisdiction determinations in FY 2000 to determine whether Corps authorities covered the  locations  involved.  To  provide  greater  protection  for  the  nation' s aquatic resources, the Corps issued new and modified nationwide permits in March 2000 but effective in June 2000, approving some 40,000 in FY 2000. At the same time, it implemented an administrative appeals process for both permit denials and jurisdiction determination. Previously, the only recourse for applicants was through the courts, a potentially costly and time-consuming process.

The  Formerly  Utilized  Sites  Remedial Action  Program  (FUSRAP) involves  the  cleanup  of  residual  contamination  at  sites  involved  in  the nation' s early atomic  energy  development  program,  including  work done  by  the  Manhattan  Engineer  District.  The  Department  of  Energy began  the  program  in  the  early  1970s  and  transferred  it  to  the  Corps of  Engineers  by  congressional  action  in  FY  1998.  The  Corps  carries out cleanup  in accordance  with  the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). At the time of

transfer,  remediation  at  twenty-one  of  the  forty-six  identified  FUSRAP sites remained to be completed. As of the end of FY 2000, the Corps had completed remediation at three of these remaining sites. FUSRAP sites are located principally in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area, the Buffalo, New Y ork, metropolitan area, and in northern New Jersey. There are also sites in Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland, and southern New Jersey. The  Corps  and  the  Department  of  Energy  entered  into  an agreement defining each organization's responsibility for FUSRAP . The department referred nine additional sites to the Corps for possible addition to  the  program,  depending  on  whether  cleanup  is  required  to  address residual contamination. The Corps placed one of these sites in the program based on the FY 2001 appropriations act report. As of the end of FY 2000, addition of a second site is expected, once congressional notification has been completed, based on a determination of radiological contamination that  exceeded  current  standards. At  FY  2000  funding  levels,  excluding requirements that might result from new sites, an additional $1.2 billion will be necessary to complete FUSRAP after 2001, with work extending until 2010.

## Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The  Army exceeded the Department of Defense goal assigned for prime contracts awarded to small business and small disadvantaged businesses every year for the last eight years, with the exception of the small business goal for FY 2000 that was not assigned until the end of the fiscal year. It awarded approximately $40 billion to small businesses over the last five years,  and  in  FY  2000,  became  the  first-and  so  far  the  only-federal agency to award more than $1 billion to women-owned small businesses in a fiscal year. Table 20 below lists recent Army small business contracting activity.

The  Military  Spouse  Entrepreneurial  Training  Program  (MSETP), patterned  after  an  earlier  entrepreneurial  readiness  program  sponsored by the Department of Defense in coordination with the Small Business Administration,  is  a  pilot  program  that  provides  interested  military spouses  with  the  instructions  necessary  for  starting  and  managing  a small business. MSETP is a two-phased training program. The first phase is  a  1½-hour  introduction  to  business  ownership,  intended  to  focus  on the responsibilities and expectations involved in owning a business; the second phase is a 36-hour training course covering aspects of business ownership, including business planning, financial projections, marketing, accounting, and selling, as well as legal and insurance issues. In the course of completing the program, participants develop a detailed business plan. The first  MSETP training commenced at Fort Bliss on 9 August 2000;

other  MSETP  pilot  sites  were  Fort  Jackson  and  Heidelberg,  Germany. About two hundred military spouses were participating in MSETP as of the end of FY 2000, with the program scheduled to run through November 2000.

## Legal Affairs

In FY 2000, 1,449 judge advocates were on active duty, 2,384 judge advocates were in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, and 383 civilian attorneys were subject to the qualifying authority of The Judge Advocate  General.  Together,  these  attorneys  support  more  than  three hundred legal offices in the continental United States and sixteen foreign countries. In 2000, the Army Judge Advocate General Corps added 191 new judge advocates.

During FY 2000, Army court-martial rates increased 8.2 percent from FY 1999. General courts-martial decreased by 2.9 percent; bad-conduct special  courts-martial  decreased  by  1.9  percent;  special  courts-martial decreased from 10 to 8; and summary courts-martial increased 37 percent, from 487 to 666. Nonjudicial punishments increased by 7.1 percent, from 38,879  to  41,632.  A  comparison  of  general,  bad-conduct  special,  and special courts-martial, and nonjudicial punishments for FY 1994 through FY 2000 is outlined in Table 21 below.

The Army Procurement Fraud Division opened 310 new cases during the  year  and  completed  action  on  275  cases.  The  incoming  caseload increased substantially over the previous year, reversing a steady four-year decline in fraud cases. At the end of FY 2000, the division was monitoring over  600  active  cases  involving  fraud  or  irregularities  in  the  Army' s procurement process. The Army recovered $60 million in civil fraud cases in FY 2000. The bulk of the Army' s recovery came from a settlement with the  Boeing  Company  to  remedy  problems  with  defective  flight  critical gears  in  CH-47D  (Chinook)  helicopters.  In  criminal  fraud  matters, nineteen Army contractors were indicted and eleven previously indicted contractors were convicted during FY 2000. The Army suspended fifteen contractors under investigation and debarred fifty-five poorly performing, fraudulent, or unethical contractors during FY 2000.

The number of new appeals docketed with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals declined slightly this past fiscal year from 126 in FY 1999 to 107 in FY 2000. During FY 2000, the Contract Appeals Division resolved 170 cases. Of these appeals, 60 percent resulted in settlements favorable to the government or were cases where the government prevailed. An additional 35 percent were dismissals.

Environmental litigation grew to over 100 cases in FY 2000, mostly under  CERCLA  and  involving  such  issues  as  cleanup  of  unexploded

ordnance  and  contamination  of  third-party  sites  such  as  landfills.  The rest of the cases spanned the spectrum of environmental laws and issues, including  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act,  Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation Act, fee and tax  issues,  water  rights,  and  toxic  torts.  In  addition,  considerable Army and Department of Justice resources went to the defense of the Chemical Demilitarization Program, which has the mission of destroying America' s stockpile of chemical weapons. The Army also dealt with the conservation and recovery requirements of the Endangered Species Act and all aspects of the various laws regulating media such as air and water, and solid and hazardous wastes.

Under the Commercial Activities Program, the Army contracted out those operations essential to its mission but not required to be performed by military and civilian personnel. In the solicitation and source selection phases,  Army  attorneys  reviewed  all  commercial  activities  documents, such as acquisition plans, solicitations, source selection plans, evaluation plans for technical performance plans (in-house plan), competitive range determinations, pre-negotiation objective memorandums, price negotiation memorandums,  and  source  selection  decisions.  Army  attorneys  also provided guidance in the selection and training of members of the source selection evaluation boards, which evaluate private-sector proposals.

In the area of law of war, the Army Judge Advocate General Corps had primary responsibility for developing the Joint Services Law of War Manual. The Office of The Judge Advocate General, as it implemented Department of Defense Directive 5000.1, Defense Acquisition , and Army Regulation  27-53, Review  of  Legality  of Weapons  Under  International Law , also conducted more than two dozen legal reviews of new weapon systems,  weapons,  and  munitions  (both  conventional  and  nonlethal)  to ensure their compliance with U.S. policy, law of war treaties, and arms control agreements to which the United States is a party.

The Judge Advocate General' s School prepared a homosexual conduct policy training package in response to a 21 July 2000 directive issued by the Army chief of staff. The training package included individual instruction materials  for  judge  advocates,  commanders,  noncommissioned  officers, and soldiers. Army lawyers also reviewed and contributed to the creation of a new training guide entitled 'Dignity and Respect: A Training Guide on Homosexual Conduct Policy,' to reinforce to members of the service that Army policy prohibited harassment of soldiers believed to be homosexual.

In  FY  2000,  the Army  received  2,725  informal  equal  employment opportunity complaints brought by Army civilians alleging discrimination based  on  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  age,  disability,  or reprisal. This total includes 429 requests for alternative dispute resolution, which resolved 258 disputes.

The  U.S.  Army  Claims  Service  settled  39,960  personnel  claims totaling  $35.4  million  in  the  fiscal  year.  These  settlements  reimbursed soldiers and other government personnel for personal property loss and damage incident to  service.  During  this  same  year,  the  Claims  Service settled 2,526 tort claims for over $17 million. These payments included personal injury and death claims, property damage claims, environmental claims, and operational claims.

## Inspector General Activities

The mission of The Inspector General and the U.S. Army Inspector General  Agency  is  to  inquire  into  the  state  of  discipline,  efficiency, economy, morale, training, and readiness throughout the Army. During FY 2000, the Assistance Division handled 1,902 inspector general action requests (IGARs), a slight decrease from 1,933 in FY 1999. Of the 1,902 IGARs,  1,291  (68  percent)  were  requests  for  assistance  and  610  (32 percent) were allegations. Of the 610 allegations, 178 (29 percent) were substantiated and 432 (71 percent) were nonsubstantiated. The inspector general system no longer authorizes the use of 'neither substantiated nor refuted' as a determination. All allegations must result in a substantiated or nonsubstantiated determination.

The IGARs received in FY 2000 came from a variety of sources, including  20  presidential  (a  slight  increase  from  15  in  FY  1999), 135 congressional (up from 96 in FY 1999), and 79 senior Army and defense leadership (up from 61 in FY 1999). Of the 1,902 IGARs, 682 (36  percent)  came  from  the  active  components;  141  (7  percent)  from the reserve components; 500 (26 percent) from civilians; and 579 (30 percent) from complainants whose status was unknown. The Department of  Defense  Hotline  requested  342  IGARs.  DoD whistleblower IGARs significantly increased, totaling 72 for FY 2000, compared to 37 in FY 1999.

Six  functional  categories  of  IGARs  accounted  for  the  bulk  of complaints in FY 2000. Personal Conduct, including sexual harassment, racial  discrimination,  and  nonsupport  of  family,  was  cause  for  560 IGARs or 29 percent. Command/Management of Organizations, which includes caring for soldiers and family members, storage and shipment of property, and exercising command influence, prompted 358 IGARs (19  percent).  Personnel  Management-Military,  including  recruiting operations, reassignments, evaluation reports, promotions, separations, awards, and decorations, led to 296 IGARs (16 percent), while Personnel Management-Civilian  accounted  for  164  (9  percent).  Finance  and Accounting,  which  includes  travel  pay,  basic  allowance,  base  pay inquires, and reimbursements, was the source of 98 IGARs (5 percent).

Health Care, including medical evaluation boards, medical staff attitude, medical records, and TRICARE, accounted for 97 of IGARs or 5 percent.

The  Inspections  Division' s  primary  charge  remains  to  evaluate  the Army's ability to meet the demands of the National Military Strategy and periodically  report  the  division' s  conclusions  to  Army  leadership.  This endeavor involves executing a schedule of planned inspections addressing a  broad  spectrum  of  force  readiness  and  resource  management  issues affecting all components. In addition, the Inspections Division regularly performs assessments of contemporary issues prompting the immediate concern of the Army secretariat and staff. The Inspections Division began three  such  assessments  in  FY  2000.  In  October  1999,  the  secretary  of defense requested a review of the allegations made in the public media that U.S. military personnel killed hundreds of civilians near No Gun Ri, Republic of Korea, in July 1950; the review was ongoing at the end of the fiscal year. In January 2000, the secretary of the Army ordered a special assessment of allegations of violations of the DoD Homosexual Conduct Policy at Fort Campbell, culminating in the death of Pfc. Barry Winchell in  July  1999, together with an overall assessment of the Department of the  Army's  implementation  of  the  policy.  In  July  2000,  The  Inspector General found that the overall command climate at Fort Campbell was adequate,  but  that  the  climate  in  Private  Winchell' s  particular  unit  was not.  In  addition,  the  assessment  found  that  commanders  in  general  had difficulty administering the homosexual conduct policy and that published Army guidance concerning the policy was inadequate. In April 2000, the Senate Armed Services Committee directed the secretary of the Army to initiate an inspection of Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Program (JROTC) programs to determine whether they were properly resourced and equipped and to compare the resourcing of Army JROTC programs with that of the other services. This inspection was ongoing at the end of FY 2000.

During  FY  2000,  the  Technical  Inspections  Division  conducted numerous scheduled, compliance-oriented inspections of Army organizations  with  nuclear  or  chemical  surety  missions.  The  Technical Inspections Division inspected the surety compliance of eleven chemical agent storage sites, three chemical agent demilitarization facilities, four civilian  contract  chemical  defense  laboratories,  two  chemical  defense research laboratories, five Army signal units that support nuclear missions, two  nuclear  reactors,  the Army  technical  escort  unit,  and  the  chemical ordnance biological radiological training facility.

The  Intelligence Oversight Division mission again focused on inspections  of  Army  special  access  programs  and  sensitive  activities and  the  inspections  for  intelligence  oversight.  The  division  continued the deputy chief of staff for intelligence' s request to enforce compliance

with procedures governing the control of foreign liaison officers. During inspections,  the  teams  continued  looking  at  command  safety  programs, especially  individual  and  organizational  security  measures  within  the electronic workplace to ensure that information was being processed at the appropriate levels of classification, and implemented a proactive teachand-train process during inspections to assist the personnel inspected. In FY 2000, the division performed thirty intelligence oversight inspections, thirteen  special  access  program  and  sensitive  activity  inspections,  three assistances or investigations, and one whistleblower investigation.

During FY 2000, the Training Division conducted nine iterations of the three-week inspector general course. The nine classes graduated 513 students (230 officers, 216 noncommissioned officers, 53 civilians, and 14 from other services, including foreign countries). The division' s Inspector General Refresher Course graduated 34 students from two classes. The Inspector General Worldwide Network (IGNET) Site  Administrator Course graduated 52 students in seven classes. Training of foreign nationals also continued. In addition to resident attendance by officers from Saudi Arabia and Slovenia, the commandant of the Army Inspector General School and a faculty member briefed the Georgian delegation in April.

The  Investigations  Division  investigates  allegations  against  general officers,  senior  executive  service  civilian  employees,  and  other  officials in high-visibility positions. During FY 2000, the division received 1,211 allegations and completed 27 formal investigations and 188 preliminary inquiries. Of the allegations formally investigated, the Inspections Division substantiated  approximately  9  percent.  The  most  frequently  received allegation was abuse of authority.

## The Army and Arms Control

## Chemical Weapons Convention

In FY 2000, the U.S. Army was fully engaged in implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, including continuing to meet obligations for  destruction  of  chemical  weapons  and  former  chemical  weapons production  facilities,  as  well  as  supporting  inspections  and  visits  at  all declared Army facilities. In FY 2000, the Army supported Organization for  the  Prohibition  of  Chemical  Weapons  inspections  of  all  declared chemical weapons storage, chemical weapons production facilities, and Schedule 1 (chemical weapons agent) facilities. This included inspections of  ten  storage  facilities  at  eight Army  installations,  thirteen  facilities  at four Army installations, and one contractor location (Swannanoa, North Carolina), but no inspections of Schedule 1 facilities at Army installations.

The Army depot and activity  commanders  and  their  staffs  successfully facilitated all of these inspections.

## Global Humanitarian Demining

In December 1997, the Department of Defense designated the Army as its executive agent supporting the Department of State in carrying out the president' s Demining 2010 Initiative. A Department of State official served as the special representative for the president and secretary of state for global humanitarian demining (GHD), with the military deputy to the deputy under secretary of the Army for international affairs designated to serve as the deputy special representative. The special representative and his  staff  assumed  responsibility  for  organizing  and  coordinating  global efforts to eliminate the threat of landmines to civilians worldwide by the year 2010. In FY 2000, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for International Affairs continued to provide a major to serve on the GHD staff at the Department of State. This officer served as the military liaison and full-time representative of the deputy special representative.

The  GHD  staff  continued  to  foster  partnerships  with  a  number  of U.S.  and  internationally  based  nongovernmental  organizations.  Partners included the Marshall Legacy Institute, the United Nations Association of  the  United  States  of  America,  the  Vietnam  Veterans  of  America Foundation, Global Care Unlimited, the Survey Action Center, Landmine Survivors  Network,  the  Center  for  International  Rehabilitation, the Rockefeller Foundation, Roots of Peace, the United Nations Foundation, James Madison University, the University of Denver' s Center for Teaching International  Relations,  and  the  Polus  Center  for  Social  and  Economic Development. In FY 2000, the Office of the Special Representative added five  new partnerships, for a total of twenty-five. Two GHD-coordinated meetings focused on nongovernmental  organization involvement in humanitarian demining highlighted the FY 2000 partnership program.

Working  closely  with  colleagues  in  the  Department  of  Defense, European Union, and the international community, the GHD staff continued to  coordinate  international  research  and  development  for  humanitarian demining. In FY 2000, these efforts resulted in three international test and evaluation programs for humanitarian demining technologies. After GHD coordination between the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, heavy demining equipment is now being field-tested in Lebanon. The GHD staff also helped arrange a Department of Energy landmine detection test and evaluation agreement with the Government of  Spain  and,  more  recently,  was  actively  involved  in  the  coordination of  information  technology  developments  in  the  Horn  of Africa  and  the Balkans. Ongoing efforts included the International Test and Evaluation

Program and the Demining Technology Information Forum, both initiated in FY 1999.

The  GHD  staff  also continued to conduct public outreach in universities,  humanitarian  demining  conferences,  public-  and  privatesponsored  meetings,  and  other  venues,  presenting  information  on  U.S. humanitarian demining programs and U.S. leadership in demining efforts. In FY 2000, GHD members participated in numerous events, including a  presentation  at  the  Organization  of American  States Annual  Planning Conference,  roundtable  participation  at  both  the  Fletcher  School  of Law  and  Diplomacy  at Tufts  University  and  the  J.  F .  Kennedy  School of  Government  at  Harvard  University,  and  a  presentation  at  the  annual Security Assistance Conference at Central Command in Tampa, Florida.

## Conclusion

The wide variety of missions characterizing the aftermath of the Cold War  continued  for  the  U.S. Army  in  FY  2000,  albeit  with  some  relief compared to previous years. Army forces deployed throughout not only the Middle East, Central Europe, and Latin America on peacekeeping and counternarcotics  missions,  but  also  the  United  States  on  disaster  relief missions.  Meanwhile,  perception  of  the  rising  threat  of  terrorists  using weapons of mass destruction produced a new set of Army responsibilities. All these tasks took place within the constraints of a National Military Strategy  requiring  the  Army  to  plan,  train,  and  equip  for  potential engagement in two simultaneous major theater wars.

Fulfilling such a wide range of missions required considerable effort. In FY 2000, the Army typically had nearly 125,000 soldiers and 15,000 U.S.  civilians  stationed  in  over  a  hundred  countries  while  averaging 26,000  additional  soldiers  deployed  on  operations  and  exercises;  these deployments  took  soldiers  to  some  sixty-eight  countries.  While  these commitments represented a slightly lower level compared to recent fiscal years, they still represented a substantial fraction of the active force.

The Army had to meet these demands with relatively limited resources. In keeping with the recommendations of the Quadrennial Defense Review, the congressionally mandated end strength of 480,000, active Army end strength declined slightly from 479,426 in FY 1999 to 479,026 by the end of FY 2000. In contrast, the active force totaled 781,000 at the end of the Cold War in FY 1989. The Army slightly exceeded its recruiting goals for FY 2000, but fell slightly short of its retention goals.

The  slight  decline  in  available  personnel  contrasted  with  improved funding. The Army's FY 2000 total obligation authority of $68.6 billion represented an increase of $4.9 billion, or 7.7 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year; its FY 2001 budget request for $70.8 billion in total obligation authority sought to continue the trend. The Army' s share of the defense  budget  remained  near  25  percent,  despite  the  service' s  having provided the bulk of the forces in major joint military operations since FY 1989.

To  better  meet  extensive  operational  demands  within  its  limited personnel  ceiling,  the Army  took  a  variety  of  measures  in  FY  2000 to conserve and enhance its human capital. The service worked to improve

recruiting  through  new  data  systems  and  enhanced  marketing  efforts and addressed potential problems with retention by expanding selective reenlistment  bonus  programs  and  reducing  administrative  barriers  to reenlistment. At the same time, the Army worked to improve recruitment, attrition, and retention rates by bettering the quality of life for soldiers; continuing  to  increase  stability,  defined  as  time  on  a  given  station,  for soldiers  between  deployments;  and  continuing  its  programs  to  upgrade barracks  and  on-post  housing. The Army  continued  its  efforts  to  open more career fields to women, which had begun in 1994, while working to establish an improved climate for female and minority personnel through a variety of human relations programs. The Army chief of staff also sought to use existing personnel more efficiently by reorienting manning policies, ordering a four-year campaign to fully man, by MOS and grade, all Army units, beginning with the Army's ten divisions and two armored cavalry regiments.

The Army also continued to rely heavily on employment of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve to meet mission requirements in FY 2000. The Reserve components made up slightly less than 54 percent of total Army force structure, providing combat support and combat service support forces needed in disproportionate numbers for operations other than war and support to civil authorities. In keeping with the Total Force initiative, the Army implemented plans to integrate active- and reservecomponent units into the same divisions, as well as planning to activate multicomponent units below the division level. The reserve components added new capabilities to address evolving threats, notably in information operations.

In  the  face  of  increasing  demands  on  decreasing  resources,  the Army identified, developed, and deployed new technologies that greatly improve  unit  effectiveness.  The  existing  experiments  in  digitization  of Army forces led to an overall plan to refurbish the existing Legacy Force while developing a new Objective Force. This force would be capable of exploiting  new  technologies  to  deliver  greater  combat  power  on  short notice, in missions across the spectrum of military operations, at the same time reducing the logistical burden associated with the Legacy Force. To gain experience for the Objective force, the Army chief of staff ordered the creation of the Interim Force based on brigades of light armored vehicles transportable in C-130 aircraft.

The Army also improved its logistical arrangements by using the same technological  innovations  as  those  involved  in  digitization  to  enhance its  logistics.  In  FY  2000,  it  continued  its  adoption  of  new  systems  for tracking supplies through radio-frequency tracking devices and bar-coding in  concert  with  automated  inventory  systems,  as  well  as  implementing similar  systems  for  managing  spare-parts  supplies  and  maintenance

procedures.  These  enhanced  logistical  systems  thus  support  increased demands for strategic mobility. The Army continued its program to expand its maritime prepositioning capabilities in conjunction with the U.S. Navy, having acquired the first eight of fifteen new large, medium-speed roll-on/ roll-off cargo ships. In support of this capacity, the Army also enhanced its logistics-over-the-shore capabilities with new landing craft and floating cranes.  These  improved  facilities  should  combine  with  the  smaller logistical demands of the heavy forces reorganized to the Division XXI structure to increase the strategic mobility of heavy forces.

The demands of digitization and increased deployment levels underscore the great importance of the Army's development and modernization  efforts. To  exploit  the  information  resources  inherent  in digitization, the Army has continued to develop its weapons systems to achieve and preserve overmatch capabilities in combat, enhancing existing systems while conducting research on new ones. In FY 2000, the Army continued  the  enhancement  of  its  deep-attack  capabilities. A  variety  of deep-attack  initiatives,  both  new  weapons,  such  as  the  BAT  precisionguided  submunitions,  and  improvements  of  existing  systems,  such  as MLRS and ATACMS, seek to exploit developing information dominance capabilities.  Along  with  enhanced  range  and  accuracy,  an  important goal has been greater strategic mobility through lowered system weight, manning, and logistical requirements. The Army also worked to improve the effectiveness of light forces, both by integrating digitization systems pioneered in the heavy force and by accelerating the development of such weapons systems as HIMARS and the Javelin antiarmor missile. A major thrust of future materiel development, notably the Future Combat Systems slated  to  replace  the  current  generation  of  tanks  and  armored  fighting vehicles, will be a reduction of vehicle weight to no more than twenty tons, both to facilitate initial rapid deployment and to reduce the logistical tail of deployed forces. At the individual level, systems are under development to  equip  the  individual  infantry  soldier  for  a  challenging  environment encompassing night combat, military operations in urban terrain, and a renewed threat from weapons of mass destruction.

By the end of FY 2000, the Army was well into its transition from a Cold War force optimized for major theater wars to a force prepared for employment across the spectrum of military operations. The service had completed its drawdown in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and  had  taken  substantial  steps  to  cope  with  the  operational,  materiel, and  human  strains  of  numerous  worldwide  commitments.  Nonetheless, the  Army's  leaders  had  recognized  the  inadequacy  of  piecemeal  and evolutionary  adaptation  to  the  new  environment  and  embarked  on  a transformative  campaign  to  enhance  the  service' s  human,  materiel,  and information resources accordingly.
