## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 1995

## Introduction

Throughout  Fiscal  Year  (FY) 1995,  Ihe  Army  faced  chal lenges  of change and transition because of  continuing post- Cold War personnel and force  reductions. These  reductions  have  created an Army that  is  smaller than at  any time si nce before World  War II.  As the Army has dealt wit h the effects of these reductions,  it  has had  to  support  a mltional  military strat› egy that req uires the United Slates to remain engaged abroad, particularly in regions  where  its  most  important  interests  were  at  stake.  The  Army played a  major role  in  FY  1995  in  some of Ihe  principal clements of the U.S.  strategy of  engagement and cnhlrgcment: to enhance national securi› ty  by maintaining a  strong defense capability and  championing coopera› tive security measures, and to  promote democracy abroad through peace› keeping and security assistance missions. In  support of  this strategy, units and personnel were deployed overseas to  numerous locations.

Starting in  1989, the Army has been faced with several major changes. It is  moving  from  a  fOlward-positioncd  force  to  a  largely  U.S.-based power-projection force. The service is shifting  from  a Cold  War foclls on a  singlc  threat,  the  Soviet  Union,  to  a  force  designcd  to  counter a  wide spectrum of  unpredictable dangers and threats. Final ly, the Army has gonc from  a  force structurc of 18 active div isions with end strength of 777,000 active  duty  soldiers  to a  force  to  be  stabi li zed  in 1996 at  10 active  divi› sions with cnd strength of  495,000.

In  addressing  the  challenges  the  service  faced,  senior Army  leaders recognized  that  the Army's budget  h'ld  decreased  38  percent since  1989 and  that  the service  faced  hard  decisions  during  the  fiscal  yea r  among readi ness, investment  in  modernization and  futu re readiness, and the need to maintain a high-quality force within budgetary constraints.  Noting that the  nation's  resources  available  for  defense  were  li mited,  senior  Army leaders emphasized  that  uncertainties  in  the  international  strategic envi› ronment and our national stratcgy required an Army ready and capable of responding quickly and decisively to  protect our national  interests.

As the Army moved toward the twenty-first ccntury, it confrontcd thrce major chal1cnges:  maintaining readiness, stabilizing its  force, and  bceom› ing more efficient. To  fund  force levels and 10  recruit, train, and  retain the

quality  personnel  that  would  enable  the  Army  to  carry  out  ils  missions required  that  the  service  defer some  modernization  programs during  FY 1995. The Army was on track to meet its recruiting goal  for the  fiscal  year of 63,000  personnel,  but  stopped  recruiting  when  the  accession  level reached 62,931  personnel. This action was taken to stay within the Army's authorized strength  level and alleviate a  potential  financial shortfall in  the Military Pay, Army. account. Proper training ensured that  soldiers,  leaders, and  units  \vcre  prepared  to  fight  and  wi n.  The  combat  tra ining  centers (CTC) continued  to be the centerpiece of the Army's training  program.  In FY  1995, seventy-seven maneuver battalions trained at the threc mancuver crCs,  where  soldiers  were  exposed  to  an  environment  of unrestricted foree·on-foree  training and  live-fire  exercises  that  simulated  actual  com› bat.  Retaining high-quality  soldiers, particularly those in  their first term of service,  was  another  important  contribution  to maintaining  personnel readiness.  Equally  important was the retention of the skills and experience of soldiers  leaving  the  active  force  through  their affi liation  with  rcserve component  units.  In  FY  1995,  the Army  reenlisted  19,960  first-term sol› diers and 23,358 mid-career soldiers. A total of 13,737 separating soldiers were  assigned  to  the  reserve  components---8,41 3  to  the  Army  National Guard (ARNG) and 5,324 to the U.s, Army  Reserve (USA R).

Modernization  was imperative as the Army prepared  to enter a  new century. A smaller army requircd wcapons of increased lethality and pre› cision  through  the  replacement  or  improvemcnt  of older  weapons  sys› tems and equipment. Because of budget constraints, the Army's modern› iz. 1tion  s trategy  for  FY 1995  focused  on  selective  upgrades  of existing capabilitics  and  the  replaccmcnt  of technically  obsolete  systems.  The upgrades  of the  Abrams  tank  and  the  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicle  were among programs continued during the fisca l year, whi lc several programs such as  the  Multiple  Launch Rocket System and the Avenger air defense system were discontinued.

In  FY  1995, the Army entered what appeared to  be the  last  turbu lent stagcs of personnel reductions,  base closures,  inactiva› tions  and  unit  real ign ments;  however,  the  Army  also  continued  to  see increases  in  its  operational  commitmcnts  that  added  to  the  forcc's insta› bility. The Army  maintained  125,000 soldiers at  forward  installations  in Europe,  the  Pacific,  and  Panama.  In  FY  1995,  soldiers  were  engaged  in many diverse opemtions such as countcrdrug,  noncombatant evacuation, nation  assistance,  and  humanitarian  and  disaster  relief.  The  Army  con› ducted  opcrations  in  support o f  national  objectives  in  Somalia,  Kuwai t, Haiti, and other countries. Soldicrs a lso performed disaster relief l11issions in  the  United  Slatcs,  providing  earthqua ke  relief  in  California,  fighting forest  fires  in  the  West, assisting  flood  victims in thc  Midwest, and hel p-

ing  law enforcement agencies to  stem  the  flow  of illicit  drugs  across the borders of the United States.

Over the  same  period,  the  Army  experienced a  threefold  increase  in operational deployments. On any given day in  1995, in addition 10  100,000 soldiers  stationed  in  Eu rope  and  Korea, the  Army  avemgcd  over  20,000 soldiers  deployed  in  over  80  countries.  Meanwhile,  a  sharp  decline  in resources  had  reduced  Army  total  obligation authori ty  36 percent.  Fiscal reality exacted  its toll:  the  Army  barely  maintained  operational  readiness and,  then, only by deferring needed investment in  modernization.

The  Army  also  sought  to  improve  its  efficiency  du ring  FY 1995. Among its goals, the service sought to  achieve savings that would pay  for a  force  struct ure  comlllensur(l.le  with  the  Army's  operational commit· mcnlS, to  increase  invest ment in  crucial  modernization programs,  and  to increase spending on quality·of~life programs. Army leaders worked with the  Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal  agencies throughout the fiscal  year on " variety of  cosHulting initiatives, such as streamlining the  work  force,  implementing  acquisition  reform,  and  simplifyi ng  and reducing regulations pertaining to the contracting of goods and  services. In developing its elTiciency strategy, the Army looked to the private sector for examples. By specifying how a system should perform instead of  spec› ifying  how  it  should be manufactured,  for  example,  the  Army  saved money  on  the  costs  of  developing  weapons  systems, such  as the Comanche  helicopter,  and  on  facilities  maintenancc  contracts  at  Army installations. ThcArmy's  goal was to create significant  savings by drivi ng down  the  cost of doing  business,  carefully  managing constrained  fiscal resources, and continuing to  adopt sound  business practices.

In FY 1995, the  Army  began to see the  end or  the turbulent post- Cold  WCIr  period  or restructuring  its  forces  and  reducing  its  per› sonnel strength, military and civilian. At  the same time, the service  was engagcd in  several  initiatives, Stich as Army  XX I, to  shape the Army or the  future.  The Army  had  done more than  prudently downsize the  rorce that won the Cold War and Operation DESERT  STORM. It had  begun con~ verting  from an Army  rooled  in  the  industrial  age to  an  army ex ploring the  imperatives  of the  informa tion  age.  In  the  vanguard  of new  and rapidly  developing  technologies,  the  Army  was  already  aggressively seeking  ways  to  apply digital  technologies  to  the  battlefield.  An  ea rly step  in  1994  inaugurated  Force  XXI.  Neither a  force  nor even  a  force design,  Force  XXI  painted  a  vision  of the  twenty-first  century  Army. Already  in  place,  the  vision  for  the  future  Army  meshed  comfortably with Joillt Visiofl  2010 issued  in  mid-1995. The joint vision guided  the transformation of  new concepts  of  dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full  dimensional projection, and focused logistics into joint operational  capabilities.  The  conceptual  template helped  the  armed

forces  channel  innovation  and  leverage  technology  to  exploit  the  full llffay  of capabilities,  allowing  the joint  tea m  to  dominate  adversaries across  the  ra nge  of  military  operations.  Through  Army  XX I,  the  ser› vice's leaders sought to define the capabilities that the Army would  need to operate in  an operational  environment dominated by information war› fa re,  highly  mobile  forces,  and  more lethal and  precise  weapons. Thus, FY  1995 was a year in  which Army leaders searched for ways to  main› tain  and  stabilize  the  force  so that  it  cont in ued  to  be  responsive  to  the national strategy while  maintaining a vital commitment 10  transforming the Army so that  it  re mains a  force  of  decision  in  the  nex t centu ry.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

Orgal/izational Chal/ges

The position of Deputy  Under Secretary of the Army  was  redesignat› ed on 2 1 July  1995 as Deputy  Under Scactary of the Army  (International Affairs)  (OUSA-IA). The  former  position  was  very  gcnernl  with  no  spe› cific functional  responsibility,  whereas the DUSA-IA is responsible for the oversight of  all international act ivities and affairs for the Department of  the Army.  Reporting directly to the Secretary of  the Army,  the DUSA-IA coor› dinates,  integrates,  and  oversees  all international  act ivities  and  affairs, including those within the functional  responsibility of  other Army officials.

The  DOD underwent  signi ficant  reorganization  during  FY  1995  to improve  management of space  systems. These changes  included  estab› lishment of three  new  offices:  the  Joi nt  Space Management  Board,  the Office  of  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  o f  Defense  (Space),  and  the Office  of the  Department  of Defense  Space  Architect.  The  Chief  of Staff, Army, directed that space management be accomplished in a joint environment and, in  accordance with this directive, thc Army appointed representatives  to  each  of  the ncw  organizations.  The  Joint Space Management  Board,  composed of DOD  senior leaders  and  the  intell i› gence  community,  approves  national  security  space  policy  and  space architectures and  provides  acquisition oversight  for space systems. The Army  members  are  the  Viee  Ch ief  of  Staff,  Army, and the Army Acquisition  Exccutive.  The  Office  of the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of Defense (Space)  is  responsible  for space  policy  formulation  and  staff ovcrsight for space architccturcs and acquisition. Army representation in thi s new  office  consists of  two positions. In the Office  of  the Department of Defense Space Architect, which is responsible for devel› oping various functional  space architectures, the Army  established  five positions. The  following  orgmlizations contributed  manpower bi llets  to establish  these  five  positions: the  Training  and Doctrine  Command (TRADOC); the Space and Strategic  Defense Command; the Office of the  Deputy  Chief of  Staff for  Operations  and  Plans  (ODCSOPS);  the Office of the  Deputy Chief of Stan' for  Intell igcnce;  and  thc  OtTice  of the Dircctor of Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and  Intelligence.

The  Defense Authorization Act for  FY  \994 directed  the creation of an  independent  commission  to  reexamine the  roles  and  missions  of the armed forces  in  light orthe end orlhe Cold  War. The commission was to deliver its report to  Congress and the Secretary of Defense by  May  1995. The Commission 011  the Roles and Missions orlhe Armed Forces first met in May  1994. In June 1994,  Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army (I-I QDA), established a  Roles and  Missions Office in ODeSors. In  July 1994, the  Roles and  Mission Office became the  Directorate of Roles and Missions in ODeSOPS. The missions of  this directorate were to ( I) assess existing and  future Army  roles and  missions, (2) assist  the service's cjvjl~ ian  and  military  leadership  in  identifying  the  critical  issues,  (3)  provide intellectually  defensible  and  doctrinally  sound positions  on  all future Anny roles and missions, and (4) coordinate the actions of  the Army Staff and the Army Secretariat  in  providing support  to  the  Commission on  the Roles and Missions of the Armed  Forces.  The Commission delivered  its report  in May  1995,  and,  in  July 1995,  the  Directorate  of Roles  and Missions  in  ODCSOPS  was  disestablished.  Responsibility  for  oversight and  staff coordination  of  roles  and  missions  questions  reverted  to  the Strategy,  Plans, and  Policy  Directorate of ODCSOPS.

The  Director of Army  Safety established  the  position of Director of Army Radiation Safety  in  January  1995 to consolidate overall  proponency and responsibility  for the  Army's  radiation  protection  program  at the Department of  the Anny level. The Army Inspector General (IG) had iden› tified the need to establish an Army Radiation Safety Program proponency in  HQDA. Major duties assigned to the Director of  Army Radiation Safety included developing Army ionizing and  non-ionizing  radiation  protection pOlicies  and  promoting good  radiation  protection  practices,  chairing  the Army Radiation Protection Coordination Committee, and represcnting the Army on  radiation protection issues in  relations with  non-Army agencies. Pending resolution of  issues concerning the position's  authorizntion and the Tables of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) of its accompanying organi› zation, the Director of  Army Safety designated , I Health  Physics officer, in the grade of  colonel, from the Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, to  perform  duties as  the  Director of Army  Radiation Safety  in the Army Safety Office.

Within  the  Strategy,  Plans,  and Policy  Directorate,  ODCSOPS,  the Nuclear Division was discontinued on  I May 1995. The division's functions were integrated into the directorate's Strategic  Plans and Policy Division.

In  August 1995, the Office  of  the Director  of  Environmental Programs,  in  the  Office  of the  Assistant  Chief of Staff for  Installation Management,  was  reorganized into three  di visions: Environmental Quality; Environmental Readiness; and Strategy, Plans, and Programming.

The U.S. Total  Army Personnel Command's  (PERSCOM)  Force Integration Division  conducted  an internal reorganization in January 1995.  Prior to the reorganization, each bmnch orthe division consisted of force development  officers and system managers who were aligned func› ti onally  wi th  the  branches and  functional  areas  of the  Army.  The  force development officers produced the PcrsOlmei Management Authorization Document,  the  only  document  that  establishes  personnel authorizations for the Army. The system managers analyzed the impact of force structure changes  on  personnel  issues.  The  reorganization  merged  the  dUlies  of force development officers and system managers, and the job title became Force Management Officer. The  reorganization  decreased the size of the Force  Integration  Division  from  twenty-eight  personnel  to  sixteen,  and created  a  more  efficient  organization  in  that  those  who  developed  the Personnel  Management  Authorization  Document  were  responsible  for analyzing its effects on Army personnel.

The Joint  Requirements  Oversight  Council (JROC)  is  a  DOD  instru› ment used to  identify critical  deficiencies,  redundancies, and opportunities in  joint  warrighti ng  mission  areas  that  affect  future  warrighting  require› ments and capabilities. The JROC influences all future warrighting require› ments and capabilities.  Before June  1 995, responsibility  for  JROC mailers was divided among different parts of the Army Staff as an additional  duty. This  approach  placed  the  Army  in  a  reactive  mode  of operation,  which adversely affected the service's ability to contribute to the JROC process.

The Director of  the Army Staff, therefore, approved a concept plan on 5 June  1995  for the establishment of  the JROC division under ODCSOPS, creating a  fu ll-time staff ded icatcd  to JROC  mailers. The JROC division consisted  of I  new  civilian  and  I I  new  military  positions,  and  I  officer and 2 civilian positions transferred internally from  the Force Development Division ofODCSOPS to the JROC division. Funding for the new officer and  civilian  positions  for FY 1996  and  beyond  came  from  the  Force Integration and  Management  Division ofODCSOPS.

In April  1995, the  U.S. Army Information Systems Command and the Air Force Pentagon  Communications  Agency  formed  a new  Single Agency Manager for  Pentagon  Information Technology Services to com› ply with a  1994  DOD directive  to consolidate  management and adminis› tration of common information technology services in  the  Pentagon.

The Army's efforts  to  reduce  unnecessary  infrastructure  began  with the Secretary of Defense's Commission on  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in  1988.  Between  1988  and  1994, the Army closed  77  installa› tions  in  the  United  States  and  more  than  500  sites  overseas.  The  Army reached an  important milestone  for  the  BRAC program  in  1995, closing the  last  of the  installations  scheduled  for  closure  by  the  Secretary  of Defense'S Commission  of  1988:  Cameron  Station,  Virginia,  and  Army

Materials Technology Laboratory, Massachusetts. The year also witnessed approval orthe fina l list of  installations to be closed or realigned under the BRAe Act of 1990.  During  FY  1995,  the service  began  the  process  to implement the twenty-nine closures and cleven realignments recommend› ed by the 1 995  BRAe Commission. These closures and realignments, the Army's largest and most complex reduction ofinfraslruclurc, is estimated to take six  years and cost $2. 1 billion.

Although overseas closures did not  receive  the same publicity  as those in  the  United States, they were extensive and represented the Army's funda› mental strategic shin from a forward-deployed force to an overseas presence and a  power-projection  force.  In  Europe,  the Army  reduced the  number of installations by  67 percent.  By the end of FY  1995, most of the reductions were  complete.  These  necessary  base  closures  and  realignments  caused short-term turbulence but in the long term rcsultcd in a more efficient infra› structure and, ultimately, morc stabili ty  throughout the Army.

## Managemellt In/ ol'mation Systems

The ODCSOPS created the Army Power Projection Operations Center at  Fort  Huachuca,  Ari zona,  to  provide a  clearinghouse and  troubleshoot› ing center for  the Army's communications and automation communities. The center manages the service's internal communications to  improve the manner in  which  information  flows  throughout  the  Army.  In  addition  to monitoring systems and nctworks used by  thc Army around thc world, thc center crcated a  customcr assistancc unit designed  to help identify prob› lems,  rectify as  many as  possible, and  refer the  rest to  a  problem  resolu› tion group.  Besides solvi ng problems, the center remotely collects perfor› mance  and  status  information  from  telecommunications  networks  and automated systems and provides analysis and guidance.

The Community and  Family Support  Center (CFSC) distributed  five computcr-based  management  systcms  to  Nonappropriatcd  Fund  (NAF) and  Morale, Wclfare, and  Recreation (MWR) activities worldwide during FY  1995. Fielding of  the Time Labor Managemcnt System, the NAF work force  management  system,  was  completed  to  147  locations  worldwide. The  Financial  Management  and  Budget  System  was  fielded  to  eighty› three  locations  worldwide  during the year.  This system  is ,I development tool  for  NAF's annual  budget.  The  Recrcational Tracking  System, which provides facility and activity reservation and registration, league and tour› nament  managcment,  and  a  pOint-of-salc  systcm  for  rentals  and  snack bars, was fielded 10 eightloc31ions worldwide. Chi ld development ccnters and sixty-three other  locations worldwide  received the version 2.4 upgrade  of  the  Child  Development  Services  Automated  Management System. The development  of version  3.0 began in August  1995.

Economies, Efficiencies,  and Managemellf  Improvement

During  FY 1995,  all major  Army  commands  (MACOM)  worked  on rccnginecring  and  redesign  initiatives  that  would  institutionalize  the  best methods  of managing org'lI1izational change. The  service  worked  directly with  DOD and other fedcml  agencies,  addressing speci fic cost-culling  ini› tiatives, sllch as streamlining the \VOrk  Force, improving service,  implement› ing  acquisition  reform,  and  reducing  regulations  in  accordance  with  the ongoing  National Performance Review. One  provision of  the National I )c rf ormancc  Review chartered  reinvention  laboratories to allow agencies to lest new ways of  doing business.  In  FY  1995, the Army intensified its efforts in this area by increasing the number of  reinvention labs.  More significantly, the Army created the only IwO reinvention centers within the DOD, onc each at TRADOC and at  Forces Command (FORSCOM). The commanders of the rei nvention centers had broad powers to establish their own reinvention labs, to waive regulations to further reinvention, and to coordinate directly with the DOD regarding legislative changes necessary to support  rei nvention.

In  August  1994,  the  Secrctary  of the  Army  approved  a  new  policy enabling  installation  comm;mders  to  request  waivers  of Army  or  DOD regulations or policy directives that  impede good business practices. This policy, part  of the  Army's efforts  to  implement  National Performance Review initiatives, will allow installations to develop innovative and more efficient  management and administrative systems.  On  23  May  1995, the Secretary  of Defense  signed  a  memorandum  to  streamline  the  waiver request process and allow DOD reinvention labs and centers to send waiv· er requests directly 10  the appropri ate functional proponent.  The Office of the  Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  for  Resource  Analysis  and Business  Practices,  Office  of the  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  for Financial  Management  and  Comptroller (OASA  [FM&amp;C]),  is  the  action office for all financ ial managcment- related waiver requests.  Army resource managers have been encouraged to send waivcr requests directly to  thi s office for expeditious  handling. The Secretary of the Army on  14 August  1995 extended to Army reinvention  labs and centers the authority to  waive Army regulations and directives.

In FY  1995, the  Business Practices Directorate, Office of  the  Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  for  Resource  Analysis  and  Business Practices, processed 39 separate requests for a regulatory waiver, of  which 12 resulted  in  the approval  of 10 separate  waivers;  8 were  withdrawn  by the originating  commands; 4 did  not involve  prohibitive  regulations and were  resolved  without  using  Ihe  waiver  process;  4  were  transferred  to other  Army  functional  proponents;  and  I  was  based  in  public  law  and could not be  waived. As FY  1995 came to a close, len requests for a wahl. er were still  being processed.

A  provIsion  of the  Chief  Financial  Officers  Act  of  1990  required financial statements and an independent audit opinion for revolving funds, trust  funds,  and  substantially commercial  functions. The Army,  as one of only ten  federal  agencies designated as a pilot  project under this law,  has prepared audited annual  fi nancial  statements since FY  1991  covering all Army funds.  In  March  1995. the Army  submitted its financial  report  for FY  1994.  The  report  consisted  of a  financial statement prepared by the Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service's Indianapolis  Center  and  an overview prepared by HQDA ofkey Army missions and the service's per· formance  in FY  1994. Under the Government  Management  Reform Act of 1994, all  agencies covered by the Chief Financial  Officers Act will  be required to have agency-wide financil. 11  statements, beginning in  FY  1996.

The Army  established  a  senior-level  Efficiency  Working  Group  to develop  methods  to  save  money  because, during  the  Program  Objective Memorandum (POM) 97- 01  update,  it  became  obvious  that  the  service could  not  sustain  essential  modernization,  improve  quality  of life,  and maintain end strength of 495,000 active duty personnel and  sti ll conduct business as usual. The working group began a review of policies and pro› cedures to  identify potential efficiencies, with  the goal  of generating sig› ni f icant savi ngs etlch year by driving down the cost of  doing business, pre› serving  constrained  resources,  and  continuing  to  adopt  sound  busincss practices. The Army Audit Agcncy and  the Cost and  Economic Analysis Center  revicwed  proposals  developed  by  the  working  group,  and  those proposals approved by the Army's senior leaders will be implemented.

Created  in  1970,  the  Select Commiuee (SELCOM) was  for  twenty› five  years  the  sen ior  committee  in  HQ DA  for  review,  coordination,  and integration of  the Army's  Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES) actions. The committee reviewed Army poli› cy, plans, programs, and budgets, including the pcrformance of programs and the financial cxecution of budge  IS.  SELCOM referred issues of major importance to the Secretary of  the Army and the Chief of  Staff, Army, pre› senting,  as  appropriate,  alternatives  and  recommendations  for  decision. With  twenty-eigln  members,  SELCOM  was a  large group  composed  of the assistant secretaries of the Army. the deputy chiefs of starr, and all  of the other principal  officials  of HQDA. The  Under Secretary of the Army and the Vice Chief of Starr, Army, co-chaired the committee.

During the  slimmer of 1995,  the  Secretary of the Army  determined thaI  the  Army  needed  a  more  effective  process  for  resou rce  a llocation. Rather than  merely  endorsing  or adjusting  final  products,  the  Secretary believed that senior leaders should be involved  in  the framing and assess› ment  of alternatives.  Also,  the  decision-making  body  should  be  more streaml ined  than  SELCOM.  On  20  July,  the  Secretary  announced  the abolishment of SELCOM and  the  establishment  or the Army  Resources

Board (ARB). The ARB was now the senior-level forum in  HQDA for the review of  Army policy and resource allocation issues, making it  the  final decision  authority  regarding  policy,  plans,  programs,  and  budgets.  The Secretary of the Army serves as chair of the ARB and  the Chief of SlafT, Army,  as  vice  chair.  The  other  members  of the  ARB arc  the Under Secretary  of the  Army;  the  Vice  Chief of  Staff,  Army;  four  Assistant Secretaries  of the  Army  (for  Financial  Management  and  Comptroller; Installati ons, Logisti cs, and  Environment; Manpower and Reserve Affai rs; and  Research,  Development, and  Acquisition); and  the  Deputy Chief of Siaff  for  Operations  and  Plans.  The  Special  Assistant  to  the  Assistant Secretary for Financial Management and Comptrol ler serves as Executive Secretary. The  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Army  Budget  and  the Director, Program Analysis and  Evaluation, provide support  to ARB.

Shortly after ARB was chartered, the ARB Support Group was found› ed to enable leaders in the Army Secretariat and the Army StafTto oversee j ointly the  PPBES and support the ARB processes. This group's role is  to identi fy  emerging problems in planning, program development, and  bud› get formulat ion, and then resolve the problems or refer issues and recom› mendations  to  the  ARB.  All issues  considered  by  the  ARB  are first reviewed by the ARB Support Group. When consideration of  issues would benefit from a broader exchange of information  within  HQDA, the group is  to  convene  with  an  expanded  membership  and  be  called  the  ARB Support  Group-Ad Hoc.

The chair of the ARB  Support  Group  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  for Financial  Management and Comptroller.  Membership ofthe ARB Support Group consists of the Assistant  Secretary for  Installations,  Logistics, and Environment; the Assistant  Secretary for  Manpower and  Reserve AlTairs; the Assistant Secretary  for  Research,  Development, and Acquisition; the Director of Information Systems for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers; the General Counsel; the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and  Plans (DCSOPS);  the Special  Assistant to  the Assistant Secretary for Financial Managcment  and  Comptrol ler;  the Deputy  Assistant Secrctary  for Army  Budget; and  the  Director,  Program Analysis  and  Evaluation.  The  ARB  Support  Group- Ad  Hoc  adds  the Director  of  the  Army  StafT;  the  Deputy  Chief  of  StafT  for Logistics (DCSLOG);  the  Deputy  Chief of StafT  for  Personnel  (DCSPER);  the Director,  ARNG;  the  Chief,  USAR; and  the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management.

The Antideficiency Act (ADA) is a series of laws under Title 31 of  the United  States  Code  that  enforce  restrictions  Congress  placed  on  funds issucd  to the executivc agencies. Specifically,  the laws require that feder› al  employees not obligatc funds they do not have and do O bligate funds for purposes other than those stated in  the authorizations and appropriations

OI et.  [n  FY 1995, the Army continued its efforts to close out overdue cases and  to  emphasize  ADA  awareness.  The  service  had twcnty~fjvc ADA cases at  the start  of  FY  1995; another nine cases were rcported during the year.  By  year's end,  twenty-eight cases  had  been  resolved,  reducing  the year-end balance to six cases. Although the Army reduced  its backlog of ADA cases, the service conlinues to seck improvements in  the conduct of ADA investigations. The Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Operations) coordinated the development of  ADA  inves› tigator training software with the Defense Business Management University. When  fielded, this  training software  will  provide  a  means  to trai n investigators at their horne stations, giving the Army a way to provide fiscal law tra ining in  the  fi eld.

On  I  October  1991,  the  Office  of the  Under  Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller)  (OUSD[C])  assumed  the  responsibility  for  cash  managc› mcnt  when the  Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) combined the military departments' industrial and stock funds  into one revolving fund. Aner three years of  experience, OUSD(C) determined it  would  be benefI› cial for the  military departments to h,lVe concurrent responsibi lity for both cost  management  and  cash  management.  Consequently,  in  November 1994,  OUSO(C)  announced  that cash  managemcnt  rcsponsibi lity  would be delegated, and, in  February  1995, the Department ofthc Army assumcd rcsponsibility for  its share of DBOF cash, amounting to $346 million.

The Army maintains an appropriate cash balance, known as the "cash corpus,"  at  the  headquarters  level  to  cover  net  business outlays  (collec› tions minus disbursements).  In early  1995,  projections  indicated  that  the cash corpus would drop below acceptable levels by March  1995, violating the  ADA,  under Title  31 of  the  United  States Code.  In  February  1995, soon aner the Army received the  responsibility  for cash management, the Assistant Secretary of  the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) directed  that the Army adopt  the practice of  "advance bi ll ing" customers, that  is,  charging  them  in  advance  of actual  work  performed.  Billing  in advance  was  a  temporary  measure  that staved off an ADA  violation and proved  essential  to  ongoing  DBor operations  because  Door activities operatc on a rcvolving fund basis, selling goods and services to customers who provide cash needed to  fund  ongoing operations.

In an effort to  strengthen  cash  management  competencies, the Army engaged the services of a private  accounting  firm  to  provide educational materials  and  training.  The  firm  conducted  classroom  training  for  189 Anny employees in May and June  1995 and also produced a valuable cash management reference guide.

In  December  1994, OASA (FM&amp;C) published requirements and  pro› cedures for the participation of USAR and the ARNG  officcrs in  the Army Comptrollership Program (ACP) at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New

York.  This pilot  program  will  provide the National  Guard  Bureau (NGB) and the Office of  the Chief, Army Reserve, an additionalmcans of devcl~ oping  and  maintaining  a  core  of highly trai ned, professional  miliHlry comptrollers and to ensure avai lability of the ACP  to all Army members. The ACP emerged from  a  growing awareness by the OASA (FM&amp;C), as the  functional  proponent,  of the  need  to  ensure  that  USAR  and  ARNG officers on  extended full-t ime active duty  tours and serving  in  comptrol› ler  posit ions  were  ful ly qualified  to perform their dut ies.  In  June  J 995, a USAR  officer enrolled  in  the  ACP class  of \996,  becoming  the  reserve components  first ACP student.

[n  lin  elTort  to  provide  commanders  the  nexibility  to  generate addi~ tional  runds,  maximize  usc  or resources,  and  manage  in  the  most  busi› nesslike  fashion  possible,  OASA  (FM&amp;C)  submitted  several  legislative proposals  that  werc enacted  in  FY  1995 and will  take effect  in  FY  1996. One  such  propos&lt;li  was  the Expensellnvestment  Threshold measure, which g&lt;lve  installation  commanders increased  flexibility to use the  most cost-effective method to meet mission requirements by raising the opera› tions  and  maintenance  purchase  thresholds  from  $50,000  to  $ 100,000. Without  this  flexibility,  commanders  arc  sometimes  forccd  to  maintain aged equipment or lease new equipment at cumulative costs far in  excess of purchasc  prices  for  replacing  the  equipment.  Also  enacted  was  thc Acceptance of Nongovernmental  Cash Awards measure to allow installa› tions  and  activities  to  retain  and  expend  cash  awards  from  nongovern› mental  entities.  This  proposal  was  submitted  in  direct  response  to  the "Innovations  in Government"  awards  program  sponsored  by  the  Ford Foundation. Nongovcrnmental cash awards will be deposited and used as nonappropriated funds for the benefit of  soldiers and their fam ilies on the winning instal lations.

The  Federal  Managers' Financial  Integrity Act of  1982  and the OfTice of  Managemcnt and Budget's  Circular AJ  23  require each executive agency to  conduct  periodic  evaluations  of management  controls  and  to  provide ullnu&lt;l1  statements to the president and Congress that assess the effectiveness of  these controls and identify any material weaknesses in them.  In FY  1995, OASA  (FM&amp;C) restructured  the  Army's management  control  process  to reduce worklo&lt;ld and increase the flexibility and accountability of  comman› ders and managers; commanders and managers now decide how to ev"luate their controls,  using  either st reamlined checklists or existing  management review processes. This restructuring reduced the number of  required evalu› ations  from  450 to  140. The Army's goal is  to embed these evaluations  in day-to-day management processes wherever possible.

This new management control process requires MACOMs and HQDA sta ff agencies  to  segment  thcmselves  into  "assessable  units"  headed  by senior managers no lower than colonel/GS- 15 (at garrisons, no lower th&lt;ln

the  senior functional chiefs,  regardless of grade).  MACOMs and  HQDA slafT agencies have designated about 3,000 assessable unit managers, who must certify  the  results  of management control evaluations.  In addition, MACOMs and HQDA siaff agencies now decide  when  10 conduct  these evaluations, establishing their own five-year schedules.

In August  1995, the Army expanded  its training efforts to explain and emphasize the imporlance of management controls and the new manage› ment  control  process  by  providing  training  packages,  videotapes,  and  a detailed  handbook  for  ils  management control administrators; offering a new one-day management control course; integrating management control instruction  into other Army schools and courses; and conducting an annu› al Army  management control  conference.  The  Army's training  program also emphasized the  need  for  full  disclosure  of material weaknesses and proper validation of  corrective  actions.

The  Army's  Joint Reconciliation Program  combincs  the  financial skil ls of  accounting and budgct pcrsonnel with the expertise of  acquisition spccialists,  logisticians,  auditors,  and  legal  staffs  in  creating  horizontal teams  to analyze  payments  that  do  not  match  obligations on  the  books. These  disbursements  are  of major concern  within  the  DOD  because,  if they are not resolved in a timely manner, current-year funds must  be used to  pay  bi ll s  from  previous  years. In  FY  1995,  the  Joint  Rcconciliat ion Program  reduced  Army  unmatched  disbursements  from  $750  mi llion  to $368 million; negative unliquidated obligations from $500 million to $ 1 48 mi llion;  and  contingent  liabilities  associated  with  canceling  appropria› tions  from  $539  million  to  $23  million.  MACOMs  reportcd  that  their experience with the Joint  Reconciliation Program led to  improvements in execution  of current-year obligation  authority.  The  Joint  Reconciliation Program also precluded the diversion of  current-year funds from essential expenditures in support  ofmititary readiness.

1 11 FY  1995, onc out of  evcry four soldicrs who separated from active duty  owcd  a  debt  to  the  Army.  Overpaymcnt of pay,  allowanccs, entitle› ments,  leave,  bonuses, transportation  costs, and  travel  advances,  and  lia› bility  for  lost or damaged government property caused these debts. These debts are difficult  to  collect after soldiers leave active du ty, and  the costs to  collect (about $38 million  in Operation and Maintcnance, Army,  funds in FY  1995)  often  exceed  thc  amounts  recovercd. The  Army's 325,605 new  debt cases  totaled  $88  million  in  FY 1995.  To  bring  this  problem under control, OASA (FM&amp;C) and the Office of  the Deputy Chief of StafT for  Personnel (ODCSPER),  with  assistance  from  PERSCOM, worked to idcntify  policy  or  procedural  changes,  wi th  a  focus  on  debt  avoidance. Ncw clearance  procedures  were  tested  at  Fort  Myer, Virginia,  with  very favorable  results. The  new  clearance procedures  were  refined  and a  new separation checklist was developed. An Army-wide test of the  new  sepa-

ration checklist  (DA Form 137- R  [Test])  will be conducted  from I November 1995 through  I  May  1996.

During FY  1995, the Army Audit Agency issued 412 reports,  including forma l audit  reports, consulting reporls, memorandum reports, and adviso· ry  reports.  These  audits  resulted  in  potential  monetary  benefits  of about $2.4  billion.  One audit  found  that  many installations were not applying for fuel  tax refunds because Army guidance on fuel  tax  refunds was inadequate and  major  commands  v"ere  not  monitoring  refund  claims  to  make  sure installations  riled  them.  The  aud itors  recommended  that  installations  file refund claims as often as  possible in  accordance with  federal and state reg› ulations, and that the service provide installations'l handbook developed by the Army Audit Agency for  their  use  in  processing and supporting claims. Army managers agreed with  these  recommendations,  which  had  potential monetary benefits of$21.  7 million.  In another audit the auditors found  that the Army  could  save  about  $69  million  ($12  million  for  the ARNG  and about $57 million  for the active Army) ovcr the next six  years by  allowing installations and activities  to  purchase  vehicle batteries from  local  vendors instead of  ordering them through the Army supply system. By doing so, the Army could avoid environmental problems associated with the storage and disposal of  used batteries. Moreover, local purchases might  actually enhance equipment readiness because the vendors could  furnish  bettcr bat› teries in a timelier manner than the Army supply system. The Army agreed with the recommendations and the potential  monetary benefits.

The FY  1995 budget request for $61.1  billion in total obligation author› it y  was only $ 100  million more than for FY  1994. Taking into account  that accommod.ltions had to be made for $1.3 billion in price increases from  FY 1994  to  FY  1995. the Army's buying power had aChl&lt;llly declined  by more than  2  percent. The budget  incre,lsed  substantially  operations  and  mainte› nancc  funding and was  consistent with established Defense Planning Guidance priori tics  for  readiness and sllstainability, force  structure, science and  technology, systems acquisition, and infrastructure. Table  I summarizes appropriations for  the FY  1995 budget and the FY  1996 budget request.

The FY  1995 budget  provided  for  end  strengths  of 510,000  for  the active  component,  400,000  for  the  ARNG,  and  242,000  for  the  Army USAR. The budget continued to  fund  the Voluntary Separation  Incentive Pay (VSIP)  program,  the  Special  Separation Benefit,  and the Early Retirement  Program (ERP)  for  military  personnel. The  FY  1995  budget also provided for civilian personncJ end strength of281 ,000, and a 1.6 per› cent pay increase for military and civilian personnel also was contained in the  FY  1995 budget.

The  FY  1995  budget  submission  maintained  readiness  at  an  opera› tional  tempo of 800 mi les per year for major ground combat systems and 14.5  flying  hours  per ai rerew  per month  for  the  active  force.  The  budget provided for seventy-seven battalion rotations through the CTCs. Increased funding for ammunition management, pre-positioning of  equip› ment and  materiel on  land  and  sea abroad,  movement  of equipment and supplies within the United States and overseas, and the depot maintenance program supported the Army's ability to sustain combat  and contingency operations.

Funding  for  the  FY  1995  Military Construction  Progrnm  reflected  1.1 decision to  limit investments in  new and renovated facilities due to  ullcer-

taintics about  fllturc  force  structure  and  existing  in frast ruct ure  inventory. Construction was requested  for  only those  fac ilities affecting  the Army's performance of critical  mission requirements relating to strategic  mobili› ty.  chemical demilitariz.1tion, Panama Canal Treaty implementation, envi› ronmental  compliance,  and  health  and  safely.  Funding  for  major  con› struction requi rements at  installations  in Korea, Japan, and  Europe was to be obtained through a combination of bilateral  negotiations with the host nations  and  shared  fu nding,  rather  than  direct  funding.  For  the  Family '- lousi ng  Program,  the  FY 1995  budget  requested  fundi ng  for  the  con› struction of989 new housing units. It was considered more economical to replace, rather than  renovate, older housing units.

Maintaining  a  high-qualifY force  within  the  Army's current  budget constraints  will  require  difficult  choices  between  operational  readiness today  and  needed  investments  in  modernization  and  readiness  for  the future.  The  service's modernization  strategy  for  FY 1995  focused  on selective upgrades of existing  capabi lities  and,  when  necessary,  replace› ment's of technically obsolcte assets with new, more capable systems.  By continuing  the  upgrades  of  the  Abrams  tank  and  the  Bradley  Fighting Vehicle, the budget supported  directly the  initiative to digi tize  the  batt le› rield. Funding continued for the procurement of  sixty UH- 60 Black Hawk helicopters and  the  Hellfire  II  missi le system, a th ird gencration ai rborne antitank  weapon;  thc  modernization  of the AI'I- 64A  Apache  helicopter; and  the  upgrade  of the  O H- 58A  and  O H- 58D helicopters  to  the  armed Kiowa Warrior OH- 58D configuration. The FY  1995 budget also provid› ed adequate ammunition for  training the  reduced number of units follow› ing  force  structure ClltS,  a llowed procu rement of  advanced  120-mm. tank main gun rounds, and supported a reduction of  the backlog in ammunition demi litarization.

Thc FY  1995 budget affirmed  the Army's need  for  improvements  in its  tactical  transportation  capability.  This  need  was add ressed  by conti nu› ing  the  multiyear  procurcment  of two  critical  Army  requircmcnts:  the High  Mobility  Multipurpose Whceled Vehicle (J-I MMWV) and the  fam i› ly  o f  Heavy Tactical  Vehiclcs  Palletized  Load  System.  The  budget  also supp0rled improvement of  the fam ily of  Medium Tactical Vehicles and the High Mobi lity Trailer programs.

Because  of budget  constraints,  the  Army  terminated  reluctantly  a number of programs in  FY  1995, including  the  Multiple  Launch  Rocket System, the  l20-mm.  mortar  program, and  the  Avenger air defense sys› tem. The Sense and  Destroy Armor program was maintained in a standby status during the fiscal ycar, but the Army continued to conduct a detailed review of relevant  rcqui rcments  and  technical capabil itics and  cxamined alternative tec hnologies. In the Research, Development,  Test, and Evaluation area,  the  FY  1995  budget continued to  provide  for  the devel-

apmenl of the RAH- 66 Comanche's advanced T800 engine and the man~ ufacturc  of a  prototype  helicopter.  Also  continued  under  development were  various  antitank systems,  including  the Longbow  Hellfire  and Javelin  missi le systems and the Brilliant antitank submunition.

Historically. contingency operations have been funded from  third and fourth  quarter Operation and  Maintenance, Army,  monies,  in  hopes that Congress  would  later  provide  supplemental  appropriations.  Money  for unfunded  contingency  operations  came  from  readiness  activities  and, unless  that  money was  replaced,  the Army's readiness  posture  would  suf· fer. In FY 1994, contingency operations that developed during the last two quarters  without supplemental  appropriations resulted  in  lower readi ness ratings  for  th ree of the Army's combat divisions.  A United Nations 1110ra› toriu m  on  the  reimbursement  for  goods  and  services  for  peacekeeping operations furt her exacerbated the problem.

The  Army  was  involved  in  various  peacekeeping  and  contingency operations during  FY  1995. The  tolal  cost  to  the  Army  for  these opera› tions,  $844.6 mi ll ion,  included  charges to  Ihe  military  personnel, opera› tion and maintenance, and  procurement appropriations.  Major operations in  which IhcArmy was involved ineluded Yugoslavia (at a cost of$34 mil› lion), VIGILANT WARRIOR in Kuwait  (at  a  cost  of  $ 14 1.6 million), SOUTHERN WATCII  in southern Iraq (at a cost of$90.7 million), Rwanda (al a cosi of$32.9 million), UPIIOLD  DEMOCRACY  in  Haiti (at a cost of $4 17.6 million), Uniled Nations Mission in  Haiti (UNMI H) (at a cost of$52 mi l› lion),  and Cuban  Refugee  Operations  (at  a  cost  of  $55.3 million). Recognizing Ihal the cost of  these operations was in excess of  normal mil› itary functions,  Congress in April  1995 provided the DOD $990.1  million in  supplemental  funds  for  these and  other requirements  1 0  preserve  and enhance military readiness.

The Army developed its total obligation authority request for FY  1996 within  the  framework  of the  DOD's vision of the three challenges facing the military:  managing the usc of  the military force  in the post- Cold  War era,  preventing  the  reemergence  of the  nuclear threat, and  managing  Ihc reduction  in  force.  This  request  for  FY 1996  reflects  a  balance  among competing demands for limited resources, and will provide adequate fund› ing  for operational  training,  programs  to  recruit  and  retain  high-qua lity personnel,  improve  strategic  mobility,  and  pre-position  equipment  and supplies  for  contingency operations. As  in  past years, additional  funding will  be requi red  to accomplish any unforeseen  missions.

The  Regular  Army's  end  strength  under  the FY 1996  request  is 495,000,  a  drop  of  15,000  from  the  FY 1995  strength.  ARNO's end strength  is  373,000,  a  rcduction  of 14,000  from  the  FY  1995  strength. USAR's end strength of  230,000 is 12,000 less than the FY  1995 strength. The  servicc's civilian  workforce  in  FY 1996  will  be  reduced  by  about

12,600 to end strength of257,059. These reductions will  be accomplished through  normal  attrition,  early  retirements,  and  separation  incentives; reduction-ill-force procedures wi ll  be used only as a last  resort.

The FY  1996 request provides for an active component training tempo of 800  miles  per  yea r  for  combat  vehicles  and  1 4.5  fly ing  hours  each month  for aircrews.  For the ARNG,  the  respective  figures arc  213  mi les and 7. 1 fly ing  hours; the  USAR training tempo is 200  miles and  8. 1 fly› ing hours, respectively.  Also in the request are funds for thi rty-two brigade rotations at  the Army's three maneuver CTCs.

The Army's modernization strategy  focuses on  long-term  technology that  creates  overmatch capabilities  against  any  potential  th reat.  Limited modernization resources, however, prohibit any large investments. Therefore,  the  Army  will  purchase  a  limited  number  of new  weapons, extend the  lives and  improve the capabilities of  selected existing systems, and terminate procurcmcnt and support  funding for programs that  provide only marginal improvements  in  sustaining  the  service's combat  capabili› ties. The FY  1996 Research, Development, and Acquisition rcqucst is for $ 12.2  bi ll ion,  a decrease of 39  perccnt since  FY  1989. This  request  pro› vidcs  upgrades  for Abrams  tanks,  Bradley  Fighting  Vchicles,  and  M I  09 medium  howitzers,  and  complctes  procurement  of the  Army  Tactical Missile System. Entcring production during FY  1996 will be the Armored Gun System,  thc  I -I  cavy Assault  Bridge, and  the  Longbow  Hellfire  mis› sile.  Army aviation  will  see  upgrades  to  the Apache  and  Kiowa  Warrior helicopters.  Advanced  120-mm. tank ammunition  and "smart"  155-mm. howitzer munitions are  funded for  low-rate  production.

Quarters for single soldiers and family  housing arc the pri mary  focus of  q uality-of-life improvements in the FY 1996 request.  Major projects of the Whole  Barracks  Renewal  Program  during FY  1996 include  improve› ments at seven posts in  the continental United Stales (CONUS) and reno› vation  of barracks in  Korea.

The Army  POM update  for  FYs  1997 to  200 1 was  forwarded to  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in June  1995. This update con› ti nued  the  funding efforts  from  POM  96--0 1 and  addressed  issues  raised in the  program review and budget development subsequent to that POM ' s submission. The  basic  themes  that  shaped  resource  decisions  for  POM 96-0 I  also  drove  the  decision  process  for  the  update.  These  themes incl uded confronting a period of uncertain change, dealing with compet› ing requi rements, and meeting the continuing need for a trained and ready force. The challenge was to build a balanced and executable program.

The  force  structure  and  end  strength supported  by POM  96-0 I reflected the Bouom Up Review and Defense Planning Guidance levels of ten  active  component  divisions  and  end  strength  of 495,000  personnel. The Army believed it  would have obtained these force goals by the end of

FY  1996.  OSD, however,  directed  that  the  active  force  be  reduced  by  an additional  20,000 personnel. This added reduction  was  programmed  into the  97- 01 POM  update.  The  "aITordability  crisis"  that  underscored  Ihe development  of POM  96-0 I  continued  in  the  prcp&lt;lralion  of the  POM 97- 0 I  update. One  result  was  that  readiness  and  sustainability,  which shared fi rst  priority to execute  the Army's power-projection strategy, were programmed at the expense of science and technology and force modern› ization. These programs were further constrained in  the 97- 0 I update. As a  rul e,  only  those  systems  that  provided  technological leaps  rather  than incremental  improvements were programmed for procurement.

## Personnel

## Army Strength

AI the end of FY  1995  the strength of the active Army was 508,559. There were 82,539 officers, 422,073 enlisted personnel, and 3,947 cadets on the rolls at the fiscal  year's  close. This was a reduction of about 32,000 from  the  FY  1994 final  end strength.  Women  constituted  \3.4  percent of the active Army, and minorities constituted 38.2 percent.

The strength  of the ARNG  was 374,930, a  reduction of about  22,000 from  the  FY  1994 final  end strength. The ARNG had 43,37 1 officers and 33 1,559 enlisted personnel. Women constituted 8.2  percent orlhe ARNG, and  minorities 20.3 percent.

The strength  orthe USAR  was  24 1,300, a reduction oLlbout  19,000 from  the  FY  1994 final  end  strength. The  USAR  had 49,742 officers and 191,558  enlisted  personnel. Women  constituted  22.3 percent  of  the USAR, and minorities 32.7 percent.

## Enlisted Personnel

The  Regular Army  was  on  track  to  achieve  its  FY  1995  recruiting objcctive of accessioning 63,000 personnel, but stopped  recruiting when the accession  level  reached  62,931  personnel.  This action  was  necessary to  help alleviate a shortfall  in the  Military Pay, Army, accou nt and to  meet the Army's lowered  end  strength  level.  Of the  62,93 1 soldiers  recruited, 95.6 percent possessed high  school diplomas, 69.4  percent scored  in  the highest  test  score  categories  of the Armed  Services Vocational  Aptitude Battery, and  less than 2 percent scored in the lowest category. The results of the  Regular Army's recruiting actions are shown in Table  2.

USAR  exceeded  its  FY  1995  recruiting goal  of 47,732  with 48,098 accessions. Slightly more than 95  percent of  the recruits were high school graduates,  75  percent  scored  in  the  highest  test  score  categories  of the Armed Services Vocational  Aptitude  Battery, and 2 percent  scored in  the lowest  category. The  results  of USAR's recruiting  actions  arc  shown  in Table 3.

ARNG recruited 56,7 11  personnel in FY  1995, not quite achieving its goal of 60,649.  Of those recruited,  81.9  percent were  high school  gradu› ates, 54. 1 percent scored in  the highest test score categories of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, and 2.2 percent scored  in the  lowest category.  Of the  enlistees,  63.3  percent  (35,925)  had  prior  military  ser› vice, and  36.7 percent (20,786) had no  previous  military experience. The results of  ARNG's recruiting actions arc shown  in Table 4.

Although  the  active  Army  achieved  its  FY 1995  enlistment  goals, challenges lay ahead.  Fiscal year 1995 was the last year of reduced acces› sions  in  support  of the  personnel drawdown.  Beginning  in  FY  1996  the active  Army' s  enlistment  gmll will  be  about  90,000  yearly,  but  surveys taken between 1989 and  1994 showed a 39 percent drop in young people's inclination to enlist  in  the armed  forces.  In response to this challenge,  an additional 250 active Army recruiters were added in  FY  1995.

The retention of high-quality soldiers,  particularly those in  their first term  of service,  is  an  important  contribution  to  the  Army's personnel readiness.  Equally important  is  the  retention of the skills and  experience

of soldiers  leaving  the  active  force  through  their  affiliation  with  reserve component  units.  In FY  1995,  the Army reenlisted  19,960 first-term sol› diers,  104  percent of  its goa l, and 23,358 mid-career soldiers,  100 percent of its gOrll.  A total  of  13,737  separating  soldiers  were  assigned  to  the reserve componcnls8,4 13 to the ARNG and 5,324 to USAR105  per› cent  orthe Army's goal.

Implementation  of the  indefinite  reenlistment  program  was  delayed until  the  FY  1996 congressional  session. This program will  allow  select· cd career soldiers to  serve for an unspecified period  upon reenlistment at the  discretion  of the  Secretary  of the  Army.  Army  Regulation  601 - 280, The Army Retentioll Program, was revised in  FY  1995. The regulation now covers transfers  from  the Regular Army to the ARNG and the USAR, and Illany reenlistment procedures were simplified.

In  FY  1995, the active Army's enlisted  strength decreased by  27,000 soldiers as  part  of the  continuing  post- Cold  War reduction.  The  Army's drawdown program met both DOD and congressional guidance to use vol· untary separations to the utmost while protecting readiness &lt;Hld  maintain· ing a high·quality force. In reducing the size of  its enlisted force, the Army during FY  1 995 used only voluntary separation  programs.

The  Voluntary  Early Transition  Program,  the  VSIp,  and  the  Special Separation Benefit al lowed the service to target Regular Army soldiers in overstrength  occupational specialties  and  overstrength  year  groups.  The Army does not plan to use signi ficant voluntary separation incentives after FY  1995. The ERP allowed the Army to offer early retirement to selected soldiers in  excess grades and skills who had at  least  fifteen, but  less than twenty, years of service. The Army will continue to use ERP through FY 1999  for  sergeants  with  more  than  eighteen  years  of service  who  have been  barred  from  reenlistment or who  have  declined  continued  service. Table 5 summarizes losses from  these programs.

In March  1995, DeSPER approved the establishment of  transition pro› cessing  centers in Europe. Rcprescnullivcs from U.S. Army,  Emope, TRADOC, and the Army Staff formed an action learn to redesign ancl  syn› chronize  personnel,  transportation,  retirement,  veterans  affairs,  and  other transition services in  Europe. These Imnsilion centers provide prcscparalion and  retirement  briefings on entitlements to  soldiers  separating or retiring from  the  Anny al  the end of thei r lOUrs  of  duty.  The  soldiers  also  receive their separation and retirement documents at the centers. A total of  nineteen transition-processing centers were ol&gt;cned in Europe. The primary centers in Germany are  located  at  Mannheim,  Baumholder,  Kitzingen, Vilscck,  and Hanau. A  full-time transition ccnter is also located in  Vicenza,  Italy.  These centers are expected to  handle  thc  estimated  8,500  Europe-based  soldiers who will  be  discharged  annually. Three  transition  processing centers  also were opened in  the Republic of Korea: at Yongsan Army Garrison in Seoul, at  Camp Casey in Tongduchon, and at  Camp Henry in Taegu. These centers will provide service to  an estimated  1,800  Korea-based  soldiers  separated annually  from  the  Army.  The  opening  of the  transition  centers  overseas eliminated the delay and inconvenience to soldiers and their Families of an intermediate stop at  a transition center in the United St,ltes before proceed› ing to  their home of record 01' other final  dest ination.  Separating and  retir› ing soldiers assigned  to  remote  locations in  Europe and  Panama  will  con› tinue to  process through  Fort Jackson, South  Carolina.

PERSCOM's Enlisted  Personnel  Management  Directorate  (EPMD) developed five  initiatives in  FY  1995 designed to enhance communiclltion between PERSCOM and soldiers. The goal of  this action was to have sol› diers  become  more  involved  in  the assignment  process and  in  the  man› agement of their careers.

The first  init iative was the activation of  an  interacti ve  voice response te lephone system that gave soldiers access to pcrsonnel and training in for› mation. The  EPMD uses the system to provide automated assignment  and Army schools  information  twenty-four  hours a  day  to soldiers.  Soldiers stationed in CONUS access the automated telephone system via a toll-free telephone  number.  Soldiers  stationed  overseas  can  access  the  system through thc  Defcnse  Data Network.

The second init iative was the installation of facsimi le machines in  all career branches within  EPMD.  Soldiers  and  personnel  offices save time

by  transmitting communications through the facsimile  machines directly to  the  appropriate branch  for  processing.  The third  initiative  was the  lISC ofcleclronic mail (e-mai l) as a means for the rapid exchange of inform  a› lion  between  the  soldier and  the career  branch. To  encourage soldiers to usc e-mail, the user identification  for each  branch  was changed  to reflect the branch's tit le so that soldiers could easily identify their career branch. The fourth inilj&lt;l,ivc was the use of  mailgrams to forward important career management information directly to soldiers at their units'  addresses. This allows  EPMD  10  communicate  with  individual  soldiers  on  a  personal basis,  ensuring  that  soldiers  receive  timely  notification of isslics that  arc important  to  them  and  their  fam ily  members. The  last  initiative  was  the distribution  of II wallet-sized  information  curd  to  all  soldiers.  The  card contains  telephone  numbers  for  the  interactive  voice  response telephone system  and  facsimile  machines,  e-mail  addresses, and  EPMD's address. This gives soldiers a ready reference to the variolls ways in which they can contact their career and assignment managers at  PERSCOM.

## Officer Personnel

The  service  began  FY  1995  with  84,807  active  duty  officcrs  on  the rolls and endcd thc year with 82,539 officers. Of the lattcr number, 70,203 were commissioned officers and  12,336 were  warrant officers. Also,  the U.S.  Mililary Acadcmy  at  Wcst  Point,  New York,  had 4,023 cadets at  the bcginning of the fiscal ycar and ended the year with 3,947. The gradc dis› tributions of commissioned  and  warrant officers arc  provided  in Table  6. The  Army  acccssioncd  5,756  commissioned  officcrs  and  1,023  warrant officers into the active  force duri ng FY  1995. Table 7 provides a summary of  commissioned officer accessions by source and competitive category.

The U.S.  Army Cadet Command is responsible for the Army  Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). Army ROTC consists of two programs: Senior  ROTC  at  colleges  and  universities,  and  Junior  ROTC  at  high schools.  A  total  of 34,470  students  were  enrolled  in  Senior  ROTC;  of these, 11 ,340  were  contracted  cadets  in the  Advanccd  Course.  Cadet Command did not achieve its officer production mission for  FY  1995. Its total objective was 4,500, and it commissioned 3,284 officers. Twenty per› cent of ROTC commissions went to members of  ethnic minorities.

On  I  September  1995,  Cadet  Command  reccived  a  letter  from  the ODCSPER significantly  lowering  the  command's annual  officer produc› tion missions for FYs  1996- 2000. Cadet Command,  however, had a suffi› cient number of  cadets to exceed these new missions. The command began considering a number of  options to meet the reduced missions, including a voluntary  release program for  non-scholarship  cadets,  not  cOlllmissioning graduating cadets who  fell  below an  Order of Merit  List cut-off ranking,

lind  establ ishing a cap on the  number of cadets allowed  to  sign  contracts. Decisions about which options to adopt  will be made in  1 996.

The Scholarship  Allocation  Plan (also known as  "Scholarship Tiering"), developed during  FY  1994,  went  into effect during  FY  1995. The plan provided four tiers of scholarship awards, each of which  had an upper mmual  limit:  Tier  I, $ 12,000, Tier  II, $8,000, Tier  III, $5,000, and Tier  IV,  $2,000. A  cadet  could  not  receive  an  amount  in  excess  of the school's annuai luilion and fees. A specified percentage of  the scholarship budget was allocated to each lier. This plan increased the number ofschol· arships,  but  reduced  the average  val ue of the awards.  Only about  17  per› cent  of  scholarshi ps  were allocated  to Tier I, wh ich resulted  in  the ant ici› pated side effect of lowering ROTC enrollment lit some Ihe nation's most expensive schools.

By  1995, the avcrage staffing level  of Senior ROTC  units  had  fa llen below four officers per unit, the  minimum number considered acceptable for effective  operation of units  and  training of cadets.  During  FY  1995, Cadet Command continued its efforts to align  its organizational structure with reduced resources, fu nding, manpower  levels, and production requirements.  The  command  eliminated  one  brigade  headquarters  and eighteen cxtension cClllers, and rcviewed  its existing units  for closure.  In this  rcview, Cadet Command based its dccisions on enrollment  levels and the  academic degrees of the officers commissioned from  the host  school. In June  1995, the Department oC the Army announccd Ihat ninetccn ROTC units would  be closed over the course  of the  next academic year.  Five of these closings were at the request of the host institution.  Further closings are expected in  FY  1996.

The Junior ROTC program conti nucd to expand, reaching a total  of 178,271  students enrolled at  1,242  high schools during the  1994-1995 school year.  Duri ng the summer of 1995, a total o f 18,82 1 cadets attend› ed Junior ROTC summer camps at  thirty-seven different  locations. The Junior ROTC  summcr camp core curriculum  was  implemcntcd during the  1995  summer encampment.  The  main  elements  of the  curriculum are  Rappelling,  the  Leadership  Reaction  Course,  Land  Navigation, the Confidence and Obstacle Courses, and Aquatic Activity.  Math and sci› ence  instruction  developed  by  the  National  Scicnce  Center  also  was offered at all  camps cxcept those hcld in Germany,  Panama, and  Puerto Rico.  The  Army  collaborates  with the  other  mil itary services, the Department of Education, and  local school districts in the "career acad› emics" program. This  program  integrates Junior  ROTC  with academic and  technical  instruction  to  help  at-risk  youth  acquire  the  skills  they need to compete in a rapidly changing economy.  During the  1994- 1995 school year the Army Junior ROTC began supporting fifteen academies in addition  1 0  the  twenty  acadcmies  it  began  supporting  during  FY 1994. Another expansion of the  program is  planned  for  the  1995- 1996 school year.

The Army Dental Corps has experienced a signi ficant decline in  end strength, well below the budgelCd end strength, over the past several  years. Declining accessions,  low retention  rates  for junior dental  officers,  large educational debts for new denl'al school graduates, the Army's inability to provide  accession  bonuses  and  a  sufficient  number  of scholarships,  a strong  economy,  and  increased  numbers of retirements and  resignations all  contributed  to  this  trend.  The  Dental  Corps shortage was  particula rly acute  in the  area  of general  dentistry  (military  occupational  specialty 63A). As a  result, the Army  Dental System was unable to meet  its opera› lional  requirements and was  forced  to  hire civi lian dentists at iI cost high› er  than if military  dentists  provided  dental  services.  The  Dental  Corps' budgeted end strength  for  FY  1995  was  1,253.  Its actual end strength was 1,158, representing a shortage of ninety-five dentists. The Dental Corps is significantly  under strength,  20  to  53  percent,  in  the  firstto  tenth-year groups. It is over strength in the  1965 to  1982 year groups [these were the years  prior  to  the implementation  of  the  Defense  Officer  Personnel Management Act (DOPMA)], creating .111  imbalance in  the grade profile. One half  of  all dental officers leave the Army following their initial oblig› ation, generally between  three to five years of  service. The most  common reason  for  leaving  the service  is low pay  and  inability to  pay educational loans,  leading to a lower quality of life.

In FY  1995,  DCSPER  activated  the  precursor study  group  that  had been established the previous year in  response to a Force XX I initiative  to redesign  the Army to  employ  more  effectively the  increasingly  powerful digital  technologies.  At  the  time  the  precursor  study  group  was  estab› lished, DCSPER had identified, within the Officer Personnel  Management System (OPMS), the need  for a corresponding review of existing officer personnel  management and  professional development  policics to devclop the  officer  corps  appropriatcJy  to  meet  challenges  it  wou ld  face  in  the twenty-first century.  DCSPER directed the precursor study group to iden› tify  topics,  inCludi ng officer career patterns, rates and  timel iness of  offi› cer promotions,  military and civi lian schooling requirements for officers, joint duty  requirements, modifications of officer evaluation  reports, and command  selection policies and lOll I' lengths. t1mt will need 10 be addressed by an aPMS XX I study group.

In June 1995, Department of the Army Pamphlet 600- 3, Comlllissioned Officer Developmenl and Career Mallagemelll, was  pub› lished.  This  pamphlet  consol idated  into  one  source  recent  initiatives  in leader development and changes to the OPMS made since  1986.

Implementation  DOPMA  continued  throughout  FY  1995. The Army remained in  compliance wilh  DOPMA standards for promotion selection opportunity and  promotion  timing,  except  for  promotion  timing  for  the grade of major, which exceeded the standard ten years (plus or minus one

year)  by  an  average  of seven  mont hs.  A  summary  of officer promotion rates with respect to DOPMA standards  for basic branch selection is  pro› vided  in Table 8.

The  service's officer drawdown  program  in  FY  1995  continued  to emphasize  voluntary  separation  programs  and  minimized  involuntary scpamlion programs. Under these programs, a total of  2,478 officers left the  active  Army  in  FY  1995.  The  Volu ntary  Early  Release/Retirement Program (VERRP) included colonels and  lieutenant colollels with lime› in-grade  waivers,  lieutenants separating with  two  years, active duty  for assignment  to  reserve  component  units,  and  warrant  officers  in  over› manned military occupational  specialtics. VS IP targeted captains in  the reduction-in-force zone, captains who were passed over for promotion to major one time, and chief warrant officers W- 2 and W- 3 in ovcrmanned skills and ineligible for VERRP.  Majors who were passed over twice for promotion,  warrant officers  in  overmanned  mi litary occupational spe› cialt ies, majors who were not yet being considered for promotion to lieu› tenant colonel, and  captains and  warrant officers who were passed ovcr once  for  promotion  were  tilrgeted  by  ERP.  Sclective  Early  Retirement Boards  selected  a  fixed  number  of retirement-cligible  officers,  not  to exceed 30 percent of  the eligible population, for involuntary early retire› ment. A reduetion-in-force scheduled for February  1995 to consider cap› tains  in  the  1986  year group  was canceled  because  of sufficient  VSl P volunteers. Table 9 summarizes active Army officer losses from  separa› tion  programs.

As a  result  of a  January  1986  Freedom of Information  Act  (FOIA) out-or-Couft settlement, PERSCOM was required to create and provide to realtors a  weekly  listing of releasable  officer assignments.  Realtors  used the  li sti ng  to sol icit  officers to  buy or sell  thei r homes  upon a  permanent change of station. By  1994, the  number of FOIA  requests  for  the  listing had  grown to  about  seventy  a  week, creating tl large administrative  bur› den.  In  June  1995,  an  interagency  agreement  was  signed  between  PER› SCOM,  the Personnel Information Systems Command,  and the Department  of  Commerce's  National  Technical Information Service (NTIS) under which  the  Personnel  Information  Systems  Command  pro› vides the Army officer and enlisted reassignment lists directly to  NTIS for dissemination. Additionally,  information  provided  to  the  public  by  NT IS is  no  longer subject  to  the  FOIA.  The  NT IS,  a  fee-lor-service  organi za› tion,  is  authorized  by  statute  to  collect  governmen t  expenditures  when providing  information to  the public.  Most of PERSeOM's administrative and  manpower costs arc  recouped  from  the  public  by  NTIS.  The  annual saving  to  thc  Army  is  estimated  at  $50,000  per year  for  each  year  the agreement is in effect. The  agreement  is  scheduled for renewal in September 1996.

## Civilioll  Persollnel

The  Army's civil ian  work  forcc  numbered  323,619,  11 rcduction  of about 17,000 from the FY  1994 final end strength. The civilian work  force includes all  U.s.  and  foreign  national  civilian  employees  of the Army  in both  military  and  civil  functions.  The  number of cmployees  paid  from appropriated funds  fell  during  FY  1995  from  306,480 to 296,236. Within thi s category,  the  number of civilians  in  military  functions also  declined, going  from  279,526 at  the beginning of thc  fiscal  year to 266,549 at the end of the year.

Most of the civilian  reductions in  FY  1995 were achievcd through nor› mal attrition coupled with hiring controls and through usc ofvolulliary early retirement  authority and civilian  pay incentives.  Vol untary early  retirements increased 3 1 pereent,  from 2,259  in  FY  1994 to  2,960  in  FY  1995.  Use of voluntary separation  incentive pay increased 62 pereent,  from 4,36 1 recipi› ents in FY  199410 7,085 in  FY  1995. The number of  reduction  -in-force sep› arations decreased slightly,  from  899 in  FY  1994 to 859 in  FY  1995.  Most of the  reduction-i n-force  sepanltions  in FY 1995  resulted  from BRAe actions  at  C,U11eron  Station,  Virginia;  Lexi ngton  Bluegrass  Army  Depot, Kentucky; and Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Under DOD Priority Placement Program, 2, 184 excess or displaced employees were placed in new positions in  FY  1995. This  figure  remained  essentially unchanged  from  the number of  placements in  FYs  1993 and  1994.

Although attrition, hiring controls, and incentives arc effective tools in reducing  numbers  and  lessening  adverse  impacts  on  younger  workers, they also create imbalances in the Army's civilian work force. The average age orthe work  force increased from  43.2 years in FY  19891045.3 years in FV 1995. The  average  while-collar  grade  increased  from  8.27  in September  1989 10  9.07 in September 1995. As another indication of Ihis upward trend,  the  average pay step rose from  4.46 in  September  1989 to 5.62  in  September 1995.

## Special Topics

At  the  end ofFY  1995,  women composed  13.4  percent or the  active Army:  14.5  percent  were commissioned officers,S  percent warrant ofTi› cers, 13.5 percent  enlisted  personnel,  and  12.3  percent  cadets.  In  the reserve components,  women made  up 22.4 percent of the  USAR and 8.2 percent of the ARNG.

In  FY 1995,  the  Army's position  on  the  assignment of womcn  was consistent with  DOD policy.  Women may deploy with any  unit  or in  any position open to  the assignment of women in accordance with the assign· men!  policy.  On I  October  1994,  as  a  result  of an  assignment  policy change announced by the Secretary o f Defense in  January  1994, a total of 32,699 additional  positions were opened to women. The end of the fiscal year found Slightly fewer than  1,000 women assigned to these positions in active,  reserve,  and  guard  organizations.  Women  were  authorized  in  87 percent of enlisted specialties, 97  percent of warrant officer specialties, and 97  percent of commissioned officer specialties. The  following Army units,  positions, and  military occupational  specialties  were  opened on  I Octobcr to  the  assignment  of women: divisional  military  police  compa› nies;  chemical  reconnaissance  and  smoke  platoons;  mechanized  smoke platoons; engineer bridge companies;  military intelligence collection and jamming companies;  forward  support  teams  of  forward  support  balta I· ions; 3d Infantry (Old  Guard) Regiment  military police company; air cav› alry troops of armored cavalry regiments;  air cavalry troops of divisional cavalry squadrons; maneuver and separate  brigade headquarters; combat engineer battalion  headquarters; the headquartcrs of thc  3d Infantry (Old Guard)  Regiment;  armored  cavalry  regimental  headquarters;  the  head· quarters of the  160th Aviation  Regiment (Airborne); special forces group headquarters;  air  defense  arti llery  battalion  headquarters;  and  military occupational  specialties  12C Engineer Bridge Crewmember, 12Z Combat Engineer Senior Sergeant, and 82C Field Artillery Surveyor.  Infantry and armor specialties and special  operations forces aircran remained closed to women, but all  conventional aviation positions were open to female avia› tors.  At the close of FY  1995, the Army had  19  women  traincd  to  fly  the

AH-64 Apache,  [4  tnlincd  to fly the  01-l- 58D  Kiowa  Warrior,  and  5 trained to fly the AI-II  Cobra.

The FY  1995  National  Defense Authorization Act included two issues that affected women in Ihe Army.  First, the aCI  required the Army to report annually to Congress on  trends  in  recruiting,  retention, personnel  readi› ness, discrimination, and disciplinary  proceedings. This  information  will be  presented by gender, rank, and ethnic origin. Second, the act continued the  Defense  Women's Health  Research  Program.  This  prognlln,  which began  in  1994, coordinates Illultidiscipline and multi-institution  research on women's health issues related to service in  the armed forces. The Army is  the executive agent for the program.

TRADOC and the Soldier Support  Institute continued  in  FY  1995  to develop and revise equal opportunity and prevention of  sexual harassment tra ining support  packages  for incorporation  into  Programs of Instruction for Army schools. A videotape on preventing sexual  harassment is in  pro› duction  for  use  by  units  and  insti tutions  in  thei r  traini ng  programs.  The videotape is designed to faci litate interactive, discussion-based trai ni ng in small,  mixed-gender groups.  In Novembcr  1994, Army Training Circular 26-6,  Commander s Equal  Opporllfllily/Sexllal  Hal'{lssmellf  Halldbook, was distributed to the field.

From  March  1994  to  May  1995,  DOD  Equal  Opportunity  Council Task  Force met to examine the sexual harassment policies and procedures of DOD and the military services.  In May  1995, the task  force relcased its report that  identified  principles and goals  for  military equal opportunity programs. To  improve  these  programs,  the  report  also offered  forty-eight recommendations  for  the  military  services  to  consider.  The  Army  wi ll address  the  recommendations  in  the  next  revision  of Army  Regulation 600-20, Army Command Policy.

The  number of sexual  harassment  complaints  reported  in  FY 1995 continued a downward trend.  During the  fiscal  year, a total of  424 sexual harassmcnt complaints werc processed through IG and Equal Opportunity Advisory channels;  165 were validated.  In comparison, 649 sexual harass› ment  complaints  were  processed  through  IG  and Equal  Opportunity Advisory  channels  in  FY  1993.  Of that  number,  262  were  found  to  be valid.  Of the  5 12  sex ual  harassment  complai nts  processed  in  FY 1994, 146 were validated.

The  number of racial  and  ethnic discrimination complaints  processed through the  IG  and  Equal Opportunity Advisory channels also continued a downward trend in FY  1995. There were 429 racial and ethnic discrimina› tion complaints processed  in FY  1995, and 77 were validated.  In compari› son, 943  racial and ethnic discrimination complaints were processed in FY 1993, and  18 1 were found to be valid.  In FY  1994,  18 1 racial and ethnic dis› crimination complaints were validated out of  the 69 1 complai nts processed.

In FY  1995, a total  of9,9 18 soldiers  received substance abuse rehabil› it ation through the Army's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program (ADA PCP). While this number was down from the  11 ,500 soldiers treated  in  FY  1994, much  of the  decrease  is  attributable  to  the  continued decline in the Army' s force structure. Formal educational treatment services were  provided  to  4,088  soldiers, and  3 10,677 soldiers received  prevention education classes  under ADAPCP during  FY  1995. Throughout the  fiscal year, the Army continued to usc testing as a deterrent to drug usc. A total of 1,097, 103  active ;:lIld  reserve component soldiers  were  tested  in  FY  1995, and the positive rale for the Army remains allcss than  I percent (0.98  per› cent).  Dependent  children  of  soldiers  stationed  in  Europe  and  the  Pacific received  substancc  abusc  counseling  through  the  U.S.  Army  Drug  and Alcohol  Operations Agency's (USADAOA)  Adolescent  Substance Abuse Counseling Service. In FY  1995, a total of 1,2 18 youths were counseled and 50,443 youths attended one of the  1,751  substance abuse prevention class› es taught by the counseling service.

In  November  1994, the  USADAOA  conducted  a workshop  for  installa› tion  Alcohol and  Drug Control  OO"icers. The  result  of the  workshop  was a decision to implement Army-wide the Risk Reduction Proccss that was devel› oped  and  initiated  at  F ort  Campbell,  Kentucky,  in  January  1994.  TIle  Risk Reduction  Process assists  units  and  installation  staff in  identifying and ana› lyzing  soldiers' high-risk  behaviors,  and  in  providing  prevention  and  inter› vention actions to reduce them. These behaviors were identified as dlllg and alcohol abusc, driving while under the influence of dmgs or alcohol, spouse and ehild abuse, crimes against persons and  property, injuries and accidents, suicides, sexually transmitted diseases, and fi nancial problems. Between April and  September  1995, the  Risk  Reduction  Process  was  implemented  at  F ort Bliss, Texas;  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina;  Fort  Carson,  Colorado;  and  Fort Drum, New York. At FOlt Campbell, the Risk Reduction Process continued to show significant decreases in  incidents of  high-risk behavior.

On  6  Junc 1995,  a  ceremony  was  held  at  Fort  Lesley  J. McNair, Washington.  D.C.,  whcre  the  skeletal remains  of twenty-five  Pawnec Indians, of which six  were  veteran Army  scouts, were turned over by  the Smithsonian  Institution  to  the Army  for repatriation  to  the  Pawnee  Indian Nation  in  Genoa,  Nebraska.  The Army  veteran  Pawnees  were  killed  by American  settlers  around 1860,  and their  remai ns were  sent  to the Smithsonian  Institution' s  National  Museulll  for  anthropological study.  In January  1995. the  Pawnees rcquested,  under the  provisions of the  Indian Repatriation Act, the return of  the remains of  all  Pawnee Indians for prop› er burial. The interment  service for the six Army scouts was conducted on 7 June  1995 at Genoa. Soldiers from Fort  Riley, Kansas, provided the vol› ley salute and flag presentation. The six  interment nags were presented to representatives of the Pawnee Nation.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Blueprint for the Fwure

Force  XX I is the Army's comprehensive  approach to  transforming the current  twentieth-century  industrial-age  Army  into  a  t",·enly-fi rst century information-age Anny. Instituted during FY  1994, the Force XXI campaign requires  the  AmlY \0  integrate  emerging  information  technologies  with sound doctrine, reinvented organizations, and high-quality people to make a smaller force more lelhal, more durable, and more powerful. In addition, the Force XXI Army will be modular, allowing the service to generate, project, and sustain force packages that meet the specific needs of  a joint force com› mander. It will be ideally  suited  for joint operations and  rely on advanced technologies that promise to revolutionize the conduct orwar in areas of  sit› uat ional  awareness, lethality and dispersion,  volume and  precision  of fi re, integrat ive  technology,  mass  and  effects,  and  detectability.  In  the  Army's vision, command and  control  on a  future  battlefield will  be  based  on  real time,  shared  situational  awareness.  Echelons  will  be  more  specialized  as more people gain access to  information, and  units will  rely  more on elec› tronic rather than geographic or physical connectivity.

The Force XX I campaign has  three axes. The  first  is the  redesign  of the Army's  operational forces, an effort designated JOINT VENTURE because it  requires  the  participation  of  all  MACOMs and  the Army Staff to be successful. TRADOC is responsible for overseeing and coordinating JOINT  VENTURE.  The second axis  is an effort to  rcdesign  the  institutional Army,  that  part  of thc  service  that  gcneratcs  and  sllstains  thc  operating forces.  Like JOINT  VENTURE,  this elTort  includes major commands and the Army Staff. The Vice Chief of Staff, Army, supervises this axis lIsing  the DCSOPS as the executive agent. The third axis concentrates on the devel› opment and acquisition of digital information  technology to  field "digi› tized"  units. This axis  is  led  by the Army  Digitization Office, which  was established  in  FY  1994. Also in  FY  1994, the Chicf  of Staff,  Army, gave the  Louisiana  Maneuvers Task  Forcc-creatcd  in  FY  1992  to  provide a framework  for  managing changes in  the  post- Cold  War Armythe  mis› sion of synchronizing and  integrating thc three  Force XX I axes.

During FY  1995.  work on  Force XXI began to  move beyond the con› ceptual  phase, and it  became necessary to differentiate between the exper› imentation  process and  the  product.  The  term  Force  XXI begun  to  mean difTcrenl lhings to different people, and  it  was determined that a clarifica› tion  oflcnns was  needed. Thus,  Force XX I was defined as the  process of bui ld ing an army for the twen ty-fi rst  century. and Army  XXI  as the result of that  process.  Army  XXI is  to  be a  knowledge- and capabilities-based, power-projection service for the twenty-first century.

The Chief of StafT, Army.  became concerned  during FY  1995  about the  afTordabilily  of Force  XX I  and  directed  DCSOPS,  in  coordination with TRADOC, to layout a realistic campaign plan based on the best esti· mate of  Army resources. Force XX I funding issues were a key topic at the 11 July  1995  Senior Commanders' Conference.  Discussions  among  the Army's senior leaders led  to  three  major decisions.  First, the Army  must n1&lt;lintain  an  investment strategy  in  its  moderni zation  program  to  ensure that only those systems that  will  provide the biggest battlefield  payoff are upgraded fi rst.  Second,  funding  for  all  future "good  ideas" for  Force  XX I must  already  be identifi ed.  Third, advanced  warfighting  experiments (AWE) for combat service support and reserve components would be can· celed and related initiatives in these areas incorporated into the Task Force XXI brigade·level AWEs and  the  Division  XX I AWEs.

The AWEs are the  means  by  which the JOINT  VENTURI;  axis of Force XXI tcsts technologies,  organizations, and techniques designed to incrcase unit warrighting capabilities by using digital technologies. These experiments  look at doctrine,  training,  leader development, organization, design,  materiel, and  soldier  systcms  requirements.  The  results  of these experimenls provide  the  basis  for decisions by senior Army leaders con· cerning these areas. TRADOC plans to conduct a series of AWEs  leading up 1 0 the Task Force  XXI  AWE in  1997. The  first AWE, DI~ERT HAMMER VI, was completed in  FY  1994.

TRADOC conducted several  AWEs in  FY  1995.  FOCUSED  DISPATCII, which eoncludcd  in  August  1995, was a  heavy battal ion  task  force AWE conducted al  Fort  Knox,  Kentucky.  One  company of the  task  force con~ ducted live exercises while three companies conducted exercises using the Simulation  Network.  The  primm'Y purpose of FOCUSED DISPATCII  was  to examine the impact of digital  connectivity on a ballalion  task  force. The AWE  experimented  with procedural, functional, and orgil ni zaliona l changes  in  rire  support,  intelligence,  logistics,  and  battle  command  to determine  whether these changes result  in  greater lethality,  survivabi lity, and  operational  tempo.  FOCUSED  DISI'ATCII  confirmed  that  future  com· manders would have an unprecedented view of the battlefield. This AWE also generated sevend  other significant insights. It showed thaI  even the most able battalion commanders can be overwhelmed with digitized infor·

mation, and that  the brigade headquarters tntlst  filter combat information to answer  battalion commanders'  specific information requirements. Another observation  was  that  commanders  used  digital systems  to  plan and coordinate,  but sti ll  rclied on voice communications to  execute oper› ations. Further,  FocUSED  DISI'ATCH  showed  thai  digilizalion  provides  a great benefit to combat service support operations. For  example, enhanced situational awareness allowed logistics personnel to  meet emer› gency resupply  requirements by rerouting supply vehicles already on  the move  and  to  initiate  proactively  resupply  of units  consolidating  on  the objective aficr an attack.

PRAIRIE WARRIOR,  the capstone exercise for students at the U.S.  Army Command and General  Staff College  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas,  is  a means for the Army to experiment with joint- and corps-level issues. The AWE  part  of  PRAIRIE  WARRIOR  95,  held  in  May  1995,  was  the  Mobile Strike  Force,  a  division-size  force  equipped  with  the  technologies  and operational concepts envisioned for 20 I  O. This AWE examined staff orga› nizations  and  division-level  operational  concepts,  and  used  a  variety  of simulations to look  at  the echelons  from  battalion  to  theater.  A  key con› cept  experimented  within  this AWE  was  the simultaneolls application of precision  fires  across  the  enlire  enemy  force,  followed  immediately  by mancuver exploitation 10  defcat  rapidly  the enemy.  A  significant  insight was  that  all  brigade-level  organizalions---combat,  combat  support,  and combat service supportbecame combined arlllS teams in  every sense of the term,  executing combat, combat  support, and  combat service support operations simultaneously and continuously.

The  WARRIOR  Focus AWE  began  in  May  1995  with  elements  of the 10th  Mountain  Division  (Light). This AWE will  examine cnhancemcnts to thc lcthality, survivabi lity, and tcmpo ofa reinforced light infantry task force as a  result  of new  battlefield digital  communication and night vision  tech› nologies  designed  to  incrcase  interconnectivity  and  situational  awareness across echelons and clements of tile task  force. The  WARRIOR  Focus AWE will  conclude  in November  1995  with  elemcnts  of the  10th  Mountain Division, rei nforced with special  forces and heavy forces, participl.lting in II rotation at  the Joi nt Rcad iness Traini ng Centcr, Fort  Polk, Louisiana.

During FY  1995, work continued on "Own-the-Night"  technologics. (Own-the-Night  technology  consists  of many systems.  Third generation night vision tubes allow soldiers to see better at  night.  Infrared laser point› crs allow soldiers and  leaders to designate and illuminate targets and sec› tors of fire. A  variety of beacons, ligh ts, and chemical lights provide sol› diers  with  lightweight  and  durable  infrared  light sources.  There are  also several munitions thai provide infrared illumination over a wider area Ihan their  "white light" counterparts.) In addition to cxpcriments  during WARRIOR  Focus and other AWEs, thc Infantry Center and Ihe Dismounted

Battlespace Battle Laboratory at Fort Benning, Georgia, opened the Night Fighting Training  Facility.  This  facility  uses  a variety  of methodologies, including a heavy rel iance on simulations, to  train  trainers and  individual soldiers in various skills necessary for fighting and operating at night.

On  15  March  1995,  the  Chief of Staff,  Army,  designated  the  2d Armored  Division,  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  as  the  Army's experimental  force (EX FOR). and  placed it  under the operational control ofTRAOOC with the mission of  conducting advanced  warfighting  experiments.  The EXfOR will  be the Army's primary means to experiment  with  new infor~ mati on technologies and concepts and,  Ihus,  wi ll include all categories of operational  forces so that  its experiments, organizcd around the exploita› ti on of  information technologies, wi ll provide insights that will benefit the entire  Army. Initial EXFOR  efforts  will  concentrate  on  reorganizing, reequipping, and training one brigade combat  team of the division, along with  a li ght infantry  battal ion  drawn from  another  division,  for the Brigade Task Force XXI AWE scheduled for 1997 at the National  Training Ccnter (NTC).  Following  this  AWE,  the Army's senior leaders will  make decisions on the redesign of brigades and divisions.

The Army has a  tradition  of using  EXFORs to  obtain (I better under› sl&lt;lnding  of issues and  to  develop solutions under realistic conditions with fi eld soldiers and units.  Past  EXFORs have suffered  from a shortage of  the kinds of  equipment  planned for the future  force with which  they could con› duct the experiment. Therefore, the Department of  the Anny plans to accel› erate  the  fielding  to  the  2d  Armored  Division  new  systems,  such  as  the M I09A6  Paladin  self-propelled  howitzer,  and  prototype systems,  such  as the  hardware  and  software  required  to  provide  common  computer  links throughout a combat brigade. This accelerated fielding is  necessary for the EXFOR to be able to conduct the Brigade Task  Force XXI AWE in  1997.

An important  part  of  the  JOINT VENTURE  axis  is  the Battlefield Laboratories (Battlc  Labs)  Program, which  was  created  in  May  1992  by the TRADOC commander and consists of  six battle labs:  Battle Command at  Fort  Leavenworth, Kansas;  Depth and Simultaneous Attack at Fort Si ll, Oklahoma; Mounted  Battle Space  at  Fort  Knox,  Kentucky;  Dismounted Battle  Space at  Fori  Benning,  Georgia; Combat Service Support  at  Fort Lee, Virginia; and  Early  Entry Lethality and Survivability at  Fort Monroe, Virginia.  One of the most successful  initiatives of the program during FY 1995  was STRONG SAFETY. In December  1994, thc  Chief of StafT, Army, di rected  the Battle  Labs  Program  to  conduct  experiments  focused  on improving force protection  from  rocket attacks. The experiments brought together representatives from industry, selected battle  labs, program man› agers, and  research scientists from  agencies throughout  DOD. The exper› iments  involvcd  using  currently  fie lded  equipment  to  detect,  track,  and engage incoming rockets. Various sensor and  shooter combinations were

employed, some of  which were significalli departures from current tactics, techniques,  and  procedures.  The  results  far  exceeded  expectations. In fewer than ninety days, successful  mid-flighl intercepts demonstrated new operational capabilities that call be employed today.

## Force Development

Because of post- Cold War changes in  U.S.  national security strategy, the  bulk of the Army  now  is based  in  CONUS, with a  much-diminished fOlward presence. The service is now focused on projecting tailored force packages  overseas  in response  to  crises. Crisis-response  contingency forces  will  come  primari ly  from  the  act ive  forces,  whereas  the service's sustainment capabilities will come primarily from the reserve component. The Army' s  force structure  will  stabi li ze in  1996 with  a four~corps, eigh~ teen-division  organization  comprising  both  active  and  reserve eompo~ nents. The major combat units of  the active component will consist offour divisions stationcd overseas (two in  Europe  and  two  in  the  Pacific),  four U.S.-based contingeney~force divisions prepared to deploy as  part of cri~ sis  response forces, and two active U.S.~based rapid~response reinforcing divisions.  The  major combat  units of the  reserve component  will  consist of fifteen  ARGN  nondivisional  enhanced  readiness  brigades  and  eight ARNG divisions.  ARNG enhanced readiness brigades wi ll provide  rein› forcing  forces duri ng  a  crisis  whi le  the  ARNG  divisions  wi ll  serve  as  a strntegie reserve during a protracted conflict.

The prol iferation of weapons of mass destruction, along with cruise and tactical ballistic missi le technologies, poses increased threats to Army forces.  In response, the service continued to place significant emphasis on missi le defense. The The&lt;l~er High Altitude Area Defense system is intend› ed to provide coverage to defeat missiles at extended ranges and high alti› tudes. On 21  April  1995, the first  ni ght test of  the missi le was conducted. The test  achieved  its Objective  of gat hering  information  on  the  in-fl ight performance of  the missile.

Also during  FY  1995, the Army continued to  modernize in  an  effort to  improve  its  abi lity  to  conduct  deep-attack  precision  strike  operations against  any  threat. The  first  prototype of the  RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter was delivered  to  the Army, and  flight  tests  are scheduled  to  begin  in  early  FY 1996.  In  September  1995,  the  Defense Acquisition Board approved the Crusader  Advanced Field Artillery System  to  proceed  into  the  demonstration  and  evaluation  phase.  The Advanced  Field  Artillery  Tactical  Data  System,  which  will  provide  an automated  command,  control,  and  communications  systcm  for  fire  sup› port  systems as part of the Army  Battle Command System, successfully completed its  Initial  Operational Test and Evaluation.

Sevenll active Army units and organiZ&lt;llions were inactivdlcd, rcflaggcd, or realigned in FY  1995 as the Army continued its post- Cold War reduction. In  October  1994,  the  U.S.  Army  Medical  Command (Provisional) became the U.S. Anny Medical Command (MEDCOM), commanded by the Army's Surgeon  General. MEDCOM  replaced  the  U.S.  Army  Health  Services Command, which was inactivated. This change completed a rcorganiz.1tion of  Army medicine begun in October 1993 with the establishment of  the u.s. Army Medical Command (Provisional). The key feature orlhis reorganiza› tion  was  to  merge several  medical  clements  into a  new organization under the command of  the Surgeon Gcncwl, who remains a member of  the Army Staff. This reorganization streamlines and flattens the command and control structure of Army medicine; links missions to organizational structure; and el iminates  fu nctional  overlaps,  inefficiencies, unnecessary  duplicat ion, and operational voids. The following organizations are under the command and control of MEDCOM:  U.S.  Army  Medical  Department  and  School,  U.S. Army  Dcntal Command,  and  U.S.  Army Veterinary Command,  all at  ForI Sam Houston, Texas; U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Activity, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland; all Army health service support arcas; all Army medicill  centers  and  Army  Medical  Department  activities;  and  medical installations  at  Waltcr  Reed  Army  Medical  Center,  District  of Columbia; Fitzsimmons  Army  Medical  Center,  Colorado;  and  U.S.  Army  Garrison, Fort  Detrick, Maryland.

Two  other  MACOMs  inactivated  in  FY 1995  were  the  Sixt h  US. Army,  inactivated at the Presidio of San  Francisco, California, on  23  June 1995, and the Second US. Army,  inactivatcd at  Fort  Gillem, Georgia, on 3 July  1995. The area of responsibil ity of Fiflh  US. Army, located at  Fort Sam  Houston,  was  expanded  to  include  the  area  covered  previously  by Sixth  US.  Army.  First  U.S.  Army  moved,  without  personnel  and equip› ment, from  Fort  Meade,  Maryland, to  ForI  Gillem.  First  U.S. Army's area of responsibility WtlS expanded  to  include the area  previollsly  covered  by Second U.S.  Army.

The  177th  Armored  Brigade,  which  provided  the  Opposing  Forces used althe National Training Center, was reflagged in October 1994 as the 11 th  Armorcd Cavalry  Regiment (ACR);  the  11  th  ACR  will  continue  to provide  the  Opposing  Forces  at  the  NTC.  The  193d  Infantry  Brigade, Panama Canal  Zone, was  inactivated in  October  1994.  In April 1995,  the 3d  Brigade,  I  Sl Armored Division, Fort Lewis, Washington, was rcflagged as the 3d Brigade, 2d Infantry Division. The 194th Armored Brigade, Fort Knox, Kentllcky, was inactivated in June  1995. In August 1995, the flag of the  lSI  Brigade,  25th  Infantry  Division, Schofield  Barracks,  Hawaii,  was moved to Fort  Lewis, Washington, where the  I  st Brigade (also referred to as  the  9th Infant ry). 7th Infantry  Division,  was  reflagged  as  the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division.

## Trail/ ing

CTCs arc  the centerpiece  of the  Army's training  system.  The  CTCs lISC highly skilled Opposing Forces and observers and controllers, togcth· cr with  live-fire exercises  and  unrest ricted  force-on-force  maneuvers, to simulate  combat.  The  Army's goal  is  to  have  all commanders  of active component combat maneuver and special operations force battalions train at a eTC at least once du ri ng their command tours. There arc three maneu› ver CTCs: the NTC at Fort  Irwin, California; the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana; and the Combat ManeuvcrTrain ing Center at  Hohcnfe ls,  Germany.  The objective of the eTC program  is  to  provide realist ic, tough, and stressful joint, inlerservice, and combined arms t rain~ ing according to Army and joint doctrine.  In FY  1995, a total of seventy~ seven  maneuver  battalions  trained  at either  Fort  Irwin,  Fort  Polk,  or  at Hohenfcls. The Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) extends CTC train ing  to division and  corps commanders and their staffs. The two~part BCTP experience consists of a seminar followed several months  later by a computer battle~simulat ioll command post exercise.  Both phases can be conducted  at  the  unit's home  station,  permitting  more  realistic  traini ng, with wider involvement of staffs  in  a  tactical  field  cnviron mcnt at  lower cost.  The  BCTP objective  is  to  tra in  all  active  com ponent  divis ion  and corps staffs once every two years (12- 15 rotations per year) and all ARNG division staffs once every three years.

In  FY 1995,  the  Partnership  for  Peace  (PFP)  Exercise  Program  was established as one of the  North Atlantic Treaty OrganiZ&lt;1tion's (NATO)  top priority  political  and  mili tary  initiatives.  The  PFP  Exercise  Progmm  is designed to expand and improve military and political cooperation between NATO  and  other  European  nations  that  belong  to  NATO's PFP program. These exercises,  which focus on  noncombat operations,  cnhancc  the coor~ dinalion of military  forces for peacekeeping, humanitarian  assistance, and search  and  rescue operations.  In FY  1995,  the  foclls was on company~and battalion~level part ic ipat ion. In August  1995, a PFP exercise, COOPERATIVE NUGGET 95, was conducted at the Joint Readiness Training Center. The aim of  this exercise was to foster interoperability among the p..1rticipating forces using combined peacekeeping and  humanitarian  relief tactics,  tcchniques, and communications procedures at  the platoon and company levels.  About 978  soldiers from three NATO  and  twelve  other  cenlml and  eastern European countries participated  in the exercise alongside  their  U.S. coun~ terparts.  Each  PFP  partner country contributed  a  rine  ptatoon. These pla~ toons were combined into rine companies that formed the NATOIPFP bat~ talion. The combined  NATOfPFP battalion, together with U.S. combat sup~ port and combat service sllPl&gt;0rt  units, reported to a U.S.  brigade headqllar~ ters.  Twelve  coalition  support  teams  from  the  10th Special  Forces  Group

44

(Airborne) supported the peacekeeping forces. These support teams provid› ed  technical  and  linguistic  support  to  the  partner  nation  contingents. The training was conducted in  accordance with current  U.S.  Army,  NATO,  and United Nations training methodologies.

The Chief of Staff, Army. eliminated  the Self  Development Test  for soldiers  on  2  Pebruary  1995.  The  test  was  designed  in 1992  to  be  the replacement  for  the  Skill  Qualification Test.  However, the downsizing of the Army made it  very difficult to keep  the  tests current. The inabi lity  to keep  the  tests  updated,  the  lack  of tests  for  some  military  occupational specialties,  the  focus  on  unit  training  requi red by the  mission-essential task li st, and the improvements  in the Noncommissioned  Officer Education  System  (NCOES)  all  contributed  to  the  demise  of the  Self Development Test.

The Secretary of thc Army, in  March  1995, approved the requirement that  soldiers  scheduled  to  attend  certain  NCOES  and  functional courses must pass the Army Physical Fitness Test prior to enrollment. This require~ ment  was one of the recommendations developed by the Sergeant Major of the Army's NCOES  process action  leam. Toward  the end of the  fiscal year,  this  policy  was  under  review  because of the  negative  effect  it  was having on reserve component soldiers and their units when many ofthcse soldiers failed  their qualifying Physical Fitness Test.

During FY  1995, ODCSOPS and PERSCOM worked on a new distri~ bution  plan  for  the  assignment  of  officers who  graduate  each  year  from the  School  of Advanced  Military  Studies.  This  effort  was  the  result  of requests  from  units  that  thcy  be  assigned  add itiona l  advanced  military studies  graduates.  The  Chicf of Slaff,  Army,  will  make  a  decision  on whether to "pprove the new distribution scheme in  FY  1996.

Increased  environmental  regulation  and  increasing  economic dcvel~ opmenl  around  Army  installations  arc  growing  challenges  to  effective training.  In  October  1994,  the  Training  Directorate,  ODCSOPS,  which had  recently  assumed  responsibility  for  the Integrated  Training  Area Managcment (!TAM) program, began detailed planning and coordination with  MACOM  hcadquarters to delineatc the scope of the  [TAM  program under ODCSOPS. This program manages land used for training on Army installations  and  seeks  to  balance  the  demands  of high~quality training with  envi ronmental  stewardship.  In  Octobcr  1994, and again  in  January 1995,  planning  sessions  were  held  with  the  training  and  environmental staffs of  major  Army  commands.  The  first formal !TAM  Program Management Review was held in June 1995, focusing on the FY  1996 and 1997  budgets.  In  August  1995,  ODCSOPS  representatives  attended  the Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance  conference  at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and began 10  take action to  redirect this important ill sta llati oll~ level forum  to address the  full  scope of the !TAM  program.

In  September 1995, the Army Training Support Center completed the prototype of the  new  Standard Army Training System  version 4.0 com› puter software  program. This automated  training  management  computer program  was  developed  to  support  training  management  and  funding within  the Army in  accordance with training management doctrine found in Field  Manuals  25- 100, Trail/ing  the  Force; 25- 101 , Balfle  Focused Trainillg; and  100- 5, Operations.

In  December  1994,  the  Chief of Staff,  Army,  tasked  DCSOPS  to explore ways to revitalize the Army's training development capability. The Directorate of  Training, ODCSOPS, in  turn, directed thai a careful  assess› ment  be  made  of training  development  requirements  created  by  Force XXI,  distance  learning,  new  equipment  trai ning,  and  all  other  material, programs, and systcms that support Army training. Training Developmcnt Task  Force  2 1,  which  consists  of representatives  from TRADOC;  NGB; USAR:  and  the  Training  Directorate,  ODCSOPS,  submitted  its  final report  on  8 June  1995. The task force  concluded that  the service  needed to articulate a training strategy, publish policy that supported that strategy. and allocate the resources required to support the strategy.

Because of  the effect that base realignments and closures had on various U.S. Air Force installations,  the Anny needed to  identify a pernmnent aerial port  for  units  deploying  for  training  at  NTC  at  Fort  Irwin,  near  Barstow, California.  In  1990, the  Army  initiated  an  Analysis  of Alternatives  Study (AAS). to  investigate  several proposed  alternative  locations. The AAS  did not  include Edwards Air Force Base, California,  because the base comman~ der at that time did not feel  that  his mission and the NTC aerial port mission were compatible. In  November 1994, after reviewing all  feasible alternatives for a permanent NTC aerial  port, the AAS selected the Barstow-Daggett air› field as the preferred option. In December 1994, the Chicf  of  Staff, Air Force, stated  that  Edwards Ai r Force  Base was available  for consideration,  and  the Army initiated a second AAS  in  January  1995.  In August  1 995, the second AAS  recommended  Edwards  Air  Force  Base as  the  preferred option. The Secretary  of  the  Army  approved  the  second  AAS  in Scptember  1995. However,  in  formulating  thc  FY  1996  budget,  Congress  appropriated  an additional  $ 1 0  Illi llion  for  Phase  II  construction  at  Barstow-Daggctt  in  thc FY  1996 Military Constnlction Act. Section 124 of  the Military Construction Act  required  thc Army to  lise  fonncr George Air Force  Base, California, as an interim aerial port until  Barstow-Dagget reached initial operational capa› bility.  The  conference  report  on  the  FY 1996  Defense  Authorization  Act aUlhorized  an  additional  $10  million  for  Phase  II  construction  conti ngenl lIpon DOD certificalion Ihal  Barstow-Daggett best mel the operational train› ing needs of  the NTC. The FY  1996 Defense Appropriations Act also delet› ed funding for tmining rotations using Edwards Air Force Base and required the Army to cease operations at  Edwards aftcr 15 April  1996.

## Deployed Opem/iol1al Forces

During FY 1995, the Army  had  an  average  of  22,200  soldiers deployed operationally to  morc  than  seventy countries on  any given day. Highlights of these deployments included helping to promote democracy in  Haiti, deterring threats 10  regional  stability  in  Southwest  Asia  and  the Balkans,  maintaining  the  peace  in  the  Sinai,  assisting  refugees  in  the Caribbean, and treating the wounded in Croatia.

On  15  September 1994, units fi'om the XVII I Airborne Corps, the  10th Mountain Division (Light), and the 82&lt;.1  Airborne Division deployed to  Haiti as  part  of Operation  UI'1l0Ll)  DEMOCRACY.  Their missions  were  to  protect U.S.  citizens,  designated  Haitians  and  third  country  nationals,  and  U.S. interests  in Haiti;  restore  civil  order;  assist  in  the  reorganiz..1tion  of the Haitian armed forces; and assist  in  the transition to and the maintenance of a democratic government.  Peak  U.S. Army strength in  UI'IIOLD DEMOCRACY reached  18,401  soldiers on  13 October  1994. About  250 soldiers deployed to  Puerto  Rico  to  train  military personnel  from  Caribbean  Community and Common Market countrics in  prcparation  for  their deployment to  Haiti  as part of  a mult inational force  in  support of UPHOLD  DEMOCI {ACY.

On  31 March 1995,  the U.S.·  led multinational force  became  the United  Nations  Mission  in  Haiti  (UNM IH),  with  a  reduced  strength  of 6,000  troops, of whom  2,500  were  U.S.  soldiers.  The  UNM II-I is  autho› rized  by  United  Nations  Security  Counci l  Resolution  975,  which  was passed on 30 January  1995. The mission of the  UNM IH  was  to  help the government of Haiti  maintain a secure and stable cnvironment, dcvclop a public  security  force,  facilitate  thc  development  of a  functional  govern› ment, and assist in  the repatriation of Haitian migrants temporari Iy housed at  the U.S.  States  base at  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

In  January  1995,  units  of the  25th  Infantry  Division  deployed  from Hawaii  to  Haiti, replaci ng the  10th  Mountain  Division units on the island. Lalcr in FY 1995, Headqu&lt;lrlers, 2d ACR;  1  Sl  Squadron, 2d ACR; and two infant ry  companies  from  the  82d  Airborne  Division  relieved  the  25th Infantry  Division units.  Berore the end of  the fiscal  year, these units were relieved  in  turn  by  Headquarters,  1st  Brigade,  IOlst  Airborne  Division (Air Assault); 2d Squadron, 2d ACR; and two infantry companies from the 101 st Airborne Division.

As  part  of Operation  SEA  SIGNAL,  which  began  in FY 1994, Cuban and  I-Iaitian  migrants rescued at sea were housed in  temporary facilities at Guantanamo  Bay,  with  U.S.  Army  units  providing  security  and  support. These Army units included  1 brigade headquarters, 3 battalion headquar› ters,  23 security companies, and associated combat service support units, for  a  total  strengt h  or 3,900.  On  8  October  1994,  the 193d  Infantry Brigade (Light) and soldicrs from  U.S.  Army, South, opened a safe-haven

camp  in  Surinam  to  accommodate Cuban  mignmls from Guantanamo in support of Operation  DISTANT  H AVEN.  The Army's deployed  strength  in support  of DISTANT  HAVEN  reached  258 soldiers on  27  October  1994. At the height of  Opera  lion SEA  SIGNAL  in  FY  1 995, the migrant population al Guantanamo reached 21,638 Haitian and  32,780 Cuban migrants.

On  12 January  1995, in support  of Operation  SAFE  PASSAGE,  the 2d Brigade,  IOlst Airborne  Division (Air Assault), deployed  to  Panama 1 0 assist  in the hO llsing of  Cuban migrants. These migrants \vcrc moved from Guantanamo to  Panama all a temporary  basis to  reduce the migrant pop~ ulalion at Guantanamo. By the end of the fiscal year, the Army's commit~ menl at Guantanarno was about 800 soldiers.

In  October  1994, a brigade of the 24th Infan try  Division was airlifted to  Kuwait  as  part  of Operation  VIGILANT  WARRIOR.  The  mission  of this operation was to deter aggression from  Iraq. Within  seventy-two hours of its arrival , the brigade had drawn its equipment from stocks pre-positioned in  the country at  Camp  Doha,  and  had  moved  as a bailie-ready  force  to positions along  Kuwait's border with Iraq.  Other U.S. forces  followed  to link  up with equipment delivered to the region in  ships thai  had  been  pre› positioned at  Diego Garcia, a U.S.  Navy  installation  in  the  Indian Ocean. The Army's peak troop strength supporting V,GILANT WARRIOR  in  Kuwait reached 6,987 on 27 October 1994. Nearly all of  the deployed soldiers had returned to their home bases by the end of December  1994.

The Army deployed all  air defense artillery b&lt;ltlalion, a security com› pany,  and  maintenance  units  to  Saudi  Arabia  in  supporl  of Operation SounlERN WATCH  during FY  1995. The mission OfSOUTlIERN  WATCH  was to  enforce the no- ny zone Ihal  was established in  sout hern  Iraq in August 1992, barring all  Iraq i ai rcra ft  soulh  of the 32d  Parallel.  The  U.S.  Army also contributed to the security of the  region  by  twice deploying a heavy battalion task  force  to  participate  in  INTRINSIC  AcnON, a combined  exer› cise with  the  Kuwaiti  Army.

In support  of Operation  VIGILANT  SENTINEL,  the  1st  Battalion, 5th Cavalry,  1st Cavalry Division, arrived in  Kuwait on 26 August  1995. The battalion drew  equipment  from  the  prepositioned  stocks  maintained  al Camp Doha, and then moved to forward tactica l assembly areas and  par› ticipated  in  joint  and  combined  training  exercises  with the  Kuwaiti armed  forces.

In  South  America,  a  cease-fire  in  border  figluing  between  Ecuador and  Peru  was  negotiated  011 17  February  1995.  Under  the  terms of the cease-fire  agreement, the  two  belligerents  agreed  to  allow  Argentina, Brazil, Chile,  tllld  the  United States 10  deploy  Mi litary Observer Mission Ecuador and Peru (MOMEP) personnel to monitor troop withdrawals, ver› ify  unit  disposit ions,  and  report  violations of  the cease-fire  accord. Joint Task Force SAPE BORDER was established at Patllca, Ecuador, became fully

operational on  16 March  1995, and was still active althe end of FY  1995. The task force's mission is to provide aviation and logistical support to the MOMEP. The U.S.  Army's contribution  to  MOMEP consists of seventy› two soldiers and four  UH-60 Black Hawk  helicopters.

Throughout FY 1995,  Army personnel continued to support Operation  PROVIDE  COMFORT  as part of a  four-nation  task  force assigned to  deter further  Iraqi  aggression against  the  Kurdish  population  in  north› ern  Iraq.  The  U.S.  Army  provided  a  56-man  detachment  from  the  10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) for combat search and rescue operations. The  12th Aviation Brigade provided  an aviation element consisting of 28 soldiers,6 UH- 60  Black  Hawk  helicopters,  and  2 C- 12  aircraft  for  the administrative  and  logistical  support  of the  coalition  task  force. U.S. Army,  Europe, and Seventh Army provided the commander and staff offi› cers  for  PROVlDE COMFORT'S  military  coordination  center,  a  forward› deployed combined liaison clement at Zakhu, Iraq.

Other operations  supported  by  U.S.  Army  soldiers  during  FY 1995 included  Operation  PROVlDE  PROMISE  and  Operation  ABLE  SENTRY. In Operation PROVIDE  PROMISE,  soldiers deployed to Croatia  to support  hos› pital operations at Camp Pleso, located near Zagreb, Croatia. A U.S. Army battalion-size unit  has  been deployed  along the  Macedonia-Serbia border in  support of Operation ABLE  SENTRY  since  1993. The mission is to deter the spread of war in the region. In FY  1995, the 3d Battalion, 5th  Cavalry, I  st Armored  Division,  and  then  the  3d  Battalion, 12th Infantry, 1  st Armored Division, provided a 525-l11an task  force to support  the mission of Operation  AIJLE  SENTRY.  Each  task  force  was  relieved  after abollt  six months' service.

In Southeast Asia,  the U.S. Army continued to support Joint Task  Force FULL  ACCOUNTING  operations  throughout  the  fiscal year. Operating  in Vietnam,  Cambodia, and Laos, the joint task force  conducts investigations, excavations,  and  recovery  operations of the  remains  of servicemen  previ› ously  unaccounted-for during  the Vietnam  War.  The  U.S.  Army  has  fifty› two  soldiers  permanently assigned  to  Joint Task  Force  FU LL  ACCOUNTING and augments the joint task  force, as needed, with special teams ofmedical personnel, explosive ordnance disposal experts, and  technicians  from  the U.S. Army Central  Identification  Laboratory in Hawaii.

## COlfl1terc/rtlg Operations

The  Army's  commiunent  to  counterdrug  operations  continued  to ex.pand  in  FY  1995, and  it  remained an  effort  involving  both active  and reserve  components.  The  FY 1995  budgel  included  $250.4  million  for counterdrug support, and about 46,000 flying hours were programmed for support of  drug law enforcement agencies. More than 4,000 soldiers from

Regular Army,  USA R,  and  ARNG  units  provided  assistance  in  counter› drug operations. About  ninety-six soldiers and  Department  of the Army civilians  were assigned  to  countcrdrug joint task  forces during  the  fiscal year.  The Army  provided operational  support,  facil ities,  reconnaissance, maintenance,  intelligence  analysis,  linguistic  support,  engineering  sup› port, equipment, training, and planning support to  drug law enforcement agencies  in  the United Slates.  Support  for  training, aviation, intelligence, planning,  and  reconnaissance also was  provided  to  U.S.  federal  drug  law enforcement agencies operating in  foreign nations.  In FY  1995, Army sol› diers  supported  counterdrug  missions  in  nine  Latin  American  countries and  in selected Caribbean nations.  In addition to  these ongoing missions, the Army  also  supported requests from countries in Southeast  and Southwest Asia  for counterdrug training.

In  FY  1995,  the  Anny  lo.1ned,  leased,  or transferred  more  than  $ 179 million worth of  equipment to federal, state, and local drug law enforcement agencies. This equipment included such items as military  rifles,  shotguns, night  vision devices, vehicles, and  UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.

## Militmy Intelligence

In  May  1995,  the  Deputy Chief of Staff for  Intelligence  (DCSINT) established  the  Land  Information  Warfare  Activity  (L1WA)  in  the  U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. The L1WA' s mission is to pro› vide  support to  land component and Army commands to  faci litate plan› ning and  execution of Information Operations (10). Additionally,  LlWA enhances worldwide force protection by carrying out a proactive defense of Army  information  and  information  systems.  lOs are  actions  taken  to affect  adversary  and  other  information  and  information  systems  while defending one's own  information  and  information systems.  lOs are  both offensive and defensive in  nature. The elements of lOs include operations security,  military deception, psychological operations, electronic warfare, physical destruction, computer  network  attack,  computer  network defense, information  assurance, physical  security, counlerdeception, counterpropaganda,  counterintelligence,  public  affairs,  and  civil  affairs. The  LlWA  will  deploy  field  support  teams  to  support  land  component commanders. The field  support  teams  are  structured  to  fill  gaps  in  the command's 1 0 cell, provide connectivity to CONUS resident agencies and databases supporting lOs, and coordinate with the 10 cel ls at the joint task rorce or combatant command, as well as with the information warfare staff elements  from other  component commands  in  the  operational  area. Another  part of the  LlWA  is  the  Army  Computer Emergency  Response Team; its mission is to  support Army commanders worldwide in ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of  tile information and infor-

mation systems used  in planning, coordinating, directing, and controlling forces.  The  Ll WA  also operates the  threat  analysis clement of the Army Reprogramming and Analysis Team;  this element  identifies  and  reports changes in  worldwide signature information requiring  reprogramming of Army Target Sensing Systems software.

The president signed  Executive Order  12958, "Classified  National Security  Information," on  17 April  1995, mandating several changes in the  handling of  classified material,  most  notably the automatic declas› sification  of classified  materials  twenty-five  years  old  and  of pe nna› nen!  historical  va lue.  In  August  1995,  the  Director  of the  Army  Staff di rected  the  DCS INT  1 0  develop  and  promulgate  a  policy  for  imple› menting  the  executivc  order  within  the Army.  The  DCS INT  commis› sioncd a  study by a  private contractor to determinc the size and scope of the  problem and to  propose a  program  for the Army to comply  with the  mandates of the executive order. T he contractor found  that the task fac ing the Army is massive. The  service has over 270 mill ion  pages of affected  riles  dat ing  from 1900  to 1975.  There  are  no  cost-effecti ve automated aids available that can be employed effectively employed for the  material  dated  before  1975,  requiri ng  a  man ual  review  program. The  manual  review  program  wi ll req uire  more  than  750  personnel annually for the initial  five-year period. T he projected cost of the initial effort is $256 mi llion. The contractor recommended that the declassifi › ClItion  program be based in the  Mi litary District of Washi ngton because about  85  percent  of the  affected  ma terials  are  withi n  thi rty-five  miles of  the capital, and that the program be managed centrally to ensure con› sistency of effort and minimize the risk of inadvertent  release of mate› ria l that  should  remain classified.

Also  in  August  1995,  the  Director  of the  Army  Staff directed  the DCSINT to develop an  Army declassification  program  to  meet  both  the initial and long-term declassifica tion review requirements of  the executi ve order.  Classification  and  securi ty  marking  policies  werc  developed  by DCSINT  and  incorporated  into  the  revised  draft  of Army  Regulation 380- 5, Deparllllelll oflhe Army Illforma/ioll  Seclwily Program. This draft will  be reviewed  in the third quarter of FY  1996, and  the  fina l version of the regulation  is to be published in late FY  1996.

## NllcJem:  Biological.  and Chemical

During FY  1995, DCSOPS gained approval  from the Army leadership to  activate  d uring  FY  1996 a  Biodetection  Company  in  the  USAR.  This company wi ll  bc equipped  with  the  Biological Detection System (BIDS), the Army's fi rst  real biological warfare detection capability, developed as a result of lessons  learned during Operation  DESERT  STORM.  Because of the

imporlance of  acquiring this capability at the earliest  possible time, a pla› loon  of the  11th  Chemical Company,  an  active Army unit,  was  equipped during FY  1995 with BIDS as an  interim contingency capability.

## MiliUIIY Support 10  Civilian Authorities

The Army provided support to  federal  and Slate agencies in  the wake of the  19  April  1995  terrori st  bombing of the  Alfred  P.  Mu rrah  Federal Building  in  Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma. This support  included  structural and blast engineers from  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, medical evac› uat ion  helicopters,  bomb detection dog teams,  casualty assistance  teams, and mortuary affairs specialists. Army personnel also coordinated the air› lin of search and rescue teams, medical  personnel, and  Federal Bureau of Investigation  crime  vans.  Among those  who were killed  in  the  bombing were eight Army soldiers, civilians,  and family  members.

Army  units  and  personncl  provided  disaster  relief assistance  to  the U.S. Virgin  Islands aftcr Hurricane Marilyn struck on  13 September 1995. The support provided by the Army included ground transportation for dis· tribu tion  of relief supp lies,  logistical  support, an eighty·bed hospital, and facilities  and  equipment  to  assist  the  Federal  Emergency  Managemcnt Agency  (FEMA)  in  command  and  control  operations.  The  Corps  of Engineers conducted assessments and contracted for services and supplies totaling  more  than  $ 161 million. The  Corps  of Engineers  also  shi pped 50,000 gallons of  watcr each day to the islands, assisted in  the restoration of power, and supervised the  removal  of  debris.

## Reserve Forces

## Force Structure

Maintaining  the  Army's role  as  a  strategic  force  supporting  United Siaies  foreign  policy  requires  the  full integration  of Ihe  active  Army, ARNG,  and  USAR.  As  nceded.  the  ARNG  and  USAR  supply  highly trained units and individual soldiers to support operations. They also pro› vide  capabilities  not  needed  on  active duty  during  peacetime, at  signifi› cant  savi ngs. It is  crucial  that  the  Army  have  ready access  to  those units and individuals when the nation calls. To meet the needs of  the nation, the Army is  forging a  new balance alnong active, ARNG. and  USAR  forces. AI  the slart ofa contingency mission, active units will  form  the bulk ofa force, whi le  high-priority ARNG  and  USAR units  will  provide capabili› ties  not  found  in the act ive Army. As the operation continues, a larger pro› portion of forces will come from  the reserve components, which will sup› port deploying forces, backfill active  units and augment the  mobilization base,  reinforce  sustained  operations,  and,  if needed,  expand  the Army to meet a resurgent global  threat.

To  achieve this new  balance, the Secretary  of Defense announced, in December  1993, a  major restructuring plan  for  the Army's reserve  com› ponents.  Senior leaders of the active Army, ARNG,  USAR, and  the asso› ciations  representing  each  component's  members  had worked  out  an agreement that modified the reserve components' missions.  In addition to its  trad itiona l state and civil  mi ssions, the  ARNG generalty  would be ori› ented toward combat functions, and the USAR would be generalty orient› ed toward combat service support functions. The agreement will eliminate a  total  of 127,300  positions  from  the  reserve components  by  FY  1999, with theARNG's  end strength falling to 367,000 by FY  1999, and USAR's end strength falling to 208,000 by the end of FY  1998.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  most  USAR  aviation  assets  will  transfer  to  the  ARNG; some ARNG combat support and combat service supporlllnits will  trans› fer 10 the USAR components. Overalt, the agreement wi ll switch 128 units containing  11 ,062  authorizations  from  the  ARNG  to  the  USA R,  and  44 units containing  14,049 authori7    ations from the USAR to the ARNG. This .. transfer began in  FY  1994 with the ARNG receiving responsibility for all reserve component Special  Forces  units,  and  continued  during  FY  1995

with the transfer of morc than 8,000 positions between the ARNG and the USAR. The transfer of units  is projected to be complete in  FY  1997. The reserve components continued reducing force structure during FY  1995 to reach  Ihe  end  strengths  sct for  them  in the  OfT-Site  Agreemenl.  The ARNG inactivated  145 units with  17,700 positions, and the USAR inacti› vated 327 units with 25,323 positions.

The  USA R began the rcorgani:i'..&lt;'1lion of  its CONUS headquarters struc› ture in  accordance with a plan developed during FY  1994. The intent oflhc plan  is  to  reduce  the TDA  overhead  to  field  as  many deployable  force!; CI S possible by replaci ng the existing 20 Army  Reserve Commands (ARCOM) with J  0 Regional  Support  Commands  (RSC)  and  3  Regional  Support Groups  (RSG).  The  RSGs  will  be  assigned  to  the  three  RSCs  with  the largest numbers of troops or the  largest geographical span. Thc mission of the  RSCs  is  to  excrcise  command  and  control  of all  assigned  units and  to providc full  service support to atl  USAR units within their region, reduci ng the administrative workload  for deployable lInits and al lowing them to con› centrate on wartime missions. The RSCs will improve unit readiness by con› centrating a  higher percentage of full-time support  soldiers in  fewer  head› quarters. The  RSCs also will  improve  the ability of the  USAR to  provide military  support  to  civilian  authorities.  The  RSC  boundaries  correspond with  the  Standard  Federal  Region boundaries used  by all  federal agencies, including  the FEMA,  and  each  RSC  will  establish  State  Emergency Preparedness  Liaison  Offices  and Regional Emergency  Preparedness Liaison  Officers.  Ten  of the  current  ARCOMs  will be reorganized  into RSCs, 3 will  become RSGs, and 7 will be inactivated. A Garrison Support Unit  wi ll be created at  each of the  seven  inactivating ARCOMS.  Drawing on lessons learned in the Persian Gulf  War, these units will  improve the abil› ity of the  USAR to mobilize. Theil' mission is to  move to mobil ization sites before  other units  to  receive  them  and  prepare  them  for dcployment.  This rcorganization  will  be completed during FY  1996.

During  FY 1995,  the  ARNG  prepared  to  implement  the  enhanced brigades program. The  1993 DOD BOHom-Up  Review identified the  need for combat-ready reserve forces that would ensure the military's ability to win  nearly  two  simultaneous  major  regional  conflicts.  In  response,  the Army ended the practice of  designating ARNG brigades to "round out" or "round  up"  active  Army  divisions. Instead, fifteen  ARNG  enhanced brigades will  form the Army's principal  reserve component ground com› bat  maneuver  force.  The ARNG  selected  7  infantry  brigades,  5  mecha› nized infantry brigades, 2 armor brigades, and  1 armored cavalry regiment for this program. The ARNG selected  units  for enhanced status based on their readiness, modernization, manning, location, and past relations with active  Army  divisions. Seven  of  the  enhanced  brigades  were  former round-oul or round-up units. The readiness goal of the enhanced brigades

is  to be rcady to mobilize, train, ilnd deploy within  ninety days after call› up. The term "enhanced" refers to the increased resource and manning pri› orit ies  these brigades  will  enjoy to meet  their readiness goal.  Among  the resources committed to these brigades are resident teams of active Army soldiers who provide  advice,  assistance,  and planning  support. The enhanced brigades'  training and modernization programs will  begin  in  FY 1996 with the goal of  making them compatible with active Army divisions by  FY \ 999. The  remainder  of  the  ARNG's strategic  reserve  combat forccs8 divisions, 2 brigades, and  I infantry scout grou pwill  be struc› tured  ful ly but  will  nol  be  full y equ ipped or staffed.

At  the  end of FY  1995,  major units of the ARNG included 4 mecha› nizcd  infantry  divisions, 2 infantry divisions,  I  ligh t infantry division,  I armored division,  22  separate  infantry and armored  brigades,  I  armored cavalry  regiment,  2  special forces  groups,  and  I  infantry  scout  group. Major units  of the  USAR  included 9  training divisions, 5 exercise divi› sions, 9  medical  brigades, 43  hospital  units, 30  psychological operations units, 35 civil  affairs units, and  2 theater army area commands.

TheARNG's Force Management Directorate formed a Force XX I task force  in  Februa ry  1995.  The  mission  of the  task  force  is  to  servc  as  the focal point for the inclusion of  the ARNG as an integral  part of the Army's overall Force  XXI  campaign.  Since  the  creation  of the  Force  XX I task force, the ARNG  has  been actively  involved  in  virtually  every aspect of the  Force XXI campaign to ensure thai the ARNG  role in  Force XX I is a cohesive, comprehensive one.

In October 1994, Congress extended from 90 to 270 days the limits of involuntary  service  for  reserve  component units  called  to  active  duty under the  presidcntial  sclecti vc  reserve  call-up. This  ex tension  has  con› tributed to greater continuity, dcpendability, and integration oflhe reserve components into the conduct  of military operations.  The Army continues to  seek  congressional  authority  to  bring the  individuals of the  Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) under the presidential selective  reserve  call-up. The ability to  recall  members of lhe  IRR  is crit ical  to  aChieving total  person› nel readiness of deploying  units  in  a  variety of  operations. Access to  this essential component  is  presently  limited  to  periods  of declared  national emergencies and partial mobilization.

## Streng/Ii  alld Persollnel Management

ARNG's Selected Reserve FY  1995 end strength objective was 387,000 personnel, a decline of5.6 percent  from  FY  \994's  objective of  410,000 per› sonnel. The ARNG ended  FY  1 995 with a strength of 374,930 personnel96.9 percent of the objective.  USAR's FY  1995 end slrength  objective was 242,000, a decline of  6.3 percent from  FY  1994's objcclive of  260,000. The

USAR's ended  FY  1995  with  a  strength of 24 1,300---99.7  percent orthe objective. The USAR's IRR declined  12.1  percent, from  783,514 personnel assigned  in  FY  1 994 to  688,754 personnel assigned in  FY  1995.

In October 1994,  the Reserve  Officer  Personnel  Management  Act (ROPMA) became law. The Persian Gulf War had served to point  oul short› comings  in the  law  requiring  USAR  component officers to  compete,  upon call-up, for promotion  with aClive component officers. Also, it has been  nec› essary for the Congress to provide periodic relief in renewing expiring statu› tory  authorit ies  fo r  the  appointment,  promotion, and  separation  of USA R officers. ROPMA makes over  200 changes  to  existing  law  and  provides a comprehensive  management  system for  commissioned officers  not on  the Active Duty List. It is the counterpart to DOPMA, which governs the careers of  active duty commissioned officers, and includes the first major changes to the  laws  that govern  reserve  component  officers since  the  Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954.  Under  R OPMA, USAR componenl officers will  be accounted for on  the  Reserve  Active  Status  List, which  will  list officers  in each reserve componcnI  by  date  of  rank  for  purposes  of  promotion. Promotion boards will select officers using the "best qualified" instead of  the "fully qualified" criteria now  in use, allowi ng the reserve components to set selection ceilings where  officers  are  ranked on an order-of-merit  list. Officers will no longer be required 10 meet lime..-in-service standards for pro› motion.  Promotion  rates,  under ROPMA,  will  depend on the quotas set by the military departments based on the needs within each USAR component. Another provision regarding promotions is that officers will  not be &lt;lble  rou› tinely to delay &lt;I promotion for up  to  three years  while se&lt;lrching for a posi› tion in tlmt gnlde. An officer must apply for this del&lt;lY,  and  it is subject to the Service Secretary's approval.  If,  at any time duri ng the three-year period, the officer accepts  the  promotion,  the officer will  be  promoted  effective  upon date of acceptance.  R OPMA  will  take effect on 1 October 1 996. The ARNG and the USA R are now participating in the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense's ROPMA  Implementation W orking Group to revise DOD direc› tives and instructions so that the military services will  be able to develop the regu]&lt;ltions necessary to  implement ROPM A.

ARNG's new  enlisted  promotion  system  using  the  "Select-Train› Promote-Assign" methodology went through final staffing for full  field› ing  and  implementation in FY 1996.  As  each  state  fields  the  new  pro› motion system for each enlisted grade, it  will  select soldiers for  promo› tion  to  noncommissioned officer grades,  use  the  promotion selectee  list to enroll  the  soldiers  in the  NCOES courses required  for the promotion, and have the best qualified soldiers available for &lt;lssignment lo posilions immediately upon  identific&lt;ltion of leadership vacancies. The  new  pro· motion system allows the ARNG to make the best  usc or the vcry limit· ed  number of leadership training opportunities.

In October  1 994, thc ARNG opened three additional  military  occupa› tional  specialties12C. Engineer  Bridge  Crewlllcmbcr; 122,  Combat Engineer Senior Sergeant; and  82C.  Field Artillery Surveyorto  women and  implemented  a  change  to  the rute pertaining  to  the  assignment  of women. The change to the assignments rule opened about six to eight thou› sand positions that were closed previously to women  because of unit  mis› sions. TIle positions opened arc in chemical units, divisional military police uni ts,  maneuver brigade headquarters, and forward support battalions.

On  30 September  1995,  Congress  mandated  that  lieutenants  in  the USAR  components  have  a  bachelor's degree  before  being  promoted  to captain. The ARNG had earlier established a policy rcquiring that all those seeking to  enter Officer Candidate School must  have  sixty collcge credit hours before  entry,  and  that  officer candidates  must  have  ninety  college credit  hours  before  being  commissioned  as  a  second  lieutenant.  These policies will help to ensure that ARNG lieutenants meet this new require· men!. It is  also  the  ARNG  policy  Ihal  lieutenants complete  the  Officer Basic Course within two years of  commissioning.  In FY  1995, 74 percent of lieutenants  completed  this  requirement, a  2  percent  increase over the FY  1994 rate.

The most significant issue that affected full·time support  personnel in FY 1995  was  the  proposed  reduction  of military  technicians.  Military technicians are drilling reservists who are also federal civil ian employees hired  undcr  the  provisions  of either Title  5,  "Government  Organization and  Employees," or  Title 32, "National Guard," of  the United Stales Code. Military technicians arc  required,  as a  condition of their employment, to be  members of the Selected  Reserve  in  the  component they support and maintain  simultaneously  civil  service  status.  The  etTort  by  the  DOD  to reduce its civilian  work  force  resulted in  the removal  of barriers  protect· ing a number of  civilian personnel categories exempted previously, includ· ing military technicians. Military technician strength  reductions were pro· granllned consistent with  reductions in other DOD civilian personnel from FY  1995  through  FY 1999.  These  reductions  are  part  of  the  work-year limitat ions imposed by  the  Federal  Workforce  Restructuring Act of  1994. The  DOD's intention  to reduce civilian  end  strength posed a threat  to  the USAR  components' military  technician  program,  which  the  Army  felt enhanced unit readiness.

Despite force structure and end strength reductions, continuing equip· ment  modernization  initiatives  have  generated  technician  requi rements that  conti nue  to exceed authorizations.  The effects of the  DOD's civilian personnel reductions and the number of work years that  funding wi ll  sup› port  resulted  in  the  ARNG  being able  to  fund  only  25,238 of the  25,489 military  technician  positions  aut horized  by  Congress  in  FY 1995.  The fU lld ing shortfall  increased the need to util ize Volu ntary  Early Retirement

Authority and Voluntary Separation  Incentive  Pay programs as a manage› ment 1001 to reduce the technician  force. The reduction  in  military techni› cians, coupled with equipment  modernization, has resulted in  an  increase in  the maintenance backlog. This backlog has a direct impact on the equip› ment  readiness  of ARNG  and  USAR  units.  If future mi litary  technician reductions arc effected, ground  maintenance could  be faced  with  the clo› Slife of  organizational m'linlcnancc shops or foregoing equipment mainte› nance in  battaliolHizc organizations. Army aviation support  facilities thai provide  ful l-time  maintenance  personnel and  instructor pi loiS for ARNG aviation  units could sec manning levels fall  below 50 percent with techni› cian  reductions.  As  a  long-term  solu tion,  DOD  proposed  legislation  that would  establish  military  technicians  as  a  separate  category  of civil ian employees, not  to  be  included  in  general civilian  workforce reductions.

The Active  Guard  Reserve (AGR) program is another source of con› cern.  These  are ARNG  and  USAR  soldiers  who  serve  as  full-time  uni› formed personnel with reserve component units. The AG R program level of support  in FY 1995  was  59  percent.  Bctween  December  199 1 and December  1994,  the ARNG  had an AGR  hiring  freeze  to  ensure compli› ance  with  the  congressionally  directed  reduction  in AG R authorization levels.  In  FY  1995, the hiring freeze was lifted as the ARNG  Illetthe AG R authorization level through normal attrition and the use of transition  ben› efits such  as the Temporary Early Retirement program.  During FY  1995, a total  of  323 AG R I &gt;crsonnel of the ARNG  received approval for  reletlSe under Temporary  Emly  Retirement.  Since  FY  199 1,  however,  the  com› bined effects of the mandated reductions in AG R authorizations, thc AGR hiring  freeze  and  limits  on  controlled  grades  (those  senior  enlisted  and officer grades  whose  numbers  are  set by  Congress)  has stagnated career progression for many AGR soldiers. This has affected the states'  abi lity to fill  many entry  level AGR positions.

On  19 July 1995, the Secretary ofthcArmy designated the Army Career and Alumni  Program as an Army  Reinvention  Laboratory  to research and conduct  privatization  initiatives.  As  a  result  of thaI  designation, the  Chief, USAR, requested that the Army Career and Alumni Program conduct a one› year O I &gt;Cl'alionallest in  Europe  to determine the  feasibility of incorporati ng the  USAR  in-service  recruil'ing  functions  into  the  Job  Assistance  Center contract. [n  August  1995,  USAR  informed  ARNG  of the  proposed  test, explai ned the potential benefits, and invited them to participate.  The ARNG agreed to  the proposal, thus allowing the  test to cover both  reserve compo› nents.  Previollsly,  ARNG,  USAR, and  active Anny career counselors per› formed  in-service  recruiting functions.  The  Army  Career  and Alumni Program  will  assume  responsibility  for  the  Europe  reserve  mission  in  the second  quarter of FY  1996 and continue operations through the  first  quar› ter of FY  1 997. AI  the end ofthc test period, Army leaders will  analyze the

test  results  and  decide  whether  to  continue  using  contractor  personnel to perform the in-service recruiting functions.

## Training and Readiness

During FY  1995, the service continued to implement the provisions of Tille  Xl  of  the  FY  1993  National  Defense  Authorization Act (also called the Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992), provi› sions that  the  Army  decided 10  apply also  to early deploying  uni ts of the USAR.  The  Army  implements  these  requirements  by  several  means. It continues the  BOLO  SHIFT  program, instituted in  FY  1992, which  focuses on  improving  individual, collective, and  leader training.  Also continui ng is the  Operational  Readiness  Evaluation  progmm,  in  which  the  Army headquarters in  Ihe  CONUS send teams to inspect the training and  readi› ness  of reserve component  units  in  their  areas.  Section  11 32  of Title  XI directed  the  Army  to  expand  the Active  Component  Support to  Reserve Component program from 2,000 active duty personnel to 5,000 personnel. These active duty personnel serve as full-time advisers to selected ARNG and  USAR units.  During FY  1995, the Army began assigning additional active Army personnel to this duty, and expects to have all 5,000 positions filled  by the cnd ofFY 1997.

Another congressionally mandated program is Simulation in Training for Advanced Readiness (SIMITAR), established in  1992 as ajoint ARNG and  Advanced Research Projects Agency  (ARPA) effort. SIMITAR applies advanced technology to  increase training levels of  ARNG round› out and round-up brigades. The objective of SIMI  TAR is to achieve a 200 to  300 percent increase in  unit  training  readiness when compared to thaI reported  in  thc  Persian  Gulf War  mobilization.  Two  brigades,  the  48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), Georgia ARNG, and the  11 6th Armored Brigade,ldaho ARNG, are being used to test SIMITAR. The first view of SIMITAR's potential came  during  the  116th  Armored  Brigade's annual train ing  in  1995.  On  the  second  day  of annual  training,  71 percent  of crews  of a  tank  company  qualified  on Tank  Table  VIII,  a  considerable achievement of  crew preparedness and marksmanship. Later during annu› altraining, no platoon in  the battalion fa iled any tactical evaluation phase. The  48th  and  116th  Brigades  arc  scheduled  for  NTC  rotations  in  FYs 1996 and  1997, respectively,  and it  is hoped that thcse rotations will  vali› date  the  SIM ITAR  training methodologies. The ARNG also began  field› ing other training  simulators  during the year: the Abrams-Ful1crew Interactive  Simulation  Trainer,  the  Engagement  Skills  Trainer,  and  the Guard Unit Armory Device FulIcrew Interactive Simulation Trainer 1 1.

The number of ARNG soldiers receiving  individual  skills or profes› sional  development  training  is  affected  adversely  by  geographic  disper-

sian, competing civilian  employment demands,  and  travel  costs. The  FY 1995  National Defense Authorization Act directed the ARNG  to establ ish a di stance learning demonstration project to determine whether the appli› cation of  multiple media and emerging technologies could overcome these adverse factors and, Ihus, improve individual and  unit readiness. Demonstration  sites  were selected  in  Maryland,  P ennsylvania,  Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of  Columbia. Contracts have been awarded for installation of  nine classrooms, and projected completion  is scheduled for the th ird quarter of FY  1996.

During  FY  1995, the  USAR continued its efforts to  improve its training divisions.  The  five  exercise divisions  more  than  doubled  in  size,  in  accor› dance with  a plan  developed  in  FY  1994. These divisions help train  USAR and ARNG combat support and service support units, and will  assist in unit validation during  mobilization. The  USAR  began  to reorganize  its Instihltional Training (IT) divisions. The missions of IT divisions are initial entry  training  of new soldiers,  military  occupational  specialty  reclassifica› tion traini ng, and refresher training. The 9 existing IT divisions will  be reor› ganized into 7 divisions, and these will be aligned with TRADOC's 7 region› al  school  systems.  Command  and  control  of U.S.  Army  Reserve  Forces schools, currently part of  ARCOMs, will be shifted to the seven IT divisions. The  reorganization  will  reduce  the  total  number of soldiers  assigned  to  IT divisions by 23  percent, and is expected 10 be completed by October  1 996.

ARNG continued to consolidate its Officer Candidate School Phase I II training  with the ROTC  Advanced  Camps  conducted  at Fort Lewis, Washington,  and  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina. The  consolidation  of this train ing capi talized on the considerable assets devol"ed to the conduct of the training camps,  producing an  alignment of the two programs of instruction to  further  standardize  thc  instruction  and  facilitate  accreditation  without sacrificing quality.  More than 900 candidates attended the two-week camp phase in  FY  1995, and a similar number is expected in FY  1996.

Several  ARNG combat units underwent training offered at the Army CTC.  The  staffs  of  the  29th Infantry Division  (Light)  and  the  49th Armored  Division  participated  in  the  BCTP.  The  53d  Separate  Infantry Brigade conducted a  rotation at the Joint  Readiness Training Center. The 256th Separate Infantry Brigade had been scheduled to conduct a rotation at  NTC but  it, instead, conducted a CTC-like rotation at Fort  Hood, Texas. The  Louisiana ARNG, the NGB, and FORSCOM made this change joint~ ly to  test the  feaS ibi lity of  a CTC-like exercise and to  document the costs associated with  such an operation.

Adequately funding the ARNG's flying hour program continued to be a  readiness challenge  in  FY 1995.  Flying  hours  and  the  corresponding fu nding  for  add itional  flig ht  training  periods ensure  combat  readiness as well  as  minimum  levels  of aviator  proficiency  and  safety.  Because  of a

shortage of flight simulators, the ARNG  is  developing an aviation recon› figurablc manned simulator (ARMS) as a cost-effective solution that will enhance safely and  readiness  through  simulation.  The ARMS  is  a  flight simulator  that  can  be  reconfigured  to  simulate  each  of the  rotary  and fixed-wing  aircraft  flown  by  ARNG. It is  a  high  fidcJity,  110n- molioo› based  simulator  that  will  usc  government  and  commercial  off-the-shelf technology.  Each ARMS provides exposure to individual and crew train› ing  tasks  and  focuses  on  collective,  combined  arms,  and  joint  service training  operations.  Rcconfigurable  simulators  such  as  ARMS  comple› ment existing  older  tech nology  and  will  provide Army  and  ARNG  air› crews  the  critical training  envi ronments  not  expected  to  be  available because of the expense of the aircraft and training costs.

## Mobilization

In  response to a presidential call-up, ARNG and  USAR provided sol› diers to support operations in Haiti during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. The initial contribution was 800 personnel: 400 ARNG mil› itary police, 270 USAR civil affairs and psychological operations special› ists, 90  USAR  medical  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentees,  and  40 USAR transportation specialists.  The development of plans for sustained operations in Haiti  in  October  1994 led the Army to  request an additional call-up,  which  the  Secretary  of Defense authorized on  17  October  1994. A  total  of 2,093  ARNG  and  USAR  personnel  were  subsequently  mobi› lized for the operation, including ARNG Special Forces and aviation units.

In  FY  1994, because of troop cuts  and an  incretlse  in  missions  that strained  the active Army's resources,  the Army  decided to  create a  com› posite unit specifically  to participate  as  part  of the United  Nations' Multinational Forces and Observers that patrols the Sinai  peninsula, sep› arating Egypt  and Israel.  This  would  ease the strain on active Army divi› SiOIlS,  which had been supplying the infantry battalions used on these six› month  deployments.  Active  Army,  ARNG,  and  USAR  personnel  joined together to form  the unit, designated as the 4th  Battalion, 5051h  Parachute Infantry Regiment. The ARNG and USAR personnel  were all  volunteers, and three limes more reserve component personnel volunteered than were needed  for  the  task  force.  Most  of the ARNG  volunteers  came  from  the 29th  Infantry  Division (Light).  Of the soldiers assigned to the task  force, 383  came  from  ARNG  units and 42  were  from  USAR  units  or the  IRR. Under the supervision of the 82d Airborne Division, the task  force began tmining at  Fort  Bragg, North Carolina, in August  1994. It deployed to the Sinai in  January  1995 and returned 10  the United States in July  1995. The Department of the Army  is evaluating  the  results of this deployment  for possible  future  rotat ions of this type.

During FY  1995, a total of 22,661 ARNG and  17,432 USAR soldiers trained overseas, participated in  exercises, or provided mission support to the  overseas  combatant  commands.  Examples  of these activities  include training at  the Army's Jungle  Operalions Training Center;  Humanitarian and Civic Assistance actions; military police providing rorce protection at European  Command's  Retrograde  of ATLANTIC

installations around  the world; Equipment program; and Joint Chiefs of Staff exercises such as FUERTES CAMINOS,  FUERTES UNIDAS. FUERTES DEFENZAS, BRIGHT STAR, RESOLVE, TRADEWINDS,  ULCHI FocuS LENS, KEEN  EDGE,  and NORTHWINI).

[n FY  1995,  the ARNG  participated  in  European  Command's Joint Contact Team  Program  under the  auspices of the  NGB State Partnership Program. Traveling  contact  teams,  seminar  participants,  and  state  adj u› tants  general  and  state  governors  visited  central  European  and  former Soviet  Union countries.  ARNG  soldiers provided  instruction  on  mi litary support  to civil  authorities  in  planning and  responding  to  civil  emergen› cies and disasters.  Other areas of special  interest to the representatives of the central  European and  fonner Soviet Union countries were  recruiting, retention, and training of their  reserve forces and  mobilization to support active  Army  forces. In  support  of this  program,  about  220  guardsmen deployed  in FY 1995  to  Albania,  Belarus,  Bulgaria,  Czech  Republic, Estonia,  Hungary,  Kazakhst:.m,  Latvia,  Lithuania,  Macedonia,  Moldova, Poland, the  Republic of  Georgia,  Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

In addition to the Joi nt Contact  Team  Program,  the NGB  State Partncrship Program also supported PFP events in  FY  1995. ARNG sup› ported events such as the hosting of familiarization and observation tours for representatives of  the Czech Republic,  Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Republic of  Georgia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Ukraine. Subject areas included Staff Judge Advocate interaction with the  military and civilian community,  observation of ARNG  units' annual training,  and  military  support  to  civi l  authorities.  The  State  Partnership Program  also  hosted  a National Interagency Counterdrug Insti tute Seminar on mil itary support to civil authorities for forly participants from central European and former Soviet Union countries.

## Reserve Componelll Support to  Civilian Authorities

The ARNG and the  USAR continued to slipport iocal, siale, and fed› eral  drug law enforcement agencies (DLEA) in eradicating and interdict› ing  illegal  drug opemlions during FY  1995.  Nationwide supporlto COIll› munity-based organizations in  their efforts to reduce the demand for ille› gal drug use and substance abuse, particularly among the youth, also con› tinued throughout FY  1995. The ARNG conducted more than 6,788 erad› ication and interdiction operations in  support of  state and federal  DLEAs.

Of these operations, 67 percent supported state-level, and 33 percent fed› eral-level, DLEAs. There were significant increases in the amount of  cash confiscal'ed,  the  number  of  marijuana  plants  destroyed,  the  amount  of hashish seized,  and  the number of drug-related arrests made. The ARNG supported  more  than  8,100  community-based  drug  reduction  activities. These activities were  focused on anti-drug and anti- substance abuse edu› cation and  training  programs  for  the  youths  of the  community,  but  also included efforts aimed at  improving  self-esteem and  emphasizing educa› ti onal  growth.  The types  of activities  conducted  included  building  com› munity coalitions, promoting anti-drug messages, creating youth encamp~ ments, providing engineering support, and developing leadership and fos› tering  fam ily  values. These community-based programs reached  nearly 8 million  people during the fiscal  year.

USAR  personnel  provided  medical  evacuation  support  to  ground operations, heavy lift support, and aviation support  to  the ARNG  and  the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). USAR units also provided trans› portation support 1 0  numerous  local and federal  drug enforcement agen~ cies  duri ng  the  fiscal  year.  The  USAR  participated  in  several  anti-drug intelligence operations: tactical  analysis support to federal agencies regarding drug traffiCking and money laundering, strategic studies of  drug trafficking  and  organized  crime  affecting  governments  in developing countries and the former Soviet  Union, intelligence analysis for the  DEA and  American  embassies  and  linguists  to  translate  foreign  documents relating 10  narcotics trafficking, and gang activities in the United States.

During FY  1995, a daily average of 1,048 ARNG personnel were on state  active duty  responding  to  requests  for assistance exclusive of those conducting  anti-drug operations. The  major natural  disasters  during  FY 1995  were  Hurricane Erin  in  Florida  and Alabama,  Hurricane  Marilyn in Pucrto Rico  and  the U.S. Virgin Islands, flooding in Missouri and California, and forest  fires in several states.  Oklahoma ARNG, along with other  mil itary  and  local,  state,  and  federal agencies,  provided  disaster relief and security and  law  enforcement assistance following the  19 April 1995  terrorist  bombing of the  Murrah  federal  building  in  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Puerto Rico ARNG personnel provided law enforcement assis~ tance to local  law  enforcement agencies combating crime in  metropolitan areas  on  the  island.  More  than  348,332  man-days  were  expended  in  the conduct of these emergency response missions.

The joint ARNG and Air National Guard (ANG) GUARDCARE pro~ gram provided guardsmen with hands-on medical sustainment training for wartime  readiness  as  it  assisted  medically  lInderserved  communities  in twelve states during FY  1995. Another joint Army and ANG  program was CAREFORCE, which has guard medical personnel serving in  the trauma centers  and  emergency  rooms  of underserved  American  communities.

This program provides additional  medical resources to  these communities and  improves the readiness of  guard  medical personnel 10 respond to mass casualty situations. CAREFORCE also served as a test base for MERLIN, a distance-learning forum  for trauma and casualty management.

In  1992, Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense, acting through the Chief of the NGB, to conduct a three-year pilot program to  be known as  "National  Guard  Civilian  Youth  Opportunities  Program"  to  determine whether the  life skills and employment potential  of civilian youth who are high school dropouts can be improved significantly through military-based training  that  incl udes  supervised  work  experience  in  community  service and conservation  projects, and whether it  is  feasible and cost effective for the ARNG to provide this training.  In June  1993, the ChalleNGe program began in  ten states.  ChalleNGe is an ARNG 22-wcek, quasi-military, resi› dential program for drug free,  16- to  18-year old high school dropouts who are unemployed and not currently involved with the legal system. The res› idential  phase  is  followed  by  a  twelve-month  post-residential  mentoring period.  Program core components are academic ex.cellence (GED attain› ment),  leadership  and  followership,  citizenshi p,  community  service,  life coping skills, job skills,  physical  fitness,  and  health  and  hygiene.  Subject to  program  fundi ng  levels,  successful  complction  of thc  residential phase entitles graduates up to a $2,200 stipend if  the graduate goes on  to col lcgc, vocational-technical  institutions, a job, or returns  to  school.  In  FY  1995, the ChalleNGe program operated in fifteen states.

ARNG and USAR units  and  personnel participated  in  several  other domestic missions during FY  1995. In REEF-Ex,  USAR and ARNG units demilitarized and cleaned obsolete tanks, and then moved them by rail to ports.  The  tanks  then  were  taken  by  barge  out  to  sea  where  they  were dumped to build artificial  reefs in coastal waters.  In conjunction with the reserve  components  of the other services,  ARNG  and  USAR  personnel received  readiness trai ning through several  medical and engineering pro› jects in  Native American communities.

## Equipment and Maintenallce

Cuts  in  the  active  Army's force  structure  have  released  significant amounts of equipment for the ARNG and the USAR. The transfer of this equipment enhances ARNG  and  USAR  unit readiness and compatibility with  Regular Anny  units.  In  FY  1995, the ARNG  received 451  Abrams tanks,  224  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicles,  and  58  Multiple  Launch  Rocket Systems,  replacing  M60  tanks,  M 113  series armored  personnel  carriers, and M 110A2  8-inch  howitzcrs,  respectively. More  than  6,000  Single Channel  Ground  and  Airborne Radio  Systems  (SINCGARS)  were received  to  replace Vietnam-era  l2-series radio systems. The majority of

these  items  came  from the  redistribution  of equi pment  from  the  Regular Army.  Equipment transferred to  the  USAR included  trucks,  I-I MMWVs, M 16A2 rifles, and rough terrain cranes.

The  Return  of Materiel  from  Europe  program,  begun  in  FY 1993, continues  to  provide  a  major opportunity to  fill  equipment  shortages  in reserve  component  units,  especially for  combat  units. In Europe,  308 USAR soldiers prepared materiel for shipment to the United Slates.  Most of the equipment needing repair is sent to  five ARNG repair sites, which received  more  than  9,000  vehicles and  brought  nearly 4,000 to  requi red standards for  issue.

Modernization  of the  ARNG  aviation  fleet  is  a  major concern.  The ARNG's  aging  UH- J  Hs  must  be replaced,  especially those  in early deploying  medical  evacuation units.  Current Army  UH- 60  procurement contracts  end  in FY  1996  and  wil l  leave  the  ARNG  with  a  significant shortfall  in  this  area.  Du ring  FY  1995,  the ARNG  received  4  add itional CH-47D transport  helicoptcrs,  bringing  its  CH-47D fleet  to  107  of the 131  aircraft  requ ircd.  The  remaini ng  twenty·four CI-I-47Ds  will  be  pro· vided by FY  1997 through redistribution  from active component units and Ihree  production  aircraft  deliveries.  During  FY 1995, a 1 0lal of eighteen AH-64 attack helicopters were distributed among units in Soulh Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and  Utah. These helicopters had previolls· Iy been  assigned  to  active  component  units  of III  Corps  al  Fort  Hood, Texas.  Damage  to  these  helicopters  from  a  windstorm  Illld  necessitated extensive  repairs  and,  after  the  repairs  were  completed,  the  hel icopters were transferred to the ARNG units. The ARNG will  receive an addition· al six  AH- 64  aircraft  through  active  component  redistribution  by  FY 1997, leaving a shortage of  eighteen AH- 64 aircraft.

National Guard and Reserve Equipment Appropriations (NGREA) arc funds  appropriated  by  Congress  specifically  for  the  purchase  of equip· ment  for  the  ARNG  components  of the  military  services.  [n  FY  1995, major  items  received  by  the  ARNG  through  NGREA  funds  included UH- 60  helicopters,  UH- 60Q  modification  kits,  fuel  and  dump  trucks, and  reverse osmosis water purification  kits.  Major items  received  by the USAR through NGREA funds included C- 12 aircraft, tugboats, M984A 1 wreckers. M871  semitrailers, and AN/PVS- 7B night vision goggles.

The trend in procurement for the reserve components during FY  1995 continued  to  focus  on  combat  and  combat  support  systems,  benefiting mostly  the ARNG. The  USA R had  major equipment shortages during FY 1995;  these had a significarll  negative effect  on  the  readiness of its  uni ts. About 27  percent  of  the USAR  was not deployable because of  equipment shortages, with  13 percent of  the planned early deploying units having sig· nificar ll problems. These shortages include communications and electron· ics  equipment,  medical  equipment,  power  generation  equipment,  water

purification equipment, combat support equipment, and line haul tractors. Efforts to address this problem will  focus on four areas:  targeted procure› ment,  the  redistribution  of equipment,  the  dedicated  procurement  pro› gram, and an  increase in  depot maintenance funding.

Automated  logistics  management systems  promise  to  reduce  delays and  improve  the  efficiency  of logistics operations.  However.  insutTicient funding  is  slowing  the fielding of  the  Standard  Army  Management Information System, which will allow the digitization of  the logistics sup› port  system. This  shortfall  is especially  worrisome in  the  USAR,  which currently  operates  with  two  logistics  programs  that  are  not  compatible with  active Army systems.

Because most  USAR  facilities arc not  located near military  installa› tions, depending on these installations for many services is neither practi› cal  nor  economical.  During  FY 1995,  the  USAR  thus  began  testing  a "shop smart" program in  the  125th ARCOM. This program allows USAR units  to  shop  around  for  the  best  value  in  maintenance  and  self-service supplies, thus  reducing  the  time  it  takes  to  acquire  these  items  and  ser› vices and saving money.  On the basis of  the positive results of  the test, the USAR hopes to expand the program to other commands in  FY  1996.

## Logistics

## Management and Planning

Power projection in  support of the national military strategy requires building the most effective logistics system with  the  flexibility  to  sustain the force throughout a full  spectrum of potential operational scenarios. As the  Army  evolves  from  an industrial~agc to  an infonnation~age force, logistics must evolve  in  concert with other arms to provide essential sup› port. To  guide Army  logistics  into  the  twenty-first  century,  the  Chief of Staff,  Army,  issued  a  memorandum  on  14  October  1994  outlining  the Army  Strategic  Logistics  Plan  (ASLP);  the  ASLP  was  published  on  28 February  1995. The ASLP is under the direction of DCSLOG.

The ASLP is based on  the  concepts  and business  plans of the Army Materiel  Command (AMC), Training and Doctrine Command Pamphlets 525-5, Force XX1  Operations, and  525- 200-6, Combat Service Support. The ASLP supports the Chief of Staff, Army,  Force XXI Campaign Plan and  the  Secretary  of Defense's Logistics  Strategic  Plan,  and  is  aligned with the specific  initiatives  in  those  plans.  The  plan  consolidates  into  a single logistic planning document the Army's logistics initiatives and poli› cies,  and  the  strategic  visions  of DCSLOG;  the  Commandcr, AMC; and the  Commander,  U.S.  Army  Combined Arms  Support Command  (CAS› COM). It is  also the  primary source of logistics input to the  PPBES. The ASLP is the logistics annex to  the Army's Force XX I Campaign Plan and, in that  capacity,  tics  logistics  ini tiatives  to Force  XX I  milestones  and advanced  warfighting  experiments.  The  ASLP  also  provides  details  on specific  functions and relations among members of the  logistics commu› nity,  specifically  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief of Staff for  Logistics (ODCSLOG), AMC. and CASCOM. The plan will change as the logistics requirements of the service changc. Fundamental to  the provisions of the ASLP is frequent review and oversight at the general officer level.

Just as the overall  Force XX I initiative defines three axes for reaching the  twenty-first century  force, the ASLP structures the transformation of logistics  along three axes. The  DCSLOG,  acting  in support  of  the DCSOPS role as the overall Army Staff integrator, provides logistics pol› icy, prioritization,  guidance,  and  resourcing  across  thc  threc  axes,  and ensures that logistics capabilities are synchronized and consistent with the

Force XX I Campaign Plan. The main axis of the  logistics restructuring is the  redesign  of the  logistics  support  st ructures  of the operational  Army. This is to be undertaken with CASCOM as the  lead agency. AMC has the lead  for  the  second  ax is,  the  rcengineering  of the  institutional and TDA Army as it pertains to  logistics. The Director, Plans and Operations, ODC· SLOG, has Ihe  lead  for  the  third  ax is,  Ihe  introduction  of modern  infor› mation technology to the  logistics part of the baulcspace.

After Ihe  Persian Gulf War,  Congress charged the  DOD to  determine strategic  mobility requirements  in  response to both the changing  interna› tional  situation  and  a  rev ision  of the  nat ional  mi litary  strategy  that  calls for  fewer  forwardwdeployed  forces  and  more  rcliance  on  forces  based  in CONUS.  The  congressionally  mandated 1992  Mobility  Requirements Study  concluded  that  the  military  could  increase  its  deployability  only through  investment  in  sealifl,  airlift,  prewpositioning,  and  transportation infrastructure. Since that study,  the Army has been  reorganizing its Army War  Reserves  (AWR)  and  distributing  them  in  strategic  commonwuser stockpiles that support multiple regional commanders in  chief.  In October 1994,  AMC  assumed  the  responsibi lity  for  management  of all  AWRs. There are five geographic sets of  AWRs: AWR- I is in  CONUS, storcd in depots; AWR- 2 is maintained in  Europe; AWR- 3 is stored aboard ships as the  Army  Prewpositioned Afloat (A PA)  package; AWR-4  is  in Korea and Japan; and AWR- 5 consists of equipment  sets and  supplies  for  a  heavy brigade stored in  Kuwait.  During Opcration VIGILANT WARRIOR, a brigade of the 24th Infantry  Division (Mechanized) drew the AWR- 5  brigadc set and  trained with  it  from  October to  December  1994.  In  September  1995, Army Central Command and AMC began working to expand AWR- 5 by establishing a second brigade sel in Qatar.

In FY  1994, the Army established an interim APA  package to respond to major  regional contingencies.  The  ptlckage  consisted  of an  armor brigade set of equipment  with  doctrinal  field  arti llery,  combat  engineer, air defense arti llery, chemical, signal,  logistics,  and  mi li tary  intelligence support.  Corpsand  division-level  combat  support  and  combat  service support  uni t sets of equipment and fifteen  days of supply were  also pre› positioned. These corps- and division-level sets provide equipment that, in addition  to  its  wartime  role,  could  be  used  10  aid  in  di saster  relief and humanitarian  assistance  efforts.  TRADOC  is  completing  Field  Manual J 00- 17- 1, Arm)' Pre-positioned  Afloat; publication  is expected during FY 1996. In  FY  1995. the Army validated theAPA concept by equipping from AWR- 3  a  heavy  brigade  and  a  corps  support  group  that  deployed  to Kuwait for Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR.  During the opcration, AMC and clements  of the  24\h  Infantry  Division  (Mechanized)  rcconfigured  the equipment sets  from  pure  infantry and armor battalions to battalion task forces. This reconfigur3tion will  provide more nexibility by allowing the

deployment of battalion-size combined  arms task  force  packages. These packages and other stocks in  AWR- 3 wi ll  be reloaded on  large, mcdium› speed  roll-onlroll-ofT ships starling  in  FY 1996,  improving maintenance capability while anoat and shortening the APA's response time.

Improvements  in  the  Army's installation  infrastructure  in  FY 1995 included  the  upgrading  of mill incs,  access  roads,  and  loadi ng  facil ities. plus the purchasing of  additional railcars and containers. Also, by improv› ing its in formation  in frastructure  with  advanced  communications,  the Army increased  its  asset visibi lity  and  logistical efficiency. allowing  the Army to manage  its equipment distribution  from  factory 10  foxho le.

Logistics  automation  accomplishments  in FY 1995  came  under  an overarching initiative  called  velocity  managementimproving the  speed and accuracy with which  materiel and  information  now through the  dis› tri bu tion  system.  Veloci ty  management  centers  on  two  key  principles: simplifying the  logistics  processes and  substituting  velocity  for  massive inventory.  The key characteristic of the futu re Force XX I logistics system is  responsivenessrapidly  and  accurately  meeting the  needs of soldiers and their commanders.  Underlying the velocity management approach is a process-oriented view of  the Army logistics system. This view holds that the Army logistics system, like all  systems, can  be described  fundamen› ta lly in  terms  of inputs, outputs,  and  the  process  that  transforms  inputs into the desired outputs  for the system's customer.  Velocity  management stresses  faster  cycle  times  for  all  processes  by  reducing  or  eliminat ing waste and  wait  times,  and  reducing  the  logistics  syslem's large  resou rce invcstment by pcrmitting lowcr inventory levels.

In FY  1995, ODCSLOG began a pilot velocity management program that  concentrated  on  Class  IX  repair  parts  for  high-value  weapons  sys› tems. The major weapons systems selected for the pi lot program wcrc the AH- 64 Apache and  UH- 60  Black  Hawk helicopters, thc  MIA I Abrams tank, and the Multiple Launch Rocket System. The initial phase of  Army› wide implementation is scheduled to begin  in FY 1996 and to continue for the next fOllr to  fivc  years.

Total asset visi bil ity (TAV) allows the Army to track supplies and equip› ment  from  factory  to  battlcfield,  and  is  designed  10  speed  up  logistics processes and  to  savc money.  Managers are able to  keep track  of the  loca› tion,  quantity, condition, and  movement of assets  through  thc  distribution systelll.  A critical  component ofTAV  is  in-transit  visibility,  which  allows managcrs to  track  materiel  moving  between  storage  locations or vendors. Radio frequency tags affixed to the materiel being shipped generatc signals that  are  picked  lip  by  fixed  and  hand-held detect ion  devices and  by com› puter-satellite  li nks.  During Operation  UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY,  critical cargo was  tracked  from  Ihe  New  Cumberland  Anny  Depot  in  Pennsylvania  to Haiti. FORSCOM  used  TAV  successfully  as  il  redistributed  equipment

made excess  by base  closures,  force  reductions,  and  the  withdrawal from Somalia.  Currently.  TAV  provides  Army  managers  with  the  locations  of 31  [,482 Army-owned items ofmutericl  from all classes of  supply, including war reserve  stocks pre-positioned  both onshore and on  ships. The Army is now establishing TAV  in Europe,  Korea, and the  XVI II Airborne Corps.

In  FY 1995,  DCSLOG  identified  several  special  interest  items  to evaluate during  the  fi scal  year.  Muni tions accountabi lity  and  reporti ng was a special interest item for DCSLOG inspectors. Their primary focus was on  man-portable, nonnuclear missiles and rockets in  a ready-Io-fire configuration, considered to  be  Security  Risk Category  I (CAT  I). The inspectors sought to determine whether Army ammunition supply points managed effectively the receipt, issue, and turn-in o f training munitions; ammunition supply  points or units  accounted adequately  for munitions on  the  stock  record  account  or  unit  property  books;  and  the  physical security of  CAT  I munitions was maintained  properly.  The results of the review by  DCS LOG  personnel revealed  that only one of eight ammuni› tion  supply  points  visited  was  not  managing  effectively  its  munitions. The problems of that  unit  stemmed  from  a computer system failure.  An inventory  of 7,268  CAT  I  missiles  and  rockets  revealed  inadequate accountability of these  munitions  in only  one  property  book,  although some  discrepancies  were  noted  in  other  property  books  reviewcd. The physical  securi ty  of CAT  I  ammunition  was  adequate  at  most  of the installations visited.

Another special interest item of DCSLOG inspectors during the  fi s› cal  year was  the  management  of small-arms repair parts by commands and installations. The objective of  Ihe review was to determine whether commands and installations were follow ing policy directives and secu› rity guidance in  the management of small-arms repair parts within their supply  support  activities  (SSA),  support  maintenance  element  shops and  bench  slocks,  and  uni t  arms  rooms.  During  FY 1995,  DCSLOG personnel  visited  Ihirty-three SSAs.  Eight  of the  sites  had  forma l pro› cedures that provided  for  the  SSA's manager to  review  all  small-arms parts  requisitions  to  ensure  that  the  requisitioner  was  ordering  parts commensurate  with the unit 's authorized level ofrcpair. The remaining twenty-five SSAs had either informal  procedures or some  type of lim› ited procedure to monitor  selected  small-arms parts requisitions. During their  visits  to  various  commands  and  installations,  DCS LOG personnel reviewed small-;' \rms parts accountabi lity and location records  for acc uracy at thirty SSAs. Accountabil ity records reviewed at twenty-seven SSAs met or exceeded the prescribed accuracy rate o f 85 percent. The three SSAs below standard had accuracy rates that ranged from  50 to 80 percent.  All  thi rty SSAs met or exceeded  the  prescribed 95  percent  location accuracy  rate.

Personnel  from  DCSLOG  visited thirty~scvcn direct  support  units and  found  most were maintaining small-arms repair parts in  either shop stock  or bench stock, or both. One activity did not  keep any small  arms repair pariS  in  either shop stock or bench stock.  Instead, parts were req› uisitioned  from  the collocated SSA as needed to complete work  orders. Shop  stock  item accountabi lity records  and location records were reviewed for accuracy at twenty-one direct support units, with seventeen units  achieving  an  accuracy  rate  of  85  percent  or better.  The  accuracy rate of  the  four  units  that  fell  below  the  standard  ranged  from  60 to  80 percent.  The location  records at  sixteen of the twenty-one direct support units visited  received  an  accuracy rating of 100  percent.  The  five  units below standard  had accuracy rates that ranged from  60 to 90 percent.  In the course of thcir review of  small-arms repair parts, DCSLOG person› nel  visited  fiOy-five  unit arms rooms and found that twelve stored small arms  parts.  In  none  of those  twelve  did  the  small-arms  parts  storage level  exceed the authorized level of repair.

Unit logistics  management  was  another  special  interest  item  Ihat DCSLOG personnel looked into as they visited various installations dur› ing the fiscal year. The revicwers sought  to determine the effectivencss of thc  unit 's  mai ntenance  and  repair  parts  supply  management  procedures and  to  evaluate  the  cffectiveness  of the  Unit  Level  Logistics  System (ULLS) in supporting maintenance, supply, and unit equipment dispatch› ing operations.  In  80  percent of the  units  visi ted.  reports  prepared  using the  Standard  Army  Maintenance  System- 2  computer  program  did  nOI agree  with  information  provided  by  other  standard  Army  management information systems. The primary reason for this deficiency was the lack of effective  and  standardized  policies  and  procedures.  More  than  two› thirds of the  installations visited  did  not  have  a standard  policy and  pro› cedure for these reporting requirements. Supply discipline was found also to be lacking in  the majority of the units visited; units were manipulating their  prescribed  load  li st stock  reports to ensure readiness by not running supply processes according to  the  ULLS manual.

Unit maintenance managers found the ULLS to be an effective man› agement  tool in managing  their  operations; however,  commanders, supervisors, and  operators cited  inadequate  training as  being the  weak link  in  using the ULLS effectively. Although ULLS operators and super› visors  received  on-the-job  trai ni ng,  there  was  little  use  of the  UlLS train ing  tutorial  because da ily system  requiremen ts  left  little or no  ti me for its use.  This  insuffi cient sustainment  training,  together  with  the inability 10  train new operators and a general  lack  or standa rdizcd oper› ating procedures rrom the Combat  Service  Support  Automation Management  Offices  down  to  the  end  uscr,  greatly  hindered  efficient usc of the  ULLS.

## Maintellollce

Integrated  Sustainment  Maintenance  (ISM)  is  an ODCSLOG  Imlla› live  that  integrales,  under  a  single  management  structure, all  active  and reserve  component general support maintenance units,  installation  logis› tics  faci lities,  maintenance depots, and defense contractors  who perform maintenance  on  wcapons  systems. ISM  streamlines  maintenance  and repair activities by centrally managing all  Army sustainment maintenance workloads. This integration of main lena  nee levels ensures the best  usc of maintenance skills and  reduces costs by eliminating  redundant  [ayers  of management and by increasing the Anny's sustaining base repair capabil› ity.  This,  in  turn, provides a focused  logistics effort  integral  to the Army's power-projection mission. A nine-month test  of the ISM  program, which ended  in 1994,  was  so  successful  that  the  Army  decided  to  begin  an expanded  demonSiration  of the  program  in  1995.  This  ongoing demon› stration evaluated procedures for expanding ISM  in MACOMs and estab› lished  the  roles and  functions of national-level  sllstainment management. It is expected  that  final  dctails  for  implementing  ISM  throughout  the Army will be prcsented to senior Army leaders for approval  in  1996.

In  FY  1995, the ODCSLOG's Logistics Integration Agency (LlA) began converting to a digital  format  the more  than  21,000 technical  manuals that exist for Army equipment. The new electronic technical manuals (ETM) will be distributcd on compact discs (CD) that soldiers will be able to use on any computer with Windows software and a CD reader. Digitization of  these pub› lications will  reduce the paper burden on soldiers in  the  field;  the  complete set  of technical  manuals (14,000  pages)  for  the  UI-I- 60  Black  Hawk  heli› copter, for example, has been digitized and placed on a single disk. The antic› ipatcd benefits  of  this initiative include li ghter  deployment loads and enhanced interactive troubleshooting and repair. TIle  ETMs will  replace the current  practice  of distributing  changcs  to  manuals  by  issuing  pages  for insertion in  loose-Ieafbinders with the practice of simply issuing an updated disk. This  will  reduce  the  cost  of distributing changes  and  ensure  that  the changes  reach  soldiers  quickly. Concurrently, LlA is developing  the Intcmctive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM), a software product that pro› vides better access to ETMs and automates the administmtive work mechan› ics currently perform manually. The mechanic can access technical manuals, order repair parts using a cut-and-paste  technique, and tmnsmit  information t o  the  ULLS by wireless or by disk.

Phase I of this  process  is  currently  under way;  L1A  is  converting those technical manuals used by the 4th Infantry  Division (Mechanized), Ihe 24th Infantry  Division  (Mechanized),  and  their respective corps supporting  ele› ments.  In addition  to  ETMs,  Ll A wi ll  provide a variety of cOlllmercial ofT› the-shelf hardware (notebook computers and servcrs) to evaluate  how well

commercial  hardware  supports units  in  a  taclical  environment.  Phase  II  of this  transformation  will  complete  the  process  of digillzation  of technical manuals and issue ETMs Army-wide. During Phase II, LIA will  publish and implement the Amly ITEM Strategic Plan.  Phase III  will  incorporate ITEMs developed  for sevcrnllypcs of supplies (such as fuel  and ammunition), cre› ate " families" of  common IETMs (such as internal combustion engines), and continue the testing and evaluation of  off-the-shelf technologies.

## SlIstaillabilily

In  FY 1994, units  and  inSlaliations  in  CONUS  began  to  convert  from JP-4 fuel  to the safer 1P- 8  fuel,  a conversion  that  already  was  largely com› pleled  outside  CONUS.  This  conversion,  mandated by DOD  Directive 4140.25, will  ease the Anny's logistical burden  by providing a single fuel  for aircraft, ground  vehicles, and  almost all  olher pieces of  equipment  that  use either a diesel engine or  an engine designed for JP- 8. The conversion program continued during  FY  1995  and  will  run  through  FY  1996.  Equipment  that uses motor gasoline, such as some generators and kitchen bumcrs, cannot be converted  to  JP-8 and  will  conti nue  to  be  used  unti l JP-8 burning  replace› ments  can be fielded. Elimination  of motor  gasoline- powered  equipment from  the inventory is not expected until  some time early in  the next century.

## Security Assistance

Security assistance is an important element  in  national security.  Army security assistance is pilrt of the larger DOD security assistance program. This program  expands  U.S.  innuence,  increases access to  key  locations, creates a cl imate of  trust and stability,  modernizes and standardizes equip› ment alllong allies, and assists developing countries  to  upgrade and pro› fessionalize  their  grou nd  forces.  The Army conducts  security  assistance through  the  DOD's  Foreign  Military  Sales  progralll  and international Military  Education and Training (IMET) program. The  Foreign  Military Sales program  is  the government-to-government c1mnnel  for selling U.S. defense equipment  services and training. The (MET program is a low-cost grant  program that  provides professional  military cducation and training to  foreign  military and civilian personnel.  By attending IMET-sponsored courses  and  programs  in the United  States,  future leaders  of  foreign defense and  related establishments are exposed  to  U.S.  values,  rcgard  for human rights, democratic institutions, and the role ofa professional mili› tary under civilian control.

On 2 March  1995, the  Secretary of the Army transferred  policy over› sight  of the  security  assistance  program  from  the  Assistant  Secretary  of the  Army  (Financial Management  and  Comptroller)  to  the  Assistant

Secretary of the Army (Installations,  Logistics,  and Environment).  Other more specific  responsibilities  pertaining  to  security  assistance  were  not changed. The ODCSLOG remained  Ihe Army  StafT focal point  for  man› aging security assistance requirements.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

Research, development, and acquisition arc critical 10  Ihe  support of Army modernization programs. The Army's weapons systems moderniza› tion  strategy  continued  1 0  be  guided  by  a  post- Cold  War  environment defined  by  new  global challenges  and riscal  constraints. The  service adhered  to a strategy of buying a  limited number of new weapons whi le extending  the  lives  and  improving  the  capabilities  of existing  systems. Table  10 shows budgct figures for Army research, development, and test› ing. Table  II shows budget  fi gures  for Army acquisition.

The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). a major subordinate com› mand of AMC, conducts basic and applied scientific research  for the ser› vice.  During FY  1995, ARL developed the Federated  Laboratory (FcdLab) concept, a  fundamental change in  how it conducts research.  In  response to lessons learned from the  Persian GlilfWar. the Chief ofSlatT, Anny, direct› ed AMC to develop the digilallechnoiogy required to transform the service into an  information-agc Army,  and  AMC directed ARL to develop the sci› entific  underpinnings of this  technology.  Faced  with a  major new mission and  declining  resources  created by the  post- Cold  War  drawdown,  ARL developed the concept of  "federating"  with private seclor organizations who had  the expertise to  accomplish the required tasks. Another reason  for fed~ erating is that the fields of  microelectronics and digital communications are advancing at  such  a  rale  thai  it  would  be  impossible  for ARL  to  establish itself as a center of excellence in these  fields.

The tool  for  creating  Fed Lab  is  the  "cooperative  agreemen t,"  a  new authority granted to DOD under 10 United Stales Code 2358. Cooperative agreements wi ll  let ARL and private organizations form close partnershi ps where  research  programs can be jointly planned, executed, and assessed. ARL will be able to do as much work as appropriate in~house, while l ead~ ing  an  integrated  program  in  which  ARL  personnel  work  with  leading researchcrs from industry and academia. This arrangement  allows ARL to maintain its technical expertise  in  microelectronics and digital communi~ cations so it  will  have  the  necessary  knowledge to  make  informed deci~ sions on development and acquisition  in  these  fields.  Coopcrative agrce~ menls will  be  used  10  form  a  consortium  in  each technology area identi~ fied  as nccessary to  support digitization.  Each consortium wi ll consist of at  least  one  industry  partner,  onc  rtl,tior research  university  partner,  and one  Historically  Black  College  or  University  or  Minority  Institution, which  would  receive  at  least  10  percent  of the  consortium's funding. Cooperative  agreements  are no~fee/no~profit arrangements;  the govern~ men! wi ll provide all  funding.

Implementation of FedLab began in  December 1994 with  the issuancc of  a  Broad Agency Announcement that described  the  Fed Lab concept and defined thc five technical areas in which consortia could compete: advanced distri buted  simulation,  telecommunications/information  distribution,  soO› ware and  intelligcnt  systems, advanced  intentctive displays,  and  advanced sensors. ARL would otTer five~year cooperative agreements to one consor~ tium in  each  of these  technical  areas,  with  a government  option  to  ex tend the relation for an additional three years. The winning consortia  from among the thi rty~seven proposals received will  be announccd in FY  1996.

During FY  1995, ARL achieved major breakthroughs in rcsearch that will  raise  the  accuracy  of "smart"  munitions  to  new  levels.  The  break› throughs include new computer algorithms to help missiles identify  very

slight differences in  targets, and miniature control mechanisms to maneu› ver  artillery  projectil es  toward  precise  map  coordinates  with  the  aid  of global  positioning  system (G PS) navigation  sensors. Another  ARL achievement was the development of a  miniature microwave transponder thaI uses  millimeter-wave  technology  to  identify  friendly  soldiers  and vehicles 011  the  battlefield. The  microwave  transponder  wi ll  give  battlc› fiel d commanders a highly portable identification device capable of pen› etrating smoke,  fog,  dust, and rain.

The DOD's A RPA and the U.S. Army Missile Command conducted a sliccessful joint  field  demonstrati on of the advanced  navigation  guidance system on a  fire support team vehicle (FISTY) in June  1995. For the tests, the  FISTY was equipped with ARPA's phase one GPS guidance package, known as the GG P.  The advanced navigation capabilities of the GG P pro› vided  the  FISTY  with  more  timely  azimuth  and  elevation  data  than  is available  with  current FISTY  equipment.  Target  engagemcnts  by  the GGI)-cquipped FI STY wcre completed seven  minutes faster than engage› ments  that  used current  FISTY equipment.  The  GGP also demonstrated greater  stability  in  mcasul'ement  accu racy  in  continuous  and  extcnded operation, more accurate geographic location of  the FISTY, more accurate azimuth and elevation  measurements,  and bctter target location accuracy. Finally, the GGP-equipped FISTY demonstrated that its ability to navigate was  more accuratc than  predecessor systems,  with  less  than  three meters error over a ten-kilometer course on Missile Command's test range.

To meet the requirement for secure military satellite communications, the  DOD  issued a  mission  needs  statement  for  Ihis  initiative  during  FY 1995.  The Army supported  this  DOD  initiative  through the  development of Ihe  secure  mobile  anti-jam  reliable  tact ical  terminal  (SMART-T)  and the  single-channel anti-jam  manportable  (SCAMP)  terminal,  which  arc designed to support units at and below corps level. The SMART-T is a new mobile multichannel satcllite terminal that extends the range capability of the  Army's  mobile  subscriber  equipment.  During  FY 1995  the  Army awarded  contracts  for  the  development  of six  SMART-T  prototypes  for developmental  testing. The SCAMP terminal  is a single-channel  terminal designed to interface  with  the Army's military strategic and tactical  relay system  and  to provide  point-Io-point  and broadcast  communications modes for critical command and control communications betwecn a head› quarters and its major subordinate elements. Two contracts were awarded in  FY  1995  for devclopmental testing of  SCAM P.

The Army continued  in  FY  1995 to  develop a single-channel,  ultra› high  frequency  (U HF)  tactical  satellite  terminal  called  the AN/PSC- 5 enhanced  manpack  UHF  terminal  (EMUT).  The  EMUT  modifies  the Army's existing  family of single-channel  radios  with  embedded encryp› ti on  and  provides better su pport of  organizations that  need a high level of

access  to  communications  satellites.  The  Army's  development of  the super-high-frequency  tri-band  advanced  range  extension  terminal  also conti nued  during FY  1995. This terminal gives  the Army's mobile COI11munications equipment an extended range capability for the area common user  system (ACUS) for  units  above  corps  level.  The  ACUS  is  an  area switched  communications  system  that  consists  of the  communications network  used  by  echelons  above  corps  level  and  the  mobile  subscriber equipment system used by units at and below corps level.  In  FY  1995, the Army  fielded  a  global  database  that  wi ll provide  adequate  warrighter communications  support  in  a  task  force  environment.  A eil'cuit switch routing improvement program to enhance the interoperabil ity between the various communications  systems  used  by  the  U.S.  military  services was also  implemented during the  fi scal year. The development of an  acquisi› tion  plan  to  modernize  the  ACUS  with  warfighter  information  network capabilities also began  in  FY  1995.

The  Army  decided  in  FY 1995  to  accelerate  the  procurement  of SINCGARS and to complete the fielding of the system by the end of FY 1998,  thcreby getting SINCGA RS  in  the  field sooner and saving  money ovcr the  long term.  SINCGA RS, which  replaces  the  VRC- 12  fa mily  of radios,  provides  Army  commanders  with  a  secure,  reliable,  and  easily maintained radio for command and control operations.  During  FY  1995, the  10th  Mountain  Division (Light), the Southern  European Task  Force, and  the  NTC  completed  the  transition  from  VRC- 12  series  radios  to SINCGARS. Fielding ofSINCGARS to U.S. Army,  Europe began in FY 1995 and is to continue through November  1996.

In  FY  1995, design  of the  cargo utility  GPS receiver was completed and  procurement action was  initiated. To help meet a congressional man› date  that  required  the  installation  of the  GPS on all  Army aircraft  by  FY 2000, Congress gave the Army an additional  $17.5 million for the project. Also established in  FY  1995 was the navigation warfare initiative, aimed at improving  protection  of encrypted  GPS  signals  from  enemy  interference and denying potential  adversaries access to  unencrypted GPS signals.

The  Battlefield  Communications  Review  (BCR)  program  is  a  Vice Chief of Staff, Army. program Ihal ensures that selected communications syslCllls are disbursed  properly throughout the Army. The BC R challenge is  to  avoid  interoperability  problems  as  the Army decreases  in  size and fields  new communications equipment by  managing  both  the  fielding of new equipment and the redistribution of equip  men  displaced by unit inac› I tivations with interopcrabi lity as a signi ficant consideration. Highlights of BCR  actions  during  FY  1995  included  preparing  to  field  mobile  sub› scriber equipment 10 the  133d Signal Battalion, Illinois Army ARNG, and overseeing the return of this equipment  to the  United  States  from  inacti› vating units in  Europe.

The  Information  Security  (INFOSEC)  program  continued  in FY 1995.  This  is  a  multiservice  project  that  provides  funding  for  research, development, testing,  evaluation,  procurement, and sustainment of com~ munic3tions  security  systems.  The  INFOSEC  program  also  provides  a secure Army·widc tactical, strategic, and sustaining base communications network  for  command  and  control,  electronic  warfare,  and  information systems.  Additionally,  I N FOSEC provides a security interface and  inter› operability  for  joint  communications  systems.  Development  began  of a device to protect  tactical  computer networks with end-to-end  encryption (the passing of information, by cryptographic means, from point  of  origin to  point of  desti nation). Conceptual development for a multilevel security system also began in  FY  1995.

During FY  1995,  Capability Package  One  of  the  Army Global Command  and  Control  System  (AGCCS)  was  developed  and  fielded  to support the transition from the existing Worldwide Military Command and Control  System. The AGCCS is thc Army's new command and control sys› tem  for  mobilization  and  war  planning,  readiness  reporting, and  deploy› ment  and  redeployment operations. The  AGCCS  is  designed  to  interface directly with both the Joint Global  Command and Control  System and the joint Operations Planning and Execution System. The infrastructure for the AGCCS,  which  includes telecommunications  lines and  multiplexers,  was installed, and database servers and computer terminals were  fielded  to  all MACOMs and Army supported communications sites.

The first preproduction command and  control vehicle  was completed in September 1995  and  shipped to the  Aberdecn Proving  Ground, Maryland, to undergo preproduction qualification testing by the Army. The command and control vchicle is a tracked armored vehicle that will  provide battlcstaffs  with  a  mobi le,  survivable,  and  reconfigurable  transportation platform capable of  hosting current and advanced command, control, com› munications, and intelligence systems for heavy-force operations.

The  XM8 Armored Gun System  is a direct-fire weapon  system  that wi ll  replace the M55 1  A I Sheridan Gun System and  provide large-caliber direct-fire support for light contingency forces and other light armor oper› ational  requirements.  During  FY  1995,  technical and  early  lIser  testing was conducted using six prototype vehicles delivered in  FY  1994. A deci› sion on  full  production of the XM8  is expected during FY  1997.

The AN/MPQ-64  Forward Area Air  Defense  Ground-Based  Sensor (FAAD GBS) will  provide division and corps air defense artillery battal› ions  with  an  early  warn ing  sensor against air attacks,  a  capability  these units  have  lacked  since  the  decision  in 1990  to  retire  the  forward  area alerti ng  radar  system  because  of that  system's low  efficiency  and  high operating costs. The  FAAD GBS uses an X-band phased array radar and is  highly  mobile.  The  Initial  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  of the  air

defense sensor was completed in  December  1994, and in  January  1995 a low-rate initial production contract  for ten  systems was awarded. The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) will  use the first  two of these systems in Task Force XXI.  In April  1995,  Ihe Army acquisition executive approved fu ll-rate  production, and  full-ralc  production del iveries  will  begin  in  FY 1997. The Army plans to purchase a lola I of 11 5 systems.

The  Advanced  Quickfix  (AQF)  is  an  upgrade  of the  Quickfix  hcli› borne  electronic  warfare  system.  The  AQF  will  provide  divisions  and armored cavalry regiments the capability 10  locate  precisely enemy radio and radar emissions and 10  render the enemy radio and radar systems inef› fective by electronic  attack.  In  FY  1995, the AQF  underwent operational testing. and  low·rate initial production is  scheduled to  begin  in  FY  1996.

As part of ils strategy of  extending  the  lives and  improving the capa› bilities of  ex isting systems, the Army in  FY  1994 decided to upgrade 998 MI  Abrams  tanks  to  the  MIA2  configuration.  The  M IA2's  reatures include a commander'S independent  thermal  viewer, improved navigation equipment, and a distributed data and power architecture. The digital data architecture.  which  integrates the  tank' s  electronic  components,  is a  sig› nifi ca nt  improvement, and makes the M  1  A2 the first fully integrated com› puter-driven  ground  combat  system. The  first  M lA2  was  delivered  on schedule  in  FY  1995,  and  the  ri rst unit  will  complete rieldi ng  and  train› ing on the M 1  A2  by early  FY  1996.

During  FY  1995,  the Army  began  to  retrofit  M2A2IM3A2  Bradley Fighting Vehicles with a laser range finder, GPS, driver's thermal viewer, and a  missile  countermeasure  device. These  improvcments  arc  based  on deficiencies noted during  DESERT  STORM,  and the  resulting configuration is  known  as  the  M2A20DS model of the  Bradley.  Also in  FY  1995, Ihe Army awarded a development contract for an upgrade of  the Bradley that builds upon  the  M2A20DS improvements. This  upgrade will  include an improved  target  acquisition  system,  a  forward-looking  infrared  system, and a  data  system  compatible  with the  those  in  the  M I  A2  Abrams  tank and the AI" I-64  Longbow Apache attack  helicopter.  Fielding of Bradleys with this upgrade  is expected to begin in  2001.

Work continued during FY  1995 on the Bradley Fire Support Vchicle (BFIST). The BFIST replaces the M 113-based M981 fire support vehicle, and will  be produced by converting existing infantry and cavalry Brad[eys to  the  Br[ST configuration. An  engineering and  manufacturing develop› ment contract  for  the  BF[ST was awarded in  mid- 1995, with completion scheduled for  1997. Full ~rate production is scheduled to begin in  [999.

The Grizzly breacher is a modified M I tank  chassis equipped  with a minc-clearing blade and a power~driven excavating arm. This system wilt be able to conduct full -width, clear~ lane breaches,  increasing the mobility of  armor and mechanized infantry units through mines, rubble, tank ditch-

es,  and  wire  obstacles. There  is  no  vehicle  in  the  Army  inventory  with these  capabilities.  The  contractor  delivered  two  prototypes  in  FY 1995; government testing of the prototypes will  begin  in  FY  1996.

The  Hercules  is  an  upgraded M88A I  recovery  vehicle,  with  an increased  power  train  and  improved  winching capabilities.  The  Hercules is designed to  be  able to  recover 011  ils  OWll  tracked  vehicles weighing up to  seventy  Ions, and  also  feat ures  an  armor applique  that  increases crew protection.  Currently,  two  M88A I  s  must  be  used  to  recover  an  Abrams tank.  A  low·rate  initial  production  contract  was  awarded  in  September 1994, and the first  fielding ofa Hercules to a uni t is planned for  FY  1 997.

In  June  1995,  the  27th  Main  Support  Battalion,  Fort  Hood,  Texas, became the  first  unit  to  field  the  Heavy  Equipment Transporter System (HETS). The primary mission oflhis system is to transport combat-loaded M I series tanks  and other vehicles of simi lar weights  on  highways, sec› ondary roads, and cross-country. The !-lETS consists of  the M I  070 tractor and  M  1000 semitrailer, can transport a seventy-ton payload, and  replaces the less-capable M911  tractor/M747 combination.  Fielding of HETS will continue through FY  1998.

## Support Services

Mora/e, W e!ftlre,  and Recreation

Through the Army Family Action  Plan (AFAP), the Army monitors and  improves  the  quality of life  for  active  duty soldiers,  reserve  corn› poncnt  soldiers,  soldiers' dependents,  Department  of the  Army  civil› ians, and retirees. This program operates at  installation, MACOMs, and HQDA  levels.  The  Army  hosts  a  worldwide  AFAP  conference  each October  in  Washington,  D.C. ,  where,  after  a  week  of working  group meetings, delegates present a  list o f key concerns 10  the  Chief of Siaff, Army, for his approval and subsequent action by the Army Siaff.  In  FY 1995,  MACOMs  submitted  131 issues  for  review  at  the  conference. Following a pattern similar to those of recent years, about one-fourth of these issues concerned  pay,  entitlements, or retiree benefits,  and about one-fiOh  dealt  with  soldier  education.  Of the  131 issues,  43  percent were classified as soldier isslles, 30 percent as family issues, 10 percent as reti ree issues, 8 percent as reserve components issues, and 5 percent as  civilian  employee  issues.  The  most  common  topics  wcre  separate rations,  ea re  for  the  elderly,  firs t-term  relocation  bencfits,  and  retiree medical  care

Conference  delegates  gave  twenty-six  issues  priority  as  key  con› cerns and elevated them to the Chief  of  Staff, Army, for his approval and th e  acti on  of the  Army  Staff.  The  delegates  voted  10  designate  as  their major concern  the dispensing of information about  Persian Gulf illness. The delegates listed the  followi ng as the  next most imporlant isslles  for the  1995 AFAP:  health  care  benefits  for  reti rees age 65  and  over,  death benefits for  reservists attendi ng  required  military education, dislocation allowances for  fi rst-term soldiers,  and  respite care for  fami lies of  those in  the  Exceptional Family Members program. Other issues were tmining for Youth Services personnel, management of  the Tuition Assistance pro› gram, medical care at  remole sites, and  protection of civilian employee retirement benefits.

The Army Family Team  Building (AFrB)  program began in  FY  1994 to educate soldiers, civilians, and families about life in the Army, and to help families  deal  with  problems  frequently  encountered  during  deployments. Soldiers and Department of  the Army civilian employees receive training on

the  AFTB  in  official  training  progmms.  Family  members  of active  and reserve  component  soldiers  and  civilian  employees  receive  this  training from  volunteer  family  members.  To  teach  the  AFTB  course,  the  Army Community and Family Support Center trains volunteers as master trainers. Once  trained,  these  master trainers  return  to  their  home  installations  and communil'ics  and Imin vol unteer instructors. In FY 1995,  the  Army Community and Family Support Center trained as master trainers  140 vol› unteers  from  overseas  Army  instal lations,  of  whom 60  were  from  Europe and 40 each from  Korea and Panama.  In the United Slales, 21 0 master train› ers were trained and an additional  1,700 vol unteers and staff personnel, pri› marily  from the USAR component, were trained as AFTB instructors.

The MWR Board of Directors is comprised of  six of  the Army's senior generals:  the commandcrs of u.s. Forces,  Korea;  FORSCOM; U.S. Army, Europe; TRADOC; AMC; and the  U.S. Army,  Pacific.  Meeting biennial› ly,  the  Board of  Directors is responsible for approving major management and fimmcial strategies, plans, and programs pertaining to the MWR pro› gram. The MWR Board of Directors also determines goals and objectives, and monitors implementation  plans  and  performance  measures.  The MWR Board of Directors supported four major initiatives during the fis› cal year.  First, the Board placed the cash held by installations in excess of requirements, which  is  defined as a  maximum cash  to  debt  ratio  of 2: I, into a  single,  departmcnt-wide account  in  accordance with  the  FY  1995 Defense  Authorization  Act.  Second,  the  Board  established  a  Capital Reinvestment Assessment  program  that  is  to  begin  in  FY  1996.  For  FY 1996, this assessment will be 2  percent of the installation's total revenue, followed  by  a  3  percent  increase every  year thereafter.  Thi rd,  the  Board revised the FY  1995 and FY  1996 MWR Financial Assessment Standards. Fourth,  the  Board endorsed the  purchase of the Shades of Green Armed Forces Recreation Center in Orlando, Florida.

The Youth  Partnership initiative,  an  MWR pilot  project, began  in  FY 1995.  This  project  uses  MWR  facili ties  as  satellite  sites  for  school-age programs  and  tcen  centers.  Examples  of the  Youth  Partnership  program include libraries supporting homework centers, bowling centers providing youth  instruction  and  competitions,  volunteers  working with  school-age children,  business  operations  sponsoring  youth  entrepreneur  initiatives, and  community  recreation  activities  sponsoring  special interest after› school  clubs.  Eleven  Army  installations  are  participating  in  the  initial implementation of the Youth  Partnership program.

A  three-year  interagency  agreement  between  the  CFSC  and  the Department  of Agriculture  will  enhance  after-school  activity  programs. Under this agreement, which will run from FY  1995 through FY 1997, the Department  of  Agriculture will provide staff training, program materials, and on-site technical assistance to the Army to significant ly increase af'ter-

school programs. Such programs include computer labs that wi ll  provide youths with opportunities to  develop computer literacy skills  for employ› ment; homework  centers  with  contracted  teachers and  tutoring services; workforce preparation programs thai increase youth awareness of  and pro› vide exposure to job and career opportunities, a supervised work environ› ment,  entrepreneurship,  and  the  interpersonal  skills  necessary  for  suc› cessful  employment;  and a pre-teen and teenage sponsorship program.

In  March  1993.  the  CFSC entered  into a  partnership  with  Fort  Sill, Oklahoma,  to test the economic  feasibility  of operating  arcade-Iype amusement  games in  MWR  activities. The  Fort  Sill  test  program  proved successful  and  the  CFSC  expanded  this  partnership  program  to  other install ations in  FY  1995.  By  the end of  the  fiscal  year, CFSC had formed partnerships with 7 Army installations in the United States, 4 in  Germany, and  5  in  Korea.  In  addition  to  these  partnerships,  an  alliance  with  the Army  and  Air Force Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  was formed in September 1995 to allow the CFSC to operate amusement games at sclect› ed AAFES  locations  in  the  United Slates  and  overseas. The  partnership program between the  CFSC and the various Army  installations  increases revenue-making potential by expanding the amusement game program to locations where operation solely  through MWR would  be infeasible. The alliance wilh AAFES allows the amusement game program to provide top› of-the-line games and services to installations that otherwise could not be supported. AI the  close of FY  1995,  the combined gross revenue  earned from  the amusement games totaled $ 1,940,727. Oflhal amount, $964,753 was sharcd proportionately by the participating inslallations.

In April 1995, the  Army Recrealion Machine  Program  (A RM?) ceased  slot  machine  operations  in Panama  for  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps when the Marine Corps club there closed. The ARMP continues to provide slot machines for the Marine Corps MWR facil ities in Japan under a  1993 partnership  agreement.  Gross  revenue  from  these  machines  in  FY  1995 totaled $ 14.8 mi ll ion; net  earnings for  the ARM ?  were $2 million.

The CFSC's Better Opporl'unities for Single Soldiers (BOSS) program continues to  address  the  needs of single  soldiers.  The  program  is  a  link between  single  soldiers  and  the  command,  and  allows  these  soldiers  10 address their quality-of-life concerns through the chain of  command. The program also assists single  soldiers  in  V Olunteering their time and  assis› tance for  community  service  through  activities  such  as  youth  sports leagues  and  the  Big  BrOlher- Big  Sister  program.  In  August  1995,  Fort Campbell,  Kentucky,  hosted  the  fifth Army-wide  BOSS training confer› ence. Attendees identified the top quality-of-life issues for single soldiers as  barracks  conditions  and  policies,  lack  of written guidance  to  govern BOSS programs, pay and entitlements, dining facility operation and poli› cies, and resources for education.

In March 1994,  the  MWR  Board  of  Directors  endorsed  plans  to reverse  losing  trends  in  club  operations  through  the  adoption  of brand› name food and beverage establishments. CFSC developed four initial food and  beverage  concepts:  Primo's  Italian  (pizza,  pasla,  and  subs);  Sam's Roadhouse  (steaks,  ribs,  and  chicken);  Reggie's (deli-style  sandwiches and specialty  burgers); and  Main  Street (regional American cuisine). The first  establishment, a  Primo's, opened at Fort  Hood, Texas,  in  June  1994. CFSC reviewed the brand-theme concepts and found a greater demand for quick service food and a need to standardize food nnd beverage operations in  golf  cou rse and bowling center snack  bars. The review led to  a revised line of  concepts:  Primo's Italian  Restaurant and a Primo's ex.press service; Reggie's  Brewing  Co.  (a  neighborhood  pub  atmosphere),  also  with  an express  service;  Sports  USA  (a  sports  bar);  Mulligan's (upgraded  golf course snack bar); and Strike Zone (for bowling center snack bars). CFSC, in  cooperation  wi th  MACOMs and installations, will  begin  to  implement thi s revised  line of brand-theme establishments in  FY  1996.

## Quality of  Life

In  November  1994,  the  Secretary of Defense established a  task  force under former Secretary of the Army John O.  Marsh, Jr.,  to review the qual› ity of  life of  military personnel, their fami lies, and DOD  civilians. Individuals  selected  for  the  Marsh  panel  were  experts  on  quali ty-of-life issues of  concern to the DOD. The panel held its first  meeting on 27 and 28 February  1995, at which time representatives from the OSD, the Joint Staff, and each military service identified key issues and concerns. The Army pre› sented hOllsing  for families and single soldiers as its primary quality-of-life concern.  In  FY  1995,  upkeep and  repair of more than 60 pereent of  Army family  housing  was  inadequate,  and  the  replacement  and  upgrade  eyele exceeded fitly-seven years. About 50 percent of  all Army barracks still had gang latrines and needed major repair. The cost to reduce the backlog of  bar› racks maintenance and repair was more than $7 billion spread ovcr a multi› year  DOD  spending program.  Based  largely  on  recommendations  by  thc Marsh panel, the Secretary of Defense added $2.7 billiollto the Future Years Defense Program  to  be distributed among the military services  to support quality-of-life  programs.  Of that  sum, $450 million  was  allocatcd  for  FY 1996; thc Army's  share of  this allocation was $2 11 .3 million. Of  that $211.3 million, $ 1  00 million is to go for thc maintenance and repair of  family hous› ing, $40 million for the maintcnance and repair of barracks, $35 million for Lhe  replacement and  upgradc of barracks, $14 million  for increasing Basic Allowance  for  Quarters  j&gt;&lt;'ymcnts , S II .2  million  for  recreation  programs, S10.7  million  to  expand  child  care operations,  and  $400,000 to  initiate  a new Cost of Living Allowance for CONUS high-cost areas.

## /-Ieallh  alld Medical

The  U.S.  Army  Medical  Research  Acquisition  Activity  completed  a comprehensive organizational restructuring during FY  1995. Major facets of the  new  organization  included  consolidating  acquisition  operations management  under one  Deputy  for Acquisition,  increasing emphasis on communication  methods and  marketing  capabilities,  and  improving  the policy and analysis funct ion. Additionally, stafT functions for the Principal Assistant  Responsible for Contracting were incorporated into the Medical Research Acquisition Activity to provide a more uni fied policy  voice.

Congress  appropriated  $5  million  in  the  FY 1995  budget  for  non› government  scientists to conduct research on the causes, transmission, and treatment  of Persian  Gulf War  veterans' illnesses. The  U.S.  Army  Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Fort Sam Houston, Texas, published solicitations for  research  proposals on epidemiological studies of Pcrsian Gulf War illnesses, on clinical  research and other studics of health consequences for soldiers serving in  the Persian Gulf, and to study the pos› sible effects  of exposure  to  N.N-diethyl-meta-toloanide  (DEET)  insect repellent,  permethrin  insecticide,  and  pyridostigmine  bromide  chemical agent  pretreatment tablets.  In  response to  suggestions that  combined expo› sure  to  DEET,  pennethrin, and  pyridostigmine  bromide  may  have  been a health  hazard  for  soldiers  duri ng  the  Persian  Gulf Win,  the  USAMRMC contracted with the U.S.  Army Center for Health  PromOl'ion and  Preventive Medicine for a toxicological study of  the three compounds. The study con› cluded that these substances might be more toxic when used in combination than when used separately. However, further research is needed to detennine whether  these  substances  are  among  the  causes  of  veterans'  illnesses. Soldiers  who  served  in  the  Persian  Gulf  were  exposed  to  much  smaller doses of  all  three chemicals than  wcre the  laboratory m lS lIsed in the study. The study also concluded that most servicc members were unlikely to  have been exposed to combinations of  the chemicals.

During FY 1995, represenl'atives from the U.S. Army  Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases joined an cleven-member team of sl&gt;cciaIists  from  the  US.  Centers  For  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  to investigate an outbreak of the  Ebola virus in Zaire. The  team investigated the cause of  the most recent outbreak, as well as the mechanism that main› tains the  Ebola virus  in  nature between outbreaks. The animal  host  for the virus  and  the  vector  for  its  transm ission  have  remained  mystcries  in  the twenty  years  that  medical  scientists  havc  studied  the  Ebola  virus  and  its periodic,  catastrophic outbreaks.  The  US.  Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases maintains research and medical expertise in highly  hazardous  inrectious diseases  because these  diseases  pose a  threat to the health of  US. mil itary personnel who could deploy to endemic areas.

In FY 1995, the U.S. Army  Research  Institute  of  Environmental Medicine  developed  Performance  PowcrThe  Nutrition  Connection,  a comprehensive sports nutrition  trai ning program designed  specifically  for the  military.  This  nutrition  program  is  designed  specifically  for  service members  who  are  moderately  to highly  physically  active,  either  from en forced trai ning  programs or personal endeavors.  The program  identifies the service member as an athlete and provides practical and easy-la-follow guidelines  on how  to  achieve  performance  benefits  through  nutrition. Potential participants  in  the  program  include  enlisted  recruits  or  basic trainees, students in  military courses and specialized schools of  instruction, patrons of on·post sports centers or gymnasiums,  ROTC  cadets, and  food service personnel and cooks attending Food Service Specialist Training.

## HOllsing

In FY 1995,  the  Army  continued  its Whole  Barracks  Renewal I)rogram and developed a  strategy  to implement a barracks upgrade pro· gram to further improve living conditions for single soldiers. The Chief  of Staff, Army, in  FY  1994 approved  this program, known as the " 1+ 1"  bar› racks standard. Two·room modules will  be constructed that wi ll  serve as a combined  living  room  and  bedroom. The  two  rooms,  each  occupied  by one soldier, will  be separated by a shared service arca and bathroom. Each module will have its own heating and air conditioning controls,  outlets for cable television and telephone, and a  bulk storage area separate from the module. The Army's strategy  for  implementing the  1+1 standard  is  three pronged.  New barracks built to the Sli:l11dard  will  replace old  gang·lalrine style barracks. Barracks built in  the  1970s will be upgraded through main· tenancc and  repair  projects  that  will  convert a  single three-soldier  room into two  one-soldier  rooms. As  additional barracks  arc built. the 1980s-era barracks oftwo·soldicr rooms will evcntual ly have just one sol› dicr assigned per rool11. The OSD is now reviewing the Army's  strategy for implementing the  1  I standard. +

TIle Army  family  housing  strategy  is  three  pronged.  First,  the  Army needs to  provide  more funds  for  family  housing  to  stop deterioration and replace and  upgrade its aging housing inventory.  Second, it  is  nccessary to gct rid  of unneeded and uneconomical housing. Third, Army  will  privatize its family housing program. In  FY  1994, the Chief  of  Staff, Army, approved the  fam ily  housing strategy for  further development. The Army Staff ana› lyzed  the  strategy  and  concluded  thai  the  Army  did  not  have  the  money either to upgrade 40,000 of lhe  120,000 fam ily houses it owned or to gCI rid of them and  pay  housing  allowances  to  an  additional 40,000  families. To achieve the Army's family  housing  vision, the Army  Staff decided  that  it would be necessary to privatize the family housing program.

With the decision to privatize made, the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Installation  Management in  FY  1995 developed the  Business Occupancy Program as the first step toward the  full  privatization of  Army family  hOllsi ng.  The  Business Occupancy Program  provides  money  10 Army  installations  in  amounts  based  on  their  housing occupancy  rates. Thus the  installations  have  an  incentive  to  increase  their  housing  occu› pancy rates to save the expense of  paying housing allowances and to save families from  out-of-pocket  expenses.  The  Army  tested  the  Business Occupancy Program at four installations during FY t 995, and the Chief of Staff,  Army, subsequently  approved  it for implementation  Army-wide beginning in FY  1996.

Concurrent with the Business Occupancy Program, the Army assisted the  OSD  in  the  development of FY  1 996  legislative authorities.  Capi",l Venture  Initiatives legislation asthat enabled the services to pursue family hOllsing  privatization  programs.  This  legislation  contained  in  the 1996 DOD  Military  Housing  Privatization  Initiatives  Act  gives  the  Army  the legal authority  to  seek private~sector assistance  in  funding,  constructing, managing,  and  maintaining  Army  family  housing.  This  authority  will allow the Army to replace and upgrade fam ily housing sooner than would be possible using appropriated funds.

After legislation was  approved, the Am1y  established  the Capital Venture Lnitiatives Program  to  initiate  public/private  partnerships  with developers.  The  Capital  Venture  Initiatives  and  the  Business  Occupancy Program, however, are not the  final  steps to  full  privatization  because they do not eliminate current statutory impediments to sound business practices. The Army also necds to change the way it  manages its housing program to ensure that the family~housing problem is resolved over the long terln.

## Army Safety Program

As part of the Force XXI initiative, the  Director of Army Safety initi· ated  the  Force  Protection  (Safety)  Functional  Area Asscssment  (FAA)  in FY  1995. Although the FAA  was to be subsumed initially under the  per· sonnel management  function,  the  Director of the Army Staff approved a request  from  the  Director of Army Safety to make it  part of the  redesign of the  leadership  function  of HQDA.  In  January  1 995,  the  Director  of Army Safety organized a core team composed of representatives from  the MACOMs, the  U.S.  Army Safety Center, and the Army Safety Offi ce 10 conduct the FAA.  In June  1995, the Director of  Army Safety approved the Force Protection (Safety) Campaign Plan, called Safe Force 2 1, with these goals:  redesign  the Army  safety program to  support  Force XX I; integrate safety  risk  management processes into Army operational  procedures and business  practices  and  provide coordinated  input  to  United  States  Code

Title  J  0  FAAs being conducted under Ihe Institutional Army Re·cnginecr· ing  and  Redesign  Campaign  Plan;  identify  safety-related  information requirements  in  support of Force  XX I; lmd  recognize options for  organi› zational  structure  and  alignment  of the  safety  function  .at installation, intermediate, and  I-IQDA  levels. The  FAA  identified  two safely  program core competencies: the integration of safety risk  management into prima› ry activities supporting Army missions, and prompt lmd sustained techni› cal safety services to commanders.

The vision of Safe Force 2 1 is  for the Anny Safety  Program to be the model  for  increasi ng  mission  effectiveness of systems, organiz..1tions,  and operations through  accident prevention in  peace and war. A primary objee· tive  of Safe  Force 21  is  to  ensure  that Army operations,  training,  materiel systems, and support systems arc designed to reflect the  requirements and operational  limitations of  soldiers as they perform  thei r missions.

In December 1994, the  U.S. Army Safety Center published Technical Report TR 95- 1, " Risk  Management for  Brigades and  Battalions," which delineated  procedures  and  responsibi lities  for  risk  managcment  during tra in ing  and  operations  that  pertained  to  clements  on  a  unit's  mission essential  task  li st.  The  procedures  and  responsibilities  contained  in  TR 95- 1 embody safety and the  avoidance of fratricide  as clements of force protection and are  integrated  into the traini ng program specified  in  Field Manual 25- 10 I, "Battle Focused Training." Testing with units that trained at the NTC,  the  Joint Readiness  Training  Center,  and the Combat Maneuver Training Center validated the provisions ofTR 95- 1.

The  Army  Safety  Ceiller  in  FY  1995  completed  development  of a "Small Unit  Leader's Force Protection Course," and began to offer it. This two·  week  ground·safety  training  program,  available  for  both  active  and reserve  component  personnel,  is  designed  for  captains,  lieutenants,  war· rant officers, and  NCOs. The course covers safety program  management, risk management techniques, tactical safety,  vehicle  accident  prevention, off-duty safety, and accident  reporting.

In  FY  1995,  the  number of ground  accidents  involving  fatalities,  per› sonal  injuries, or major property losses totaled 2,978, for a rate of  4.77 acci› dents per  1,000 soldiers, a decline from  the FY  1994 rate of 6.04. Accidents caused 210 soldier fatalities in FY  1995, including  11 6 deaths caused by pri› vatcly owned vehicle accidents. The aviation Class A flight accident rate for FY 1995 was 0.83 per 100,000 flying hours, a decline from the FY  1994 rate of 1.64.  A  Class A  flight  accident  is  defi ned as  an  accident  that  resu lts  in property damage of $1  mil1ion or in  a  fatality or pennanenl total dis.1bi lity. The Anny turned around the cost of  civilian federal  employee compensation claims  for  injury  and  illness  in  FY 1995  after several  years of continuous upward  movement. The cost of  Anny civilian  claims p&lt;1id  in  FY  1 995  was $164 million, down from $168 million in  FY  1994. The FY  1995 claims rate

for Anlly civilian occupational  injury and  illness was 24.55 per  1,000 civil· ian employees compared 10 an average of 25.24 for the previous three years.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The AAFES celebrated  ils  IOOth  anniversary  in July  1995.  Post and Base  Exchanges  conducted  sales events  in  July  and  hosted  anniversary ceremonies.  Continuing  its  tradition  of supporting  soldiers  engaged  in contingency and combat operations, AAFES provided in FY  1995 support to  mi litary personnel in  Hait i,  Kuwai t, and  Saudi Arabia.

Overall,  AAFES  sales  for  the  year  were  disappointing.  AI AAFES locations in  the  Pacific, sales growth conti nued because of 11  morc stable operating  environment  and  a  more  consistent  troop  strength  level. In Europe, AAFES sales  fell  because  of post- Cold  War  troop  withdrawals, but the cffcct was less severe than anticipated. In the Unitcd Statcs, a gen› erally  down  year  in  the  retaili ng  business  and  tough  competition  from commercial ret'lilers significantly affected AAFES sales.

AAFES continued its efforts to adapt to changes in  the retailing busi› ness  and  to  new  technologies.  As  part  of the  military's post- Cold  War downsizing,  AAFES  continued  to  reduce  both  its  salaried  and  hourly sta ffs.  These  reductions  wcre  accomplished  mainly  through  an  carly-out program. To improve effi ciency, AAFES now uses mcrchandise now sim› ulator computer software to identify  the most efficient logistical  pathway for the resupply of  its fac il ities. The  Retail  Point of  Sale II I program insta l› lation conti nued  in  FY  1995, and will be expanded during  FY  1996. The program uses wireless technology in  its registers, allows the processing of credit cards and checks at  registers, and provides item movement and cash and sales information to the host  computer system.

## Commalld In/ormation

The  most  significant  factor  that  affected  the  Office  of the  Chief of Public  Affairs  (OCrA)  in FY 1995  was  a  large  personnel  reduction. During FY  1995, OCPA's strength  was  cut by 40 authorizations:  1  I offi› cer  positions,  2 1 enlisted  positions,  and  eight  Department  of the  Army civilian  positions. By  function,  the  OCPA  lost  9  positions,  the  Army Broadcasting Service  cut  19  positions,  the  Command  Information  Unit lost  6  positions,  and  the Hometown  News  Service  deleted  1  position. Additionally, the OCPA branch office in New York was eliminated, result› ing  in  the  loss  of five positions.  That  office  was  later  reopened  and manned with three positions from the Command Information Unit.

The Los Angles Branch ofOCPA serves as the Army's liaison with the entertainment industry.  In FY  1995, the branch provided full  support to 3

Ihealricaimovics and  I cable television  movie, offered extensive courtesy assistance or project development to  7  movie  projects, and supported  26 television and video projects with  film  shorts or stock  footage.

## Army Sports Program

The Army  Sports  Program  provides  soldier-athletes  the  opportunity  to p..lrticipate  in  anned  forces,  national,  and  international  competitions.  AII› Army teams won eleven  of fifteen Armed  Forces Championships,  the  most successfu l year for a service's progrmll sirlce record keeping of  these st,lIistics began  in 1976. The first World Military Games were held in  September 1995 in  Italy. U.S. Army personnel comprised 46 percent or  the U.S. Armed Forces Delegation, and \von  71 percent of  the medals a\vardcd to the U.S.  team.

## Total Army Quality

The service  adopted Total  Army  Quality  (TAQ)  as  its  management philosophy in  1992. TAQ  is  an  integrated strategic management approach for achicving performance cxcellencc. This approach has, at  its core, four principles that  arc  the  foundation  for  significant and sustained  organiza› tional  improvement:  (I)  leadership  vision  and  commitment, (2)  mission and  customcr  focus,  (3)  employec  empowerment,  and  (4)  continuous improvement.  In  Fcbruary  1995, TRADOe assigned the  training  propo› ncncy for TAQ to the  U.S. Army Logistics Management College.

In  add ition to  the  projects summariz.ed  in Table 12, NAF MWR con› struction  projects yielded twenty-two new facilities valued at $56 million at  Army  installations  in  FY  1995.  There  were  another seventy-four COIl› stfuction  projects of this type  valued at  $389 million  in various  stages of programming, design, and construction during the year.

in FY  1995, the Army sold or transferred several real property assets that  were  no  longer  needed.  Cameron  Sial ion,  located  in  Alexandria, Virginia, was sold  for $33. 16 1 million. The sale was made after the city of Alexandria  completed  its  plan  for  the  property.  which  will  consist mostly of housing,  with  a  small  commercial  area.  The Army also  sold about  3,400  acres  of land  that  comprised  the  cantonment  area  for  the Jefferson Proving Ground in  Madison, Indiana, for $5.1  million. In addi· tion, the Army approved economic development conveyances for the fol· lowing installations: Lexi ngton Bluegrass  Army Depot, Kentucky; Sacramento  Army  Depot,  California; Tooele  Army  Depot,  Utah;  FOri Benjamin  Harrison,  Indiana;  and  Fort  Devens,  Massachusetts.  These conveyances transfer the Army's responsibilities for the care and custody of these  installations  to  the  local  communities and allow the  communi› ties  to  begin  the  redeve lopment process.

Provisions  of  the  PY 1995  military  construction  bill  required  the Army  to transfer, without  reimbursement,  the 580·acrc  Woodbridge Research Facility, located  in Woodbridge, Virginia,  to  the  Department of the Interior. The property will  be incorporated into the area's Mason Neck National  Wildli fe Refuge.  A  land  exchange  between  the  Army  and  Ihe Commonwealth  of Virginia  eliminated  boundary  discrepancies  on  the Pentagon  Reservation. The Army  leased  the  8-inch  Whittier-Anchorage Petroleum  Pipeline  to  the  Alaska  Pipeline  Company  for  transportation, maintenance,  and delivery of  nat ural gas to rural areas south of Anchorage,  Alaska,  and  from  Anchorage  to  Whittier,  Alaska. The  lease encompassed  only  the  pipeline.  The  Army  granted  a permit to the Department  of  Justice's  International  Criminal Investigative  Training Assistance Program to train  about 3,000 Haitian police personnel at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, during the  fiscal year, with the Army providing some logistical support  to the program.

Real ign ment  of the Army Aviation Technical Testing Center received Army approval during the  fiscal year. This realignment will  result  in  the termination  of the Army's aviation testing activities at Edwards Air Force Base,  California.  These activities  will  be  consolidated  with  the  aviation lechnicaltesting activities conducted at  Fort  Rucker, Alabama. and Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.

As the executive agent  for  the  DOD  for  all  military  recruiting  faci li› ti es, the Corps of Engineers continued to manage the Recruiting Facilities Program  throughout  FY  1995.  Responsibilities  include  budgeting,  pro·

gramming,  acquiring. disposing,  and  maintaining  the  space  required  by the military services for recruiting fac ilities and main recruiting stations.

## Legacy Program

The  DOD  Legacy  Resources  Management  Program,  an  FY 1991 Congressional  initiative,  was  another source of funding  for Army  envi› ronmental and cultural programs.  In  FY  1995, the Army  received $ 15.3 million  from  the  Legacy  PrognU11,  which it  distributed  among  J 18 envi› ronmental  projects. Additionally,  the  Legacy  Program  helped  fund sever› al  Army  cultural programs,  including  the Historic  Architect  Support Program  by the Seattle  (Washington) District, U.S. Army  Corps  of Engineers, which aids installations in preserving and maintaining historic buildings  and  structures owned  by  the  Army.  The  Legacy  Program also assisted  the St.  Louis (Missouri)  District,  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in conducting an inventory of cultural items in compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Rcp&lt;ltriation Act, which requires federal agcncies  to  notify  all  interested  tribes  lIpon any findings  of  Native American human  rcmains,  cultural  objects  of tri bal  importance, or any› thing  that  is  part  of an  individual's cultural  patrimony.  If  repatriation  is requested, the agency takes steps to accommodate the tribes' reburial rites and other ceremonial activities. The Army completed  fiOy  reports during the  fiscal year detai ling  its compl iance with the act.

## Special Functions

Civil Works

Funds appropriated  for  the  Corps of Engineers Civil  Works  program for FY  1995 totaled $3.33 billion, a decrease of about  17 percent from FY 1994. [n addition,  the  Corps  received  $35 million  from the  Coastal Wetlands  Restoration  Trust Fund for work in restoring wetlands  in Louisiana, and $230 million in  contributions from  non federal sponsors to defrdy  their shares of the  cost of projects under local  cooperation agree› ments in accordance with the Water Resources Development Act of \986. The 75  Corps-operated hydroelectric power plants generated 74.4 billion ki lowatt hours, returning $569 million to the  Department of  Treasury.

The Corps' Support  for  Others (SFO)  program assists other  federal , state, and local governmental agencies by providing engineering, environ· mental, construction  management, and other expertise they  need  but do not  have.  The  agencies  reimburse  the  Corps  for  these  services.  In  FY 1995,  the  SFO  program  completed  work  valued  at  $597  million.  The largest  percentage of  SFO effort was in environmental  work, and the sin· gle largest  user  of SFO  assistance  was  the  Environmental  Protection Agency's Superfund  program.  Some  difficulties  were  encountered  with the SFO program when  customer agencies did  not  receive  full  or timely appropriations  from  Congress;  the  Corps  cannot  begin  work  on  an  SFO program until  the customer agency pays.

During  FY  1995,  the  Corps  participated  in  several emergency  civi l works operations.  In January and March  1995, a series of storms inundat· ed  California and  led  to  all  of the  fifty·eight counties  in  the  state  being declared disaster areas. The Corps provided emergency contracting for the removal  of debris  from  bridge  structures,  conducted  emergency  levee repairs,  &lt;ll1d  provided  technical  advice.  After  Hurricane  Marilyn  hit  the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in September 1995, FEMA tasked the Corps  under  the  Federal  Response  Plan  with  more  than  $100  million worth  of mission  assignments  to  provide  water,  temporary  roofi ng  and housing rehabilitation, temporary power service, debris removal, technical assistance,  and storm  damage  documentation. This  work  continued  into FY  1996.  During FY  1995, the  Corps continued work  on a $230 million projcct  to repair the  20 I  levees damaged by the Midwest  Flood of 1993.

Floods again  hit  many of  these levees in  the spring of 1995; an  additional $40 to 60 mil lion will  be required to rcpair th is damage.

## Environmental Protection

The Office of the  Director of Environmental  Programs, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Instal lation  Management, rcorg&lt;ll1ized during FY 1995  into  three  divisions: Environmental  Quality;  Environmental Readiness;  and  Strategy,  Plans,  and  Programming.  This  reorganization will improve the  Army  Staff's  abi li ty  to  man&lt;lgc  the  service's environ· menial  program ofrCSloration, compliance, pollution prevention, and con· scrvalion.  The  FY  1995  environmental  operating  budget  was  $ 1.63  bil› lion, which included funds for the cleanup of  formerly  used defense sites and  for  the  BRAC environmental  program.  Additionally,  $ 1 million  was disbursed  to  Ihe  AMC to  begin  execution  of its  Executive  Order  12856 program. This executive order calls  for  a  review and revision of all  mili› tary specifications and  standards by  3 1 December  1999, with the objec› tive of reducing the amOllnt of hazardous materials used by thc Army.

In  FY  1995, the  landfill at FOri  Lewis, Washington,  became  the  first government  facility  to  be  removed  from  the  National  Priorities  List  for environmental  cleanup. This  landfi ll  was one of two Fori  Lewis  facilities 011 Ihe  list.  At the end of the  fi scal year, sites al thirty-three Army  instal› lat ions  sl'ill had facilities  on the li st. Also  in FY 1995,  the  Army's improved  compliance  with  federal  environmental  laws  and  regulations enabled it to reduce the amount of fines and pcnalties paid to $639,2 16, a decrease  of  more  than  90  percent  from FY 1994.  New  cnforcemcnt actions  taken  by  the Army decl ined  from 287  in  FY  1994 to  225  in  FY 1995, a 22 percent reduction. The majority of  assessed fines and penalties were  related to noncompliance  with  the  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery Act and the Clean Water Act.

In FY  1995, thc Army had more than  176 installations with recycling programs.  Many of thesc  installations  turned  thc  nct  proceeds  from  the sale  of recyclable  material over  to  MWR  activities. Through  the sale  of recyclable materials, the Army saved mi llions of  dollars in  waste disposal fees. For example, at  Fort Sill, Oklahoma,  4,7 16 Ions of refuse were recy› cled  in  FY  1995, resu lting in a sales income of$735,145 and a saving of $320,688 in  landfill costs.

While  thc  ARNG  continues  to  cmphasize cnvironmcntal  protection, funding shortfa lls continue to  ]jmit cfforts to  comply with environmcntal regulations.  To  improvc  opcrations  and  compliance,  the  Officc  of the Director,  ARNG,  published  a  comprehensive  Environmental  Training standard operating procedure in FY  1995. This operating procedure focus· es on  professional development  for  the  environmental staff,  training  for

futl-time  maintenance and  warehouse personnel, and  awareness training for  gua rdsmen.  Although  new  enforcement  actions  in  the  water quali ty program decreased frOIll  sixteen in  FY  1 994 to nine in  FY  1995, there was no decrease in the number of open enf orcement actions.  By the end of  FY 1995,  1,142  underground  storage  tanks  had  been  removed,  leaving  974 ta nks that  must  be  removed  or upgraded by  December  1998. An  aggres› sive  substitution  and  recycling  effort is  key  to  the  ARNG's strategy  to reduce toxic pollutants. During fY 1995, Pollution Prevention Opportunity Assessments were completed for every type of facility with› in  the ARNG and distributed to  the states.  By  the end of FY  1995, about 75  percent  of the  states  had  completed  Pollution  Prevention  Plans,  and thirty-eight states had enrolled  in  the  Environmental  Protection Agency's "Green Lights Program" and its energy conservation  program.

## Army  Energy Program

In  FY  1995, the Army continued  to manage its $67 mi llion  Facilities Energy Program.  Of that total, the program allocated $55  million  for  the accomplishment of  a  large number of Operation and  Maintcnance, Army, energy  projects.  The  remaining  $ 12  mi llion  was  allocated  for  Energy Conservation  Investment  Program  projects. Funding for two Army Self› Help efficiency  initiatives also  was  allocated  during  the  fiscal  year.  The Energy Conservation  Initiative  to  replace  steam  traps  and  repair energy distribution systems was funded at $ 10 million, and $26 mil lion was des› ignated  for the termination and buyout of  existing district heat contracts at Army installations being closed  in  Europe.

Army  facilit ies  reduced  their energy  use in  FY  1995  by  1.6  percent, based on  1,000 British thermal  units PCI' square foot , as compared with FY 1994, and  16  percent as compared  with the standard  established in  1985. This  reduction  represented  an  estimated saving  of $ 13  million  in  energy costs.  Ai r  pollution  emissions  also  were  reduced  in  FY 1995  from  FY 1994  levels by  2  million  tons of  carbon diox ide, 488,000 pounds of car› bon  monoxide,  132,000 pounds of hydrocarbons,  and  42,000  pounds  of nitrous oxide and sulfur oxide.

## Small alld Disadvantaged Business Utilization

Army  efforts  to  increase  the  partici pation  of  small businesses  and small  disadvantaged  businesses in Army contracts continued  throughout FY  1995.  Participation  in  the  Mentor-Protege  Program  also  continued during the fiscal  year. The program provides incentives for prime contrac› tors to assist small  and small disadvantaged businesses. The Army award› ed more than $3.65 million in  subcontracts during the fi scal year to  firms

participating  in  the  program.  The  Army  mel  or  exceeded  congressional goals  for  the  fourth  straight  year for  award ing  prime  contracts  and  sub› contracts to small  businesses and small disadvantaged businesses, and for contract  awards  to Historically Black  Colleges  and  Universities  and Minority  Institutions.  In  FY 1995,  the  Army awarded  the  DOD's largest single educational  contract  ever to a  historically black college  under the service's  Historically Black Colleges  and Universities  and Minority Institutions ini tiative.

The Corps of Engineers during the  fiscal year assigned  35.7 percent ($2.4 bil lion) of its contract obligations to small business firms under the Small  and  Disadvantaged  Business  Utilization  Program.  This  included 11.1  percent ($756 mill ion) of  contract obligations to small disadvan taged businesses.

## Legal Affairs

The Army conducted 1,482 courts-martial in  FY  1995, compared with the  1,569  reponed in  FY  1994, representi ng a decrease of 5.5 percent.  In FY  1995. the  number of general courts-martial decreased  by 2. 1 percent, bad  conduct  special  courts-martial  decreased  by  3.5  percent,  special courts-martial  decreased  by 3.7 percent,  and  summary  courts-martial decreased by  12.9  percent.  The overall conviction  rate  increased slightly from 91  percent  in  FY  1994 to 9 1.5  percent in  FY  1995. Table  13 outlines a comparison of  general, bad conduct special, special, and summary Army courts-martial for  FY  1995 and  FY  1994.

TABLE  I3-COMP ARISON 01' CoURTS-M ARTIAL FOR FY  1 995 AND FY  1994

The  Chief,  Criminal  Law  Division,  Office  of The  Judge  Advocate General (OT  JAG), served  as  the Army  representative to  the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice during FY  1995. The purpose of the com› mittee  is  to  propose and  evaluate  amendments  to  the Ulli/orm  Code  of MiJi/Gl y  Jus/ice and  the Mallual fa/"  COllr/s-Ma/"/ial, while  serving  as  a forum  for exchanging military justice information.

During FY 1995, the president issucd Executive Order 12960 announcing  the 1995  amendments  to  the Mal/llal  for  Courts-Martial.

These changes went  into effect on  10 June  1995.  Highlights of the  1995 amendments include enabling the sentencing authority,  upon  a  rehearing or new trial, to affirm the original sentence or reduce the sentence, but not to  increase  the sentence. The  1995  amendments also changed  the defini› tion of inherently dangerous acts to  cover acts dangerous 10 "another," as opposed  to  "others;" extended  the definition of drunken  or reckless  dri› ving to include the operation of  aircraft and vessels; and established a 0. 1  0 blood-alcohol  level  as  a per  sc standard for proof  of  intoxication. Additionally,  the  amendments  made rape gender neutral  and deleted  the marital  "defense" to rapc.

## Inspector General Activities

The mission of the Office of  The Inspector Gcneral  (OTIG) and thc U.S.  Army  Inspector General Agency  (USAIGA)  is  to  inquire  into  the state of  diseipline, efficieney, economy,  morale, training, and  readiness throughout  the Army. The  IG  staff in  FY  1995  handled a  total  of \ ,524 Inspector General  Action  Requests (IGAR),  plus 698 telephone hotline requests.  The  IGARs eonsisted  of 559  requests  for  assistanee and  965 allegations. Of the allegations,  153  (16 percent) were substantiated, 5 13 (53  pereent)  were  not  substantiated,  and 299 (3\  percent) could  be  nei› ther substantiated  nor refuted. The  IGARs  fell  into six  major functional categories. The first category,  personal conduct, includes sexual  harass› ment, racial  discrimination, and  nonsupport of family, among olhers. A tOlal  of  414 lGARs (27  percent)  fell  into  this category.  The second  cat› egory, command and (or) management of  organizations,  includes caring for soldiers and  family  members, storing and shipping of personal prop› erty, exercising command inOuence, and other related command or man› agement functions. There were 269 IGARs (18 percent) that fell  into this category.  The  third  category,  military  personnel  management,  ineludes recruiting  operations,  reassignments,  evaluation  reports,  promotions, personnel  separations,  awards  and  decorations,  and  similar  personnel functions.  A total  of 141  IGARs (9  percent)  fell  into  this category. The fourth  category,  civi lian  personnel management, ineludes management› employee relations, recruitment and placement, promotions, awards, and other related  fu ncti ons.  A  total  of 14 1 IGARs  (9  percent)  fell  into  this category.  The  fiOh  calegory,  commanders' actions  and  (or)  decisions, includes  soldier  details  and  duty  rosters,  the  weight  control  program, and mental evaluations. There were  II I IGARs (7 percellt) that  fell  into this category. The sixth category,  finance and accounting,  includes pay and allowances, finance services, and other related  functions. A total  of 101 IGARs (7 percent) fell  into this category.  Of all  the  IGARs handled by  the OTIG staff in  FY  1995,2 1 percent came from the active Army, 56

percent from  unknown sources,  18 percent from  civilians, and 5 percent from  the ARNG  and USA R.

The OTiG continued to conduct inspections and assessments across a broad  range  of force  readiness and  resource  management  issues in  train› ing, personnel,  supply, maintenance, installations, and acquisition throughout  FY  1995. The  IG also  remained responsive  to  other areas of concern  raised by the Army  Secretariat  and Army  Staff,  such as  soldier quality  of li fe  and  command  stewardshi p.  The  following  are  the  major inspections and assessments conducted  by  the OTIG (the dates in  paren› thesis indic&lt;l te the period of the inspection or assessment):  active compo› nenl trai ning (1993- 1995); high-intensity trai ning (1995); Army Retrograde of Equipment from Europe Maintenance Program ( 1 994-1995);  the  Contingency  Force  Pool,  the power~projection force rcady to  deploy  in  support  of Army divisions  in  the  event  of a  national emergency (1994-1995);  ROTC  and  U.S.  Military Academy cadet sum~ mer training assessment,  phase  I (Summer  1995); Reserve  mobilization for  Operation UPHOLD  DEMOCRACY  (October- November  1994);  a  fol› lowup to an FY 1994 assessment  of  the management of small~arms repair parts  (1995);  Army  acquisition  (May  1994-November  1995);  modeling and  si mulation  (1994-ongoing);  Category  I  missile  accountability  and securi ty  (May- Ju ne  1995);  technical  inspections (throughout FY 1995); Army  war  reserves  ( 1994-1995); organizational inspection program ( 1 994- 1995); and civilian  marksmanship program (1995).

In  addition  to  the IGARs,  the  OTiG  also  investigates  allegations against  general  officers,  Scnior  Executive  Service  civilian  employees, inspectors general, and other officials  in  high  positions.  In FY 1995, the OTIG conducted 22 formal  investigations and more than  116 preliminary inquiries. The most frequently investigated allegations were personal mis~ conduct, abuse of  authority,  misuse of funds, misuse ofpersonnei or prop~ erty, misuse of aircraft, and  sexual  harassment.

In  the  assessments  of Army  functions  under Title  10,  United  States Code,  initiated  during FY 1995  as  part  of the  Force  XX I  campaign's Insti tutional and Table of  Distribution and Allowances Army Redesign ini· tiat ive,  IG activities  were  included as a  function to  be assessed  under the Recruit and  Personnel Management FAA. The USAIGA began the assess› ment  in  early July  1995  by asking  IG  offices at  MACOMs for  workload and  other data  to  support the establishment of the  baseline  IG organiza~ tion. The  USA IGA  needed to identi fy  current Army  IG system processes and  the  resources  required  to  perform  those  processes.  A  preliminary analysis of the  information and  material  received  from  IG offices Army› wide determined that the basic inspector general processes of inspections, investigations, and  assistance are sound  and  efficient  and  meet  the needs of Army  leaders,  soldiers,  and  fami ly  members.  The  IG  FAA  was  still

under development at the end of FY  1995, however, to comply with con› ditions  outlined in the Institutional  and  Table  of  Distribution and Al lowances Army Redesign Campaign Plan.

## Army Marksmanship

TIle  U.S. Army  Marksmanship  Unit  (USAMU)  selects,  equips,  and tra ins  soldiers  to  participate  in  intcrscrvice.  national,  international,  and Olympic  marksmanship  competitions.  The  USAMU  also  promotes  the Army by publicizing the achievements and capabilities of its competitive shooters.  Lessons learned from the shooting competitions arc used by the Army to improve marksmanship Army-wide.

During FY 1995, the USAMU  hosted  inlcrservice  Championship Matches in  fOllr international disciplines:  pistol, riflc, shotgun, and running target.  Addi tionally, USAMU  shooters  participated  in  the  Service  Rifle Championship  held  at  Quantico  Marine  Corps  Base,  Virginia,  and  the Service Pistol Championship held at Camp Robinson, Arkansas.  T n March 1995,  twelve  USAMU shooters  participated  in  the  Pan American Games. During July and August 1995, the USAMU fielded small-bore, service ri fle, and service pistol teams to compete in  the National Matches held at Camp Perry, Ohio. In all, USAMU shooters (J&lt;1.rticipatcd in  220 separate competi› tions in twenty-seven states and foreign countries. Individuals in the unit set 4  international,  15  national, and 3 interservicc records. The USAMU com› petitors also won 2 world cups; 6  Pan American Games championships; 20 national championships;  1 2 interservice championships; and  a total of 702 medals, including 280 gold,  235 silver, and  187  bronze.

## The Army and Arms Control

Allhough  the Army  no  longer maintains a  nuclear weapons capabili› ty,  the service does playa major role in the nation's efforts to control these and other weapons of mass destruction. The Army provides policy analy› sis and  recommended  positions on  all Presidential Review  Directives on nonprol iferation, ballistic missile defense, chemical  and biological weapons arms control, and export controls. The Army supplies personnel to  serve  with  DOD's  On-Site  I nspection  Agency,  which  monitors  arms control treaty compliance. Because of  the threat posed by the proliferation of  weapons  of  mass destruction, ballistic missile technology, and advanced conventional weapons, the Anny will continue to play an impor› tant role in  these issues as a means of  enhancing national  security.

The  1986  National Defense  Authorization  Act  directed  DOD  to destroy  the  unitary  chemical  weapons stockpile, which is composed of a vari ety of nerve and blister agents stored in  bulk and as munitions at eight

sites  in  the  United  States and  one site on an  island  in  the  Pacific  Ocean. The  Army,  as  the  executive  agent  for  DOD,  developed  the  Chemical Stockpile  Disposal  Program  and a  plan  to destroy  the  agents and Illuni› tions on-site  in specially  designed  faci lities.  In  1992, Congress directed DOD to plan for the disposal of  chemical warfare materiel not included in the stockpile program. In response,  Ihe Army  established the Non› Stockpile  Chemical Matericl Program  to  dispose  of  this materiel. Concerned over increasing disposal costs and schedule slippage, changing legislat ive and regulatory requirements, and growing public concern about incineration as the  means for the dest ruction of chemical  weapons,  DOD in  December  1994  designated  the  Army's chemical  weapons  materiel demi litarization  program  as  a  major defense acquisition  program.  DOD intends  for  th is designation  to stabilize the disposal  schedule, better con› trol  costs,  and  provide a higher level of program oversight. This designa› tion  will  require the Army  to  develop a program cost  and schedule  base› line;  prepare  quarterly  defcnse  acquisition  executive  summaries,  which are intended to  provide an early warning that the baseline may be exceed› ed; and submit  an annual selected acquisition report to  Congress.

The Army during  FY  1995 continued  its chemical  weapons destruc› tion operations at Johnston Atoll  in the Pacific Ocean. The Army plans to construct eight other chemical  weapons destruction  faci lities  in CONUS at  thc  sites  where  chemical weapons  are stored. The  first of these  facili› tics, at Tooelc Army  Depot, Utah, was scheduled to begin  operations dur› ing  FY  1995.  Destruction opcrations arc now expected to begin at Tooele in FY  1996. This delay  is due 1 0 technical difficulties, management prob› lems, and  longer than anticipated negotiations with state regulatory agen› cies to  obtain  the  permits  required to  operate the  facil ity.  In  para llcl wit h the ongoing destruction program, the Army continues to research two neu› tra lizat ion-based altcrnatives  for destruction of  chemical  weapons stocks at  Aberdecn  Proving Ground,  Maryland,  and Newport Army Ammunition Plant,  Indiana.  Thc  Army  also  is  study ing  how  to  identify,  recover, and safely dispose of  nonstockpile chemical materiel such as buried munitions and production and test  facil ities.

## World Wa,. /I Commemoration

The  Secretary  of the  Army  was  the  executive  agent  for  the  DOD commemoration of  World War II. The DOD World War II Commemoration Committee planned,  integrated,  and  coordinated  pro› grams, ceremonies, and commemorative materials. The committee also developed educational and  support  materials,  public  service announce› ments,  lesson plans, and teachers' guides.  In  1995, the  committee com› memorated  landings  on  Luzon,  Iwo  Jima,  and  Okinawa;  operations  in

the  Ch ina-Burma-India Theater;  the  end  of the  war  in  Europe;  and  the end  of the  war  in  the  Pacific.  Through ils participation  in  these  and smaller  commemorative  events,  the  Army  honored  its  former  soldiers and comrades in the other services.

The U.S.  Army Center of Military  History supported the commemo› ration of  World War  II  in  a number of ways between  1990 and  1995. The Center wrote and  published  forty brochures concerning the World War II campaigns and special subjects; produced articles for official and unoffi› cial magazines; created special exhibits at the Smithsonian  Institution and the  Pentagon lIsing items  from  the  Army Art  Collection;  supported  the DOD World War 11 Commemoration Committee; answered inquiries from Congress, the press, and the public; and coordinated with official histori› ans from othcr nations on related World War II  issues.

## Conclusion

Fiscal  Year 1995  was  a  busy  and  challenging  year  for  the  Army. Although now at its smallest size since World War II, Ihe service participat› ed in numerous operational deployments, most  notably  in  Haiti and  in  the Persian Gulf. AI the same time, the Army continued the process of  reducing its  force  structure  and  insti tut ional  base  for  the  post- Cold  War  era.  The Army also  continued  to  work  on evolving  from  an  industrial-age,  threat› based, Cold War force to an  information-age, capabilities-based, power-pro› jection  force. The service sought to compensate for  its reduced strength by exploiting  new  information-age  technologies and  more  lethal  and  precise weapons systems. The Army's goal of fighting smarter and as a greater part ofajoint team underscorcd many orits initiatives such as Force XX I.

Facing  an  array  of commitments  proved  especially  challenging  as tight  fisca l  constraints  continued  a  downward  trcnd  that  began  in  FY 1986.  Army  leaders  had  to  consider  carefully  how  to  allocate  available runds among quali ty~o f~ lire, modernization programs, and  readiness. The service's smaller  size  and  increased  commitments  meant  that  soldiers deployed  with  increasing  frequency  and  that  their  deployments  lasted longer.  In  this  operational  cl imate,  quality  of life  issues grew  in i mpor~ tance,  and  the Army devoted significant attention and  resources to these isslles  because  they  play  an  im portan t  role  in  recrui ting  new  soldiers, retai ning trained personnel, sustaining morale, and supporting readiness.

To make more money avai lable  for rcadiness and quality-of-l ife  pro› grams, the Army fu nded only the most critical  modernization programs. For many weapons systems, the Army's strategy was  to extend  the  lives and  improve  the  performance of existing systems by  adding  new capa~ bilit ies  rather  than investing  in  new  syslems.  Looking  to  the  ruture, many  of the  most  important  Army  modernization  and  redesign i nitia~ lives  focused  on  how  Ihe  scrvice  would  look,  operate,  and  fight on  a twenty~firsl century battlefield.

By the end of FY  1995, the Anny was well on its way  in evolving inlo a  post-Cold War force.  During the  fiscal year,  readi ness,  moderni zation, quality-of-life  programs,  vehicle  and  equipment  maintenance,  and  real property  maintenance were all  affected adversely  as Army  leaders  made

dirTicult choices among these afeas  in  a climate of rcduced budgets, con· tinucd  downsizing,  and  increasingly  varied  obligations  and missions. Looking toward the future, the promise of  digilizalion and Force XX I pro› vided a  valuable  frame  of reference  for how  the Army of Ihe  post- Cold War era  would  modernize  and  appeal'  in  the  twenty-fi rst  century.  Force XXI also signaled  that  a  dramatic  break  in  how  the Army  operates as  a fighting  force  Illay  be on the  horizon.
