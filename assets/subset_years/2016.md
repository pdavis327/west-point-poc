## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2016

## 1 Introduction

The Army in fiscal year (FY) 2016 continued working toward a force with the characteristics described in The Army Vision: Strategic Advantage in a Complex World , published in FY 2015:

The Army of 2025 and Beyond will effectively employ lethal and non-lethal overmatch against any adversary to prevent, shape, and win conflicts and achieve national interests. It will leverage cross-cultural and regional experts to operate among populations, promote  regional  security,  and  be  interoperable  with  the  other Military Services, United States Government agencies and allied and  partner  nations.  Leveraging  the  Total  Force,  it  will  consist of  a  balanced,  versatile  mix  of  scalable,  expeditionary  forces that  can  rapidly  deploy  to  any  place  on  the  globe  and  conduct sustained operations within the full range of military operations. Composed  of  agile  and  innovative  institutions,  Soldiers,  and Civilians, the United States Army of 2025 and Beyond provides strategic advantage for the Nation with trusted professionals who strengthen the enduring bonds between the Army and the people it serves.

This  work  continued  within  an  organization  that  was  simultaneously transitioning  from  the  wars  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan,  operating continuously  around  the  world,  and  preparing  for  an  increasingly uncertain  and  complex  security  environment.  The  demand  from combatant commands for Army forces remained high, yet three years of reduced funding and the uncertainty created by the Budget Control Act  of  2011  left  the  service  with  insufficient  resources  in  money, personnel,  and  force  structure  to  fulfill  requirements  and  to  pursue long-term objectives with equal priority. Thus, FY 2016 continually presented senior leaders with decisions requiring trade-offs between the two.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

Organizational Changes

Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh resigned in November 2015.  That  same  month,  the  president  appointed  the  acting  Under Secretary of the Army Eric K. Fanning as the acting secretary and nominated him to be the next secretary of the Army. A senator then placed a hold on the nomination to protest the possible transfer of detainees  from  the  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba,  military  prison  to  the U.S.  Disciplinary  Barracks  at  Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas.  On  4

January 2016, Patrick J. Murphy was sworn in as under secretary of the Army. Later that month Murphy also became the acting secretary of the Army when Fanning stepped down in response to congressional criticisms  that  his  appointment  as  acting  secretary  circumvented the  nomination  process.  The  Senate  Committee  on  Armed  Services approved Fanning's nomination in March, but the senator would not lift his hold until May. On 18 May 2016, Fanning was sworn in as the twenty-second secretary of the Army.

Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army  (HQDA),  continued its transition to the fiscal year (FY) 2019 Organization Design. This transition was the culmination of a process that began in July 2013 when  the  Secretary  of  Defense  directed  a  20  percent  reduction  in headquarters management spending by the Department of Defense (DoD). To implement that decision, HQDA conducted a comprehensive review of its organization, including associated field operating agencies. In June 2015, Secretary McHugh approved the redesign recommended by the review, beginning with HQDA's provisional reorganization no later than the end of FY 2016, with full implementation of the plan no later than the beginning of FY 2019.

The review found that numerous HQDA agencies had an excessive number of echelons between action officers and senior decision makers, and  that  too  many  managers  had  too  few  employees  to  manage. Guidance for the redesign therefore included limiting organizational echelons to seven and setting the ideal manager-to-employee ratio at one to eight. By the start of FY 2016, the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, supported by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency and the affected organizations, had  revised  organizations'  tables  of  distribution  and  allowances  in accordance with the redesign. During FY 2016, the Army implemented these new tables and began the associated personnel reductions.

In November 2015, Acting Secretary of the Army Fanning directed a small team to explore the possibility of establishing an office for the streamlined acquisition of certain types of materiel. The team looked at offices with a similar mission in the DoD and private industry. The central elements that many of these organizations shared were a short, narrow chain of command; a small, motivated engineering and test team; autonomy; a central decision-making authority; and the ability to produce solutions that met many, but not all, requirements needed for a certain capability.

The result of this effort was the Army Rapid Capabilities Office, established in August 2016. It focuses on high-priority, threat-based projects  with  the  intent  of  delivering  an  operational  effect  within one  to  five  years.  It  combines  analysis,  prototyping,  development, procurement,  and  limited  fielding  functions  into  one  organization. The office provides expertise not just on materiel; its efforts encompass actions that also inform doctrine, organization, training, leadership, personnel, facilities, and policy aspects of implementing new capabilities. It leverages innovation by other government agencies and industry partners, as well as feedback from units. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office is distinct from the Army Rapid Equipping Force, which has a 180-day turnaround time and delivers specific equipment to meet the urgent operational needs of forward-deployed units. The Army Rapid Capabilities Office  reports  to  a  board  of  directors  led by the secretary of the Army and includes the chief of staff, Army (CSA), and the assistant secretary of the Army (acquisition, logistics, and technology). The service used personnel and resources from the System of Systems Engineering and Integration Directorate and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) to quickly establish the office.

Within  the  Army  staff,  the  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-3/5/7,  and the  deputy  chief  of  staff,  G-8,  share  the  responsibility  for  force development.  The  CSA  modified  this  partnership  in  FY  2016  by

increasing the authority of the Army  Requirements  Oversight Council (AROC) so that it can act as a hub for collaboration across requirements,  resourcing,  and  acquisition.  In  addition,  the  CSA transferred responsibility of the AROC process from the G-3/5/7 to the G-8. He also ordered the merger of G-3/5/7's Capabilities Integration Office with the G-8's Force Development Office.

A Department of the Army General Order designated the U.S. Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) as a direct reporting unit of the Office of the CSA in October 2015. This designation ended the practice of the assistant chief of staff for installation management (ACSIM) also serving as the commanding general of IMCOM. The split improved the efficiency of IMCOM headquarters, located at Fort Sam Houston,  Texas,  by  providing  a  full-time,  on-site  commander. It  also  initiated  a  realignment of the functional chief representative and the career management support positions for Career Program 29 (Installation Management) from IMCOM to ACSIM.

In  June  2016,  the  G-3/5/7  established  the  Army  Protection Directorate, responsible for all components of the Army Protection Program (APP). This directorate ensures unity of effort among HQDA principal  officials,  Army  commands,  and  other  Army  organizations for all Army protection-related programs and functions. The APP is the  overarching  management  program  for  thirteen  nonwarfighting functional elements: antiterrorism; cybersecurity; continuity of operations; critical infrastructure risk management; emergency management;  fire  and  emergency  services;  health  protection;  highrisk personnel; information assurance; law enforcement; operational security;  insider  threat  and  mitigation;  and  physical  security.  The directorate  manages  and  executes  the  Army  Critical  Infrastructure Risk Management Program, Army Emergency Management Program, and Army Insider Threat and Mitigation Program.

A Department of the Army General Order in July 2016 designated U.S.  Army  Cyber  Command  (ARCYBER)  as  the  Army  service component  command  of  U.S.  Cyber  Command.  This  designation brought ARCYBER's roles and authorities in-line with other Army service  component  commands.  As  the  Army  service  component command for cyberspace, ARCYBER directs and conducts operations to ensure freedom of action in this area. Preparations for the move of ARCYBER headquarters from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to Fort Gordon, Georgia,  announced  in  2013,  continued  during  FY  2016.  Ground breaking for the new facility at Fort Gordon is expected to occur in November 2016.

In  another  July  2016  action  taken  to  improve  the  Army's  cyber capabilities,  HQDA's  G-3/5/7  established  a  Cyber  Directorate.  The

directorate  serves  as  the  Army's  focal  point  for  cyber  requirements and policy development. It also serves as the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army and the CSA on cyber operations, information operations,  and  electronic  warfare.  There  are  five  divisions  in  the directorate:  strategy  and  policy;  mission  assurance;  resources  and requirements; operations and support; and plans and integration. Brig. Gen. Patricia A. Frost, deputy commanding general for operations at ARCYBER, was selected as the first head of the directorate.

During FY 2016, U.S. Army Medical Command and the Office of the Surgeon General continued the reorganization project begun in July 2015 to implement a more flexible and agile design for fully integrating all aspects of Army medicine from the strategic to the tactical levels. The  project  transformed  fifteen  regional  functional  commands  into four multidisciplinary regional health commands (RHC). The fourth of these new regional commands, RHC-Central, activated on 1 October 2015. RHC-Atlantic and RHC-Central are aligned with XVIII Corps and III Corps installations, respectively. RHC-Pacific is aligned with U.S. Army, Pacific, whereas RHC-Europe is aligned with U.S. Army, Europe, and U.S. Army, Africa. The project also eliminated Warrior Transition Command, which inactivated in June 2016. The mission of the command, which stood up in 2009, was to supervise the Army's care and transition program for wounded, ill, and injured soldiers. The command's headquarters staff became Medical Command's Deputy Chief of Staff for Warrior Care and Transition.

On 14 September 2016, ground was broken at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, for the National Museum of the United States Army (NMUSA). It will be the capstone of the service's museum system and provide the only comprehensive portrayal of Army history and traditions. The NMUSA Project Office, an element of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment) oversees the design and construction of the museum. Funding for the project comes from nongovernmental  sources  in  accordance  with  a  2009  memorandum of  agreement  which  designated  the  Army  Historical  Foundation  (a member-based, publicly supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization) as the official fund-raising entity for the project. The Army will operate and maintain the museum once it opens in 2019.

## Management

In April 2016, the acting secretary of the Army issued a directive on  financial  management  practices.  Effective  1  July  2016,  every two-star  and  Tier  2  Senior  Executive  Services  headquarters  and above, to include HQDA, must establish and track required annual

performance measures. These measures focus on achieving the highest level of readiness with the greatest efficiency. Officials were not to use budget  execution  data  and  obligation  rates  as  the  primary  measure of  fiscal  success.  Instead,  they  were  to  tie  resource  expenditures  to outcomes, and to identify the specific levels of readiness they expect to achieve given the resources provided. Total costs of critical processes, especially when funding was divided among multiple commands and sources, were to be identified and managed. Commanders and staffs would no longer automatically reduce future funding for commands or programs if they did not spend all of their current allocation; rather, the reasons for this result would be investigated to determine if it was a onetime event or if funding adjustments were needed.

The under secretary of the Army had oversight for implementation of the directive, whereas the inspector general and the Army auditor general  would  examine  these  areas  in  their  inspection  and  audit plans for FY 2017 and beyond. The assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and comptroller) and the director of business transformation were the proponents for this directive. They were to publish implementation guidance to include the process for identifying, reporting,  and  reviewing  performance  measures,  and  ensure  that the  provisions  of  this  directive  were  incorporated  into  appropriate regulations. The directive would be rescinded upon publication of the regulations.

In  June  2016,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  issued  a  directive on  divesting  the  service  of  obsolete  information  technology  (IT) hardware, software, and services. Elimination of the costs associated with operating and maintaining unnecessary legacy IT would increase resources  available  to  operate  a  modernized  network.  The  policy directed all senior IT leaders, typically the command G-6 or network enterprise center director, to review their networks to ensure that all commands completed the divestiture. Every quarter, commands had to validate and update IT investments and expenses in the Army Portfolio Management Solution (APMS), the Army's authoritative data source for IT. The Office of the Chief Information Officer/G-6 (CIO/G-6) at HQDA tracked the divestiture via APMS data trends.

The service targeted 140 data centers for closure during FY 2016 as  part  of  the  ongoing  Army  Data  Center  Consolidation  Program and in accordance with the 2010 Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative.  During  the  fiscal  year,  seventy-three  data  centers  closed. In August 2016, the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer promulgated a Data Center Optimization Initiative, superseding the older  initiative.  The  new  initiative  required  agencies  to  develop  and report on consolidation of inefficient infrastructure; optimization of

existing  facilities;  improvement  of  security  posture;  achievement  of cost savings; and the transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and interagency shared services. The new initiative and the failure to reach the FY 2016 closure target led to a reexamination of the Army Data Center Consolidation Program. The results of that review are expected to be implemented early in FY 2017 by a directive for a more aggressive program of closure and consolidation.

The  Army  completed  planning  for  the  Army  Private  Cloud Enterprise during the fiscal year. A contract prepared for a three-year pilot program at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, will be awarded early in FY 2017. Redstone is home to eleven data center facilities, which will be consolidated to host the contractor-built and operated pilot. The Army plans to certify this private cloud at the highest security levels available under DoD cloud security requirements guide, levels 5 and 6, which incorporate the necessary security controls to handle secret-level data. The Army plans to share lessons learned from the pilot program with the DoD and the other armed services.

In February 2016, the deputy secretary of defense directed that the military services and all defense agencies transition to the Microsoft Windows  10  computer  operating  system  by  31  January  2017.  The transition  was  necessary  to  strengthen  cybersecurity  and  streamline the  information  technology  operating  environment.  The  transition included  desktops,  laptops,  and  tablets,  but  not  Windows-based cell  phones  or  Microsoft  server  operating  systems.  In  FY  2016,  the Army  owned  approximately  1.3  million  end-point  devices  (defined as an Internet-capable computer hardware device) running Windows operating systems.

In March 2016, the Army's chief information officer stated that the  service  would  not  meet  the  transition  deadline.  The  Army  had many older systems running Windows 7 (or earlier) which ran highly customized applications. Transitioning these systems required detailed planning and preparation to ensure that the systems operated properly and  that  the  connectivity  between  them  would  not  be  broken.  The Army's CIO/G-6 established an 'early adopters' process in 2016 for testing, validating, and implementing Windows 10. It also developed a schedule for the transition, with devices in Europe migrating to the new system first, followed by those in the United States and Southwest Asia, and then those in the Pacific region. By the end of FY 2016, the CIO/G-6 expected the transition process in Europe to be completed by the middle of FY 2017.

The  Army  continued  working  with  the  Defense  Information Systems  Agency  (DISA)  on  implementation  of  the  Joint  Regional Security  Stacks  (JRSS)  concept  and  other  network  modernization

programs.  A  joint  regional  security  stack  is  a  suite  of  equipment that  performs  firewall  functions,  detects  and  prevents  intrusions, implements  enterprise  management,  executes  virtual  routing  and forwarding, and operates other network security capabilities. Security of  the  network  is  centralized  into  regional  architectures  instead  of locally distributed architectures at each post, camp, or station. Each physical stack is comprised of racks of equipment enabling big data analytics, and allowing the intake of large sets of data to the cloud. This equipment also provides the platforms for processing data, and the mechanism to help analysts use the data.

DISA  and  the  Army  G-6  planned  installation  of  Nonsecure Internet  Protocol  Router  JRSS  at  ten  sites  during  the  fiscal  year; DISA completed installation at seven continental United States sites, two sites  in  Europe,  and  one  site  in  Southwest  Asia.  They  planned installation of Secure Internet Protocol Router JRSS for eleven sites; DISA completed installation at four sites. They planned installation of  Multiprotocol  Label  Switching  at  thirty  sites;  DISA  completed installation at fourteen Defense Information Systems Network Subscription Services (DSS) sites and six non-DSS sites. Lastly, DISA and  the  Army  G-6  planned  fielding  of  Installation  Campus  Area Network at seventeen sites; DISA installed it at fourteen DSS sites and six non-DSS sites.

The  Enterprise  Content  Management  System  is  a  centralized library of more than 2,400 electronic forms and publications which supports  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1,  Human Resources  Command,  Army  Medical  Command,  and  the  Army Publishing Directorate (APD).  The  system  resided  on  obsolete hardware  and  software  and  its  decommissioning  is  scheduled  to occur  during  FY  2017.  Users  will  migrate  their  legacy  systems  to the Electronic Publications System (ePUBS). The APD transitioned to ePUBS in FY 2016. The adoption of ePUBS also eliminated the need  for  supporting  several  other  applications  and  saved  the  Office of Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army more than $20 million a year. In addition, the migration of the APD Web site from the Pentagon data center supported the vice director of the Army staff's initiative of increasing the Pentagon's cybersecurity posture.

In  October  2015,  the  Office  of  the  Provost  Marshal  General initiated a commercial, off-the-shelf procurement process for the Joint Analytic Real-Time Virtual Information Sharing System (JARVISS). The system will facilitate real-time sharing of threat information as incidents unfold, or during daily operations, among commands and installations.  In  September  2016,  the  under  secretary  of  the  Army established  JARVISS  as  a  defense  business  system  and  reassigned

it to  the  Warfighter  Mission  Area  within  the  Office  of  Business Transformation. The Army  Contracting Command-New  Jersey awarded the JARVISS contract on 30 September 2016.

The  General  Fund  Enterprise  Business  System  (GFEBS)  is  the Army's integrated financial management system for funds distribution, execution,  and  reporting,  as  well  as  for  real  property  management and maintenance. The system subsumed 107 older systems into one enterprisewide system. During FY 2016, the integration of GFEBS and the Global Combat Support System-Army continued. In August 2016, Phase 1B integrated the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard  military  personnel  accounts.  The  Army  National  Guard continues the transition of state adjutant general offices to GFEBS, with full implementation expected by April 2017.

Progress continued toward the goal of auditable financial statements by 30 September 2017. In FY 2016, the Army completed its second audit of the General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity (SBA). The scope of the audit included FY 2016 appropriation activity, as well as FY 2015 appropriation transactions. During the audit, an independent public accounting firm highlighted 100 findings that need corrective actions. The Army expects the FY 2017 SBA audit to show significant improvement because the majority of the corrective actions identified during the FY 2015 audit have been completed and some of the corrective actions resulting from the FY 2016 SBA audit findings will have been started.

Areas showing improvement during the FY 2016 audit include more consistent and higher quality documentation of supporting transactions, and increased response rate to missing documentation and follow-up questions.  Areas  with  continued  findings  include  inability  to  support beginning balances; inability to provide certain data populations and reconciliations; and  supporting  documentation  for  SBA  balances. Although,  the  Army  has  made  substantial  progress  toward  audit readiness,  significant  challenges  still  remain.  These  consist  of  the availability  of  personnel  and  resources;  the  improvement  of  internal controls; the documentation and correction of posting logic; and the reduction of the number and amount of unsupported adjustments.

The  service  completed  an  audit  of  selected  lines  in  the  Army Working Capital Fund financial statements. As part of the Working Capital Fund audit-readiness strategy, the audit supplemented other audit-readiness activities and validated corrective actions. Corrective actions have begun to address the findings associated with the limited financial statement audit. The audit found that sufficient supporting evidence was not available or was not provided; transactions were not recorded in the correct accounts and the amounts could not be verified;

transactions  were  recorded  in  different  periods  or  fiscal  years  than the action that generated the transaction; and updated depreciation methodology was not applied consistently to all assets.

The  Army  allocated  $87  million  during  FY  2016  for  achieving auditable financial statements. Funded activities included completing evaluation, discovery, and corrective actions of the commands and their service providers; testing or verifying audit readiness after completing corrective  actions  and  preparing  management  assertions;  building infrastructure  to  sustain  audit  readiness;  developing  and  deploying audit-ready  compliant  systems;  making  cost-effective  changes  to legacy systems; and converting and validating data, implementing and testing controls, and documenting systems and processes.

The  HQDA  CIO/G-6  revised  Army  Regulation  25-2, Army Cybersecurity . The  revision  assigns  responsibilities  and  prescribes policies  for  the  Army  Cybersecurity  Program  in  accordance  with Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  policies.  The  regulation also implements  elements  of  the APP  related  to cybersecurity risk  management.  The  revision  establishes  the  five  concurrent  and continuous functions for managing cybersecurity risk: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The draft and supporting Department of the Army pamphlets will enter the publication process in FY 2017.

To better align the service with the OSD policy on conferences issued in September 2015, Army Directive 2016-14 was published in May 2016. The directive lifted administrative burdens on low-cost participation in non-DoD conferences, while maintaining appropriate oversight of Army conference activities. In anticipation of revised guidance, issued in June 2016, the Army coordinated with OSD to ensure its next directive would be synchronized with that guidance. The Army Conference Management Office began consolidating the service's conference policies into an Army Regulation. Staffing for the draft regulation began in September 2016, with publication expected during FY 2017. The new regulation will take into  account  recommendations  from  the  Army  Audit  Agency's  2016 audit of compliance with the directive on conferences. During FY 2016, there were 33,688 Army attendees at 2,997 conferences at a total cost of $50.6 million.

## Budget

For the seventh consecutive year the Army began its fiscal year without  an  approved  budget,  operating  instead  on  a  congressional continuing resolution. The FY 2016 defense budget request submitted by the president had exceeded the caps placed on defense spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( Table 1 ). After avoiding a threatened

shutdown  of  the  federal  government,  Congress  finally  passed  a National Defense Authorization Act in October 2015. The president vetoed it on the grounds that although the bill contained some funding authorities,  the  DoD  needed  an  appropriations  bill  that  funded  the entire department. Furthermore, he argued that Congress had evaded the Budget Control Act of 2011 caps on the base budget by excessive use  of  overseas  operational  contingency  appropriations  ( Table  2 ). The bill also did not include provisions he had requested for making changes in areas such as health care and force structure.

Negotiations  within  Congress  and  between  Congress  and  the president  led  to  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  of  2015  in  November. The  law  raised  both  defense  and  nondefense  discretionary  budget caps by $25 billion in FY 2016 and $15 billion in FY 2017. It also

added overseas contingency operations funding at $16 billion above the president's FY 2016 request and set FY 2017 overseas contingency operations funding at $73.5 billion. The measure, however, provided the  DoD  with  $5  billion  less  than  the  president's  budget  request. With passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, the president ended his opposition to the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which became law with the $5 billion cut. As part of that cut, the Army lost approximately $450 million in readiness-related authorization funds$250 million from active duty accounts and $192.6 million from the National Guard ( Table 3 ).  The  act  did  permit  the  Army to shift $2 billion from its overseas contingency operations funding to the base budget ( Table 4 ).

All  three  military  personnel  appropriations  in  the  base  budget were fully executed by the end of FY 2016. The Army fully executed its  three  operation  and  maintenance  appropriations  in  the  base budget. The operations and maintenance appropriations for overseas contingency operations were fully executed notwithstanding turbulence  within  the  account.  The  president's  decision  to  extend the  9,800  troop  strength  level  in  Afghanistan,  which  resulted  in  a $1.4 billion shortfall in the account, created the turbulence. Working with  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (Comptroller),  the Army submitted a stand-alone reprogramming request and Congress approved  reprogramming  $1.4  billion  from  the  Defense  Working Capital Fund to offset this shortfall.

In  the  FY  2016/2018  procurement  appropriations,  a  total  of $13.8  billion  of  the  $18.5  billion  available  was  obligated.  Although this 75 percent obligation rate was below the 80 percent goal set by OSD in the first year of availability, it was still  an  improvement of 4  percent  over  the  preceding  year.  The  FY  2015/2017  procurement appropriations met the OSD obligation standard of 90 percent in the second year of availability. The Army implemented its expiring-year FY  2014  procurement  program  at  99.3  percent,  leaving  only  $107 million  unobligated.  An  Apache  helicopter  overseas  contingency operations award that was less than budgeted and missile procurement funds held to cover incentives associated with contract ceiling liabilities represented the unobligated funds.

Although  the  Army  did  not  meet  the  OSD  goal  of  55  percent, expenditure rate for its first year FY 2016 research, development, test and evaluation appropriation-disbursing $3.39 billion for a rate of 44.7 percent-it had a 3.7 percent improvement over last year. In expiring FY 2015 research, development, test, and evaluation appropriations, the service obligated 99.8 percent and disbursed 83.1 percent. The remaining funds were retained to finance contract adjustments.

In  military  construction  appropriations,  the  service  awarded ninety-four of 110 Regular Army projects. The remaining projects were  either  no  longer  required  because  of  operational  changes, or  had  environmental,  site,  or  solicitation  issues  which  postponed their award to FY 2017. In Army National Guard construction, the service  conferred  sixty-three  of  sixty-five  projects;  the  remaining two were postponed until FY 2017 because of environmental, site, redesign, and solicitation issues. In Army Reserve construction, the service  awarded  eighteen  of  twenty-three;  the  remaining  projects were postponed to FY 2017 or FY 2018 because of environmental, site, and solicitation issues. In family housing construction, the Army awarded eight of ten projects. One project was not required because of infrastructure consolidation in Europe, and design issues kept the other from being awarded.

The  Army  is  the  DoD's  executive  agent  for  recruiting  centers' security. Congress appropriated $80.3 million to upgrade security at joint recruiting centers after the 2015 shooting at a Chattanooga, Tennessee, recruiting station. The Corps of Engineers obligated all but $10 million of this funding. The remaining amount is on hold pending a resolution to a protest that a contractor filed at the end of the fiscal year.

In FY  2016, the above-threshold reprogramming  of funds (that  is,  an  amount  requiring  congressional  approval)  totaled  $3.84 billion,  a  41  percent  increase  from  FY  2015.  During  FY  2016,  the Army reprogrammed an additional  $2.86  billion  in  amounts  below the  statutory  limits  requiring  Congressional  approval.  The  service achieved a 98 percent approval rate in above-threshold reprogramming requests,  a  rate  noticeably  above  the  historical  average  of  80  to  90 percent. Notwithstanding efforts to reprogram earlier in the fiscal year, congressional schedules resulted in most reprogramming actions being approved during the last two months of the fiscal year, with an average processing time of 120 to 150 days for requests. Despite receiving most approvals late in FY 2016, the Army distributed these funds before the end of the fiscal year. There were significantly fewer appropriatedfund sources from which to reprogram funds than in prior years. The primary  reasons  for  this  decrease  were  reduced  funding  levels  and improved  management  and  execution  of  certain  accounts.  Primary reprogramming  sources  include  the  Army  Working  Capital  Fund, military personnel accounts, and the Defense Working Capital Fund.

The  Army  Working  Capital  Fund's  activities  provide  supplies, equipment, and ordnance to prepare, sustain, and reset forces in the most  efficient  and  cost-effective  manner  possible.  The  fund  ended FY  2016  with  a  cash  balance  of  $1.32  billion,  a  sum  within  the operating range set for the year. Carryover is the dollar amount of orders accepted from customers that have not been completed by the end of the fiscal year. The Army expects the carryover for FY 2016 to  be  less  than  the  maximum  allowable  amount.  Stock  availability measures the percentage of requisitions filled within established time frames. The goal for stock availability is 85 percent. For FY 2015, the average  stock  availability  was  84  percent  and  in  FY  2016  it  was  82 percent.

The  Bipartisan  Budget  Acts  of  2013  and  2015  have  delayed until FY 2018 the negative effects of the sequestration provisions in the  Budget Control Act of 2011. Though these acts provided more predictable funding from FY 2014 through FY 2017, it was less than the Army's FY 2013 sequestered funding and did not keep pace with inflation. These two-year delays were problematic in that they negatively affected midterm programming (that is, programming for the next two

to five years). The lack of predictable funding over a five-year period produces  inefficient  and  less  effective  use  of  resources.  The  Army needs consistent and predicable funding at a level commensurate with current and future requirements to sustain end strength and balance near-term readiness against modernization in order to meet current and future security challenges.

The  FY  2017  base budget request prioritizes readiness to conduct the full  range  of  military  operations,  with  an  emphasis  on building  capability  for  major  combat  operations  ( Table  5 ).  It  funds end  strengths  of  460,000  for  the  Regular  Army,  335,000  for  the Army National Guard, and 195,000 for the Army Reserve, as well as 197,392  full-time  equivalents  in  the  civilian  workforce.  The  request supports thirty brigade combat teams in the Regular Army, continues restoring unit readiness, and improves the service's ability to respond to potential threats in Europe by increasing the readiness and capacity of  pre-positioned  stocks.  The  request  for  research,  development, and acquisition continues to support science and technology programs,  aviation  modernization,  and  ground  combat  vehicle  fleet modernization,  while  deferring  new  investment  in  future  fighting vehicles, armed aerial scouts, and full on-the-move networking.

In  the  overseas  contingency  operations  request,  the  personnel funding primarily provides pay and allowances, subsistence, training, and administrative support for mobilized reserve component soldiers ( Table 6 ). The operations and maintenance funding supports Operation Freedom's senTinel in Afghanistan; Operation inherenT resolve against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; the European Reassurance Initiative; and Operation sparTan shield in the Arabian Gulf region. The research, development, and acquisition funding will provide replacement equipment for battle losses, replenish ammunition, and enhance pre-positioned equipment stocks in Europe.

By the end of FY 2016, Congress had not approved a budget for FY 2017. Instead, for the eighth consecutive time, the Army began a new fiscal year funded by a continuing resolution.

## Army Strength and Distribution

During fiscal year (FY) 2016, as a result of the end of Operation iraqi Freedom and Operation new dawn , and the ongoing drawdown of  U.S.  forces  in  Afghanistan,  the  Army  continued  along  a  course begun in FY 2011 to reach an end strength of 460,000 troops by the end of FY 2017. The active-component end strength on 30 September 2016 totaled 475,400 personnel: 77,561 commissioned officers, 14,568 warrant officers, 378,778 enlisted soldiers, and 4,493 military academy cadets. Women constituted 14.7 percent of the total active component and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 43.5 percent.

The Army National Guard end strength on 30 September 2016 was 341,589: 36,961 commissioned officers, 8,567 warrant officers, and 296,061 enlisted soldiers. Women constituted 17 percent of the Army National Guard and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 22 percent. The Army Reserve end strength on 30 September 2016 totaled 198,395 personnel: 33,938 commissioned officers, 3,409 warrant officers, and 161,048 enlisted soldiers. Women constituted 23 percent of the Army Reserve and racial and ethnic minorities constituted 47 percent.

## Officers

Human Resources Command (HRC) conducted three Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program panels during the fiscal year and selected 592  officers  to  transfer  to  understaffed  branches  and  functional areas. The FY 2016 Lieutenant Colonel Army Competitive Category Enhanced Selective Early Retirement Board chose 253 officers of the 924 considered for separation. The FY 2016 Chief Warrant Officer 5 Army Competitive Category Selective Retirement Board selected fiftyeight officers of the 185 considered.

## Enlisted Personnel

Despite a drop in the unemployment rate, the service achieved its FY 2016 objective of 62,500 recruits for the Regular Army. More than

95 percent of these recruits were high school graduates. The percentage of women enlisting was the highest in more than a decade, comprising 17.5 percent of recruits. Approximately 200 women chose infantry or armor occupational specialties. The Army National Guard achieved its  recruiting  objective of 36,800 for the first time in five years. The Army Reserve met its recruiting objective of 25,900.

Since  2008,  the  Army  has  required  master  sergeants  to  graduate from the Sergeants Major Course in order to be eligible for promotion to sergeant major. Effective 1 January 2016, the service expanded this concept  with  a  new  policy  called  Select,  Train,  Educate,  Promote. This  policy  requires  all  soldiers  to  complete  the  appropriate  level  of formal military education in order to be considered fully qualified for promotion. For the Regular Army and the Army Reserve, corporals and specialists must graduate from the Basic Leader Course for promotion to sergeant; sergeants must graduate from the Advance Leader Course for promotion to staff sergeant; and staff sergeants must graduate from the Senior Leader Course for promotion to sergeant first class. Soldiers who are not fully qualified will remain on the selection list with their sequence number, but will not be selected for promotion until after they are fully qualified and a new promotion requirement exists for their respective specialty and rank. Beginning with the FY 2016 promotion cycle, Army National Guard soldiers on a promotion list who have completed their structured self-development requirements will be selected and assigned to higher grade vacancies. Soldiers selected for higher grade vacancies who have not completed the appropriate course will have twenty-four months  to  complete  that  course  or  they  will  be  removed  from  the position. Soldiers who need to complete a course consisting of three or more phases will have a deadline of thirty-six months.

During FY 2016, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)  conducted  pilot  classes  of  the  Master  Leader  Course. This  course  will  fill  a  gap  in  the  noncommissioned  officer  (NCO) professional  development  system  between  the  Senior  Leader  Course and the Sergeant Major Course. It will prepare sergeants first class for the responsibilities of a master sergeant. Eventually, completion of the course  will  become  a  requirement  for  promotion  to  master  sergeant. TRADOC conducted the first pilot class at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major  Academy,  Fort  Bliss,  Texas.  The  National  Guard  Regional Training Institute at Camp Williams, Utah, and the Reserve Training Center at Fort Knox, Kentucky held the next two. The Sergeants Major Academy is conducting several initial operating courses to increase the number  of  qualified  instructors  and  to  validate  the  locations  where the course will be taught in preparation for full implementation of the program in FY 2017.

A  new  noncommissioned  officer  evaluation  report  went  into effect on 1 January 2016. The previous report, in use since 1987, had become highly inflated and was too generic. In order to curb rating inflation,  the  new  report  will  enforce  rating  official  accountability through the use of two new assessment tools: the rater tendency and the senior rater profile. Senior raters will be limited in the number of  soldiers  they  deem  'most  qualified.'  The  new  report  will  take into  account  increasing  levels  of  responsibility  by  having  three versions  tailored  to  a  soldier's  rank.  The  first,  for  sergeants,  will evaluate 'direct-level' proficiency. The second, for staff sergeants, sergeants first class, and master sergeants, will focus on the soldier's 'organizational-level' expertise. The third, for sergeants major, will assess 'strategic-level' competency.

## Civilian Personnel

At the end of the fiscal year, the Army civilian workforce totaled 294,640, including both appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund employees, working in nearly 500 different job series. Some civilians are foreign nationals who are directly funded by the U.S. Army; other foreign national employees are indirectly funded by their host nation ( Table 7 ).The FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act required the Department of Defense (DoD) to establish procedures for using performance as the primary factor for determining which employees should  be  separated  during  any  reduction  in  the  civilian  force.  The law also directed that DoD should proceed with 'New Beginnings,' the  DoD  Performance  Management  and  Appraisal  Program  and begin implementing the new system at the earliest possible date. The act extended the authority to grant Army civilians on official duty in

a combat zone the allowances, benefits, and gratuities comparable to those provided to members of the Foreign Service. It also provided enhanced hiring authorities for Army Cyber Command.

In December 2015, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff's G-1 began  work  on  expanding  the  Acculturation  Program  Army-wide. The program is meant to provide a positive socialization experience for  newly  hired  civilians  to  help  them  learn,  understand,  and  foster an appreciation for Army culture, and to reduce the amount of time it takes them to become effective and efficient employees. TRADOC fielded a pilot program in 2014. Transition of the program to G-1 is expected early in FY 2017 and Army-wide implementation is planned for August 2017.

## Integrating Women into Combat Arms Positions

In January 2013, the secretary of defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Ground  Combat  Definition  and  Assignment  Rule.  He  directed  the military services and U.S. Special Operations Command to validate all  occupational  standards  to  ensure  they  are  occupationally  and operationally relevant; to complete all studies by autumn 2015; and to either ensure full implementation by 1 January 2016 or submit an exception to policy to the secretary of defense. The Army responded to this directive with the Soldier 2020 program. The program examined institutional and cultural factors associated with gender integration. It also studied the physical demands in combat arms military occupational specialties (MOSs) to develop standards that would ensure that these positions are filled by soldiers who are physically qualified for them. These studies led to the opening of the 12B combat engineer and 13B and 13D artillery specialties, and the Ranger School, to women. On 30 September 2015, the Army recommended opening all MOSs that remained closed to women.

In December 2015, the secretary of defense directed the secretaries of the military departments to provide their plans on gender integration no later than 1 January 2016, detailing their timelines for integrating newly opened occupations and positions using their existing recruiting, accession, training, and assignment procedures. Positions were to be opened for accession as soon as practicable. In April 2016, the Army opened the remaining MOSs that had been closed to women in the infantry, armor, field artillery, and special forces branches.

The Army will use the 'leader first' approach: infantry and armor units will receive female officers and noncommissioned officers first so that female junior enlisted soldiers subsequently assigned to these units will  have  gender  integrated  leadership.  The  Army  successfully  integrated

twenty female infantry and twenty-four female armor officers during the year. In April 2016, the service revised reclassification options for Regular Army enlisted women in the rank of sergeant or below to allow their reclassification without a waiver of policy into fourteen previously closed combat specialties. The revision was necessary because many of these specialties do not meet the requirements for a standard primary MOS change as stipulated in the Reclassification In/Out Calls. Soldiers approved  for  reclassification  will  attend  the  necessary  training  in  a temporary  duty  status  en  route  to  a  follow-on  assignment  in  their new MOS. Four female drill sergeants were assigned to the Maneuver Center of Excellence, Fort Benning, Georgia, for initial-entry training of  female  recruits  in  infantry  and  armor  specialties.  By  the  end  of the fiscal year, approximately 140 women had enlisted for armor and infantry MOSs. Initial-entry training for armor recruits will begin in May 2017 and in June 2017 for infantry recruits.

## Special Topics

During the fiscal year, the president awarded the Medal of Honor to two retired soldiers: Lt. Col. Charles S. Kettles of the 176th Assault Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, for his actions as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam in 1967 and Capt. Florent A. Groberg of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, for his actions as an infantry officer in Afghanistan in 2012.

In August 2016, the Army established the Talent Management Task Force to integrate and synchronize efforts to acquire, develop, employ, and retain a high-quality force that can fight and win against any  adversary.  Following  creation  of  the  task  force,  the  Army developed  a  strategy  map  as  the  first  step  toward  transformation. The map lays out the ends, ways, and means necessary to optimize the talent of all personnel.

Work continued on the the Integrated Personnel and Pay SystemArmy  (IPPS-A).  This  system  is  designed  to  end  reliance  on  more than  forty  stovepipe  systems  (systems  that  do  not  efficiently  share information  with  one  another).  Once  implemented,  IPPS-A  will provide  a  centralized  resource  to  better  manage  personnel  and  pay information in the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve. The system will be fielded in five phases. The first phase was completed in 2015. The remaining phases will be fielded over the next five years.

The Army will use Assignment Interactive Module 2.0 (AIM 2) as  a  bridge  to  IPPS-A.  The  module  will  contain  soldiers'  job preferences,  background,  expertise,  and  military  and  civilian  skills in a single database. The HRC will begin an AIM 2 pilot effort in December 2016-officers attending the Command and General Staff College will receive their postgraduation assignments based on their data in AIM 2.

In January 2016, the secretary of defense directed a comprehensive review  of  all  Distinguished  Service  Cross,  Navy  Cross,  Air  Force Cross,  and  Silver  Star  Medal  recommendations  from  the  wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan. This review is to ensure service members had been  appropriately  recognized  for  their  valor.  The  review  examined recommendations  that  had  not  resulted  in  an  award  to  determine whether one was merited, and at medals awarded to determine whether the honors should be upgraded. Although there was no indication that members were inappropriately recognized, the secretary directed the review as a cautionary measure. Within the Army, HRC's Adjutant General  Division,  Awards  and  Decorations  Branch  is  reviewing  30 Distinguished Service Cross and 486 Silver Star packets for possible upgrade recommendation to a higher award. The review is scheduled to be completed by 30 September 2017.

The  Army's  uniform  and  appearance  regulation  prescribes  the standards by which soldiers dress and groom their hair. The regulation does not permit religious exceptions other than discreet jewelry and clothing  items  completely  covered  by  the  standard  uniform  and headgear.  During  FY  2016,  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army (Manpower  &amp;  Reserve  Affairs)  approved  over  twenty  requests  for religious accommodation requiring an exception to these standards. Approved requests included beards, turbans with unshorn hair, hijabs, and dreadlocks for soldiers from Sikh, Jewish, Muslim, and Rastafarian faiths. These requests, and potential involvement in litigation relating to  the  Religious  Freedom  Restoration  Act,  led  the  secretary  of  the Army to establish a working group in May 2016 to review religious accommodation  policies  and  procedures.  This  group  is  expected  to make its recommendations early in FY 2017.

The Soldier for Life program provides a broad network of resources to  shape  education,  employment,  and  health  policies,  programs, and services on behalf of soldiers, veterans, and family members. In FY 2016, it helped the Installation Management Command increase

the number of career skills programs offered from fifteen in FY 2014 to more than 156 in FY 2016, with a nearly 93 percent job-placement rate. The program also coordinated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring our Heroes Foundation to plan and execute transition summits, which  have  grown  from  six  in  FY  2014  to  over  thirty  in  FY  2016. Along with benefiting retiring and transitioning soldiers, the program provides a significant  budgetary  savings  as  well.  In  2011,  the  Army spent $515  million  on  unemployment  compensation  for  former soldiers; that amount dropped to $152 million during FY 2016.

In  2007,  the  Army  began  establishing  Warrior  Transition  Units to provide personalized support to wounded, ill, and injured soldiers who require  at  least  six  months  of  rehabilitative  care  and  complex medical management before either returning to duty or discharging from the service. As the number of soldiers in combat declined with the withdrawal from Iraq and the reduction of forces in Afghanistan, the number of soldiers needing to go through the Warrior Transition Units declined. Therefore, the Army reduced the number of Warrior Transition Units from a high of forty-five in 2008 to twenty-five in 2014. It inactivated another ten by August 2016: Fort Gordon, Georgia; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia; Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri;  Fort  Sill,  Oklahoma;  Fort  Polk,  Louisiana;  Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; Fort Meade, Maryland; and Naval Medical Center, California.

Warrior  Transition  Units  remain  in  thirteen  continental  U.S. locations: Joint Base  Lewis-McChord,  Washington;  Fort  Carson, Colorado; Fort Bliss, Texas; Joint Base San Antonio, Texas; Fort Hood, Texas;  Fort  Riley,  Kansas;  Fort  Campbell,  Kentucky;  Fort  Benning, Georgia;  Fort  Stewart,  Georgia;  Fort  Bragg,  North  Carolina;  Fort Belvoir,  Virginia;  Walter  Reed  Medical  Center,  Maryland;  and  Fort Drum, New York. The other two are at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii and European Medical Command in Kaiserslautern, Germany.

## Force Development

The  process  of  force  development  supports  Army  Campaign Plan  objectives  through  preparation  of  doctrine,  modernization  of equipment,  and  training  programs.  Two  major  issues  dominated this  effort  during  FY  2016.  The  first  was  restoring  capabilities  by improving training in certain areas that had been negatively affected by the cumulative effects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Second: force development needed to develop new equipment and doctrine to fulfill the Army's role as an integral part of the Joint Force.

Army  force  developers  encountered  two  significant  challenges during  FY  2016.  First,  the  Army  drawdown  in  personnel  strength continued to affect force structure and readiness. When the drawdown process began in January 2012, the service had made several decisions. At least ten Regular Army brigade combat teams (BCT) would be cut from the force structure. The remaining BCTs would be reorganized in  conjunction  with  this  smaller  force  structure.  By  30  September 2016, Regular Army personnel strength was the smallest it had been since  before  the  1940-1941  mobilization.  The  second  issue  was  the continuing financial uncertainty and the impact of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The financial  uncertainty  for  FY  2016  is  described  in Chapter  2.  The  implementation  of  sequestration  provisions  in  the Budget Control Act during FY 2013 created a significant long-term shortfall in Army funding.

The Department of Defense (DoD), in January 2012, established the Army's long-term force development priorities for FY 2016 with the issuance of Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for the 21st Century Defense . A major element of this guidance was a shift of U.S. interests and effort toward the Asia-Pacific region and a gradual reduction in the military strength of the service to 980,000: 450,000 in the Regular Army, 335,000 in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 in the Army Reserve. The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review provided further  direction  by  warning  of  a  sharp  increase  in  the  possibility of conflict with a peer competitor. In 2015, the Joint Chiefs of Staff released  an  updated  National  Military  Strategy  which  emphasized the threat posed by 'revisionist states,' particularly Russia. This new situation  was  reflected  in  the  Army  Posture  Statement  released  in March 2016.

One of the key ideas in the 2016 posture statement was the need to prepare for multidomain battle. The multidomain battle concept, heavily  influenced  by  studies  of  Russian  actions  in  the  Crimea  and Ukraine, emphasizes readiness for a broad spectrum of contingencies ranging from peacekeeping to conflict against a near-peer competitor occurring nearly simultaneously within a region. It is a change from the Army's focus on low-intensity conflict and counterinsurgency since 2001. That focus had left units poorly prepared for the fast pace and high lethality of combined arms combat.

The program objective memorandum (POM) released in June 2016 focused  on  improving  readiness  for  multidomain  operations  during 2018-2022 by increasing training intensity and lengthening training exercises. The Army National Guard received greater attention in the POM training plan,  with  a  doubling  of  the  Army  National  Guard combat training center rotations from two per year to four. The POM also increased reserve force mobilizations funded in the base budget by 100 percent.

In  the  Regular  Army,  the  most  important  planned  shift  was  the conversion of an infantry BCT to an armored BCT. This conversion would  meet  rotational  demands  from  Central  Command,  Pacific Command, and European Command. The POM called for building two Advise and Assist Brigades in the Regular Army and one in the Army National Guard. These units have only 500 personnel, with almost all being midgrade officers and noncommissioned officers trained to work with  allied,  partner,  and  coalition  units  for  security  force  assistance. In the event of a large-scale sustained conflict, these brigades can also provide the cadre for additional armor and infantry brigades.

## Training

At the start of FY 2016, the Army implemented changes to basic combat training as part of its transition from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  to  revitalizing  capabilities  for  high-intensity  combined arms  operations.  These  changes  increase  emphasis  on  Army  values and  discipline, renew  focus  on  physical  fitness,  and  revise  rifle marksmanship training.  Training  specific  to  operations  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan will be deleted, and some topics, such as interaction with news media, will be done in the soldier's first unit of assignment. A new addition to the course will be peer evaluations, similar to those used in the Ranger School. The primary purpose of peer evaluations is to assist in assessing a recruit's character.

Another  change  is  the  reestablishment  of  end-of-phase  testing. Previously, recruits had been tested on a skill immediately after it had

been taught to them, but this practice did not provide sufficient time for  the  repetitions  necessary  for  knowledge  retention.  Now  recruits will be evaluated at the end of each phase of the course on a selection of skills taught in that phase. Testing at the end of each phase grows more difficult. At the discretion of their commander, recruits failing an end-of-phase test can be recycled back to that part of the course. The final field training exercise will now include a final end-of-phase test and a timed road march, both of which the recruit will have to pass in order to graduate.

U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), in the first quarter of FY 2016, opened an online app store. The TRADOC Application  Gateway  allows  soldiers  to  download  unclassified  apps and interactive digital publications that are not considered 'for official use  only.'  In  addition  to  content  produced  by  TRADOC, the store will  permit others in the Army to request an app. For development of  these  applications,  the  TRADOC  capability  manager  for  mobile learning has a team of developers that can do in-house development for  Android,  iPhone,  and  Windows  phones.  Before  such  apps  can be posted, they must first be shown to be safe from malicious code. Then proponent organizations for the app must review it to ensure that  it  contains  accurate  and  up-to-date  information.  Organizations already independently hosting their own apps may transfer them to the TRADOC Application Gateway.

## Sustainable Readiness Model

In  FY  2016,  the  Army  continued  developing  the  Sustainable Readiness  Model.  Readiness  models  are  used  to  monitor  and  plan the  forces  that  can  be  made  available  for  operations  to  combatant commands. Sustainable readiness will replace Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN),  a  model  designed  primarily  to  generate  units  for predictable  deployments  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  The  Army  now, however, is expected to execute a multitude of highly diverse overseas missions, an operational tempo that could leave it without sufficient units ready for a war or other major contingencies.

Sustainable readiness extends the planning timeline by analyzing the Army's ability to meet global requirements four years into the future. This enables synchronizing resource decisions with the development of the POM. The previous ARFORGEN model considered a narrower scope of requirements and looked only two years in advance of the execution phase, making it almost impossible to capture key resource decisions  in  the  POM.  Sustainable  readiness  is  also  designed  to ensure that high-operational tempo units, such as civil affairs, combat

aviation,  and  military  intelligence,  are  tracked  in  a  more  detailed manner, compared to the BCT-centric model of ARFORGEN. Unlike ARFORGEN, there are no fixed, progressive cycles for Regular Army units, but reserve component units will remain on a five-year cycle.

Unlike  ARFORGEN's  three-stage  cycle  of  reset-train-deploy, sustainable readiness will be less mechanistic and create more detailed forecasts of unit readiness because it is measured against anticipated demands  on  a  quarterly  basis  through  the  first  two  years  of  each Future Year Defense Program. This analysis provides a method for synchronizing Army activities and resources by indicating whether a unit is preparing to assume a mission, ready for a mission, or already assigned a mission.

These readiness states provide the basis for the three descriptive, three-month  modules  (Prepare,  Ready,  and  Mission)  used  as  the organizing construct for the Sustainable Readiness Model. Within the 'Prepare' module, commanders will train their units to complete the full  range  of  military  operations.  Units  in  the  'Ready'  module  are prepared for deployment at any time. Units in the 'Mission' module are prepared for a variety of tasks, but focused to accomplish a specific mission. The Army will implement the Sustainable Readiness Model in FY 2017.

## Readiness Reporting

In FY 2015, Army senior leadership recognized the potential for tactical units to inflate training readiness ratings. The current T-rating criteria in the Unit Status Report (USR) is based on the commander's subjective assessment.  During  FY  2016,  the  G-3/5/7  developed the  concept  of  Objective-T  for  assessing  a  unit's  training  readiness. Objective-T consists of four measurable components that will form the overall training rating in the USR. These components are: individual, crew-served,  and  platform  weapon  qualifications;  collective  live-fire proficiency;  mission-essential  task  proficiency;  and  collective  days of  training  required  to  reach  the  highest  rating  of  T-1.  The  new concept has detailed descriptions of each component and establishes well-defined metrics for the weapons qualification, collective live-fire, and  required  training-day  evaluations.  The  commander's  ability  to subjectively upgrade a unit T-levels will be limited to no more than one grade.

The pilot program for Objective-T began in April 2016 with an armored brigade combat team at Fort Hood and it will be completed in January 2017. A second pilot program for aviation units will commence in  October  2016  with  a  combat  aviation  brigade  at  Fort  Campbell

and  will  end  in  September  2017.  Implementation  of  Objective-T  is scheduled for November 2017 for the Regular Army and January 2018 for the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard.

## Cyber

The development of a capable cyber force is critical to the Army's long term effort of building cyberspace capability. The service created cyber military occupational specialties for officers, noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel in the 17-series during 2015. During FY 2016, The U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency revised the  force  structure  documents  (modified  tables  of  organization  and equipment  and  tables  of  distribution  and  allowances)  to  reflect  all 17-series personnel authorizations.

The Army is building sixty-two Cyber Mission Force Teams. Of these, forty-one will be in the Regular Army, eleven will be in the Army National Guard, and ten will be in the Army Reserve. The first team achieved full operational capability in 2014 and the last is expected to reach that status in FY 2017. During FY 2016, U.S. Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) fielded teams designated as 'Cyber Support to Corps and Below' (CSCB) that integrate cyber effects at the tactical level. These teams work with units at the units' home station, at combat training centers, and on deployments.

In January 2016, a CSCB team partnered with a Stryker brigade combat  team  during  a  National  Training  Center  rotation.  As  part of  this  exercise,  the  team  created  a  realistic  cyber  environment  by replicating  a  real-world  network  provider  serving  the  several  mock villages in the training area, establishing Wi-Fi access points as well as providing laptops and smartphones to individuals portraying civilians and to opposing force units. A second CSCB team supported the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, during its rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center. This test cycle was supported by ARCYBER and its  subordinates:  the  U.S.  Army  Cyber  Protection Brigade, 1st Information Operations Command, and 780th Military Intelligence Brigade. The CSCB team incorporated more robust cyber effects into training scenarios, and trained the 3d Brigade on threats, tools,  tactics,  and  capabilities  at  the  home  station.  The  CSCB  was especially valuable during the planning phase by integrating cyberspace operations into targeting and augmenting the brigade staff.

In  August  another  National  Training  Center  rotation  involved a  CSCB team supporting the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division. As part of the exercise, a 'defensive support team' of four or five soldiers was assigned to protect the brigade network from attack,  whereas  four  cyber  electromagnetic  activity  weapons  teams conducted offensive operations against the opposing force's network. An electronic warfare section of two soldiers provided 'dismountable capability,' working against opposing forces' tactical eavesdropping, jamming, and hacking.

## Holistic Aviation Assessment Task Force

After a spike in Class A aviation accidents in the first quarter of FY 2016, the chief of staff, Army, established the Holistic Aviation Assessment  Task  Force  in  January  2016.  Its  mission  was  to  assess aviation  leadership,  readiness,  training,  maintenance,  sustainment, policy,  and  resources.  Thirty-four  experts  from  Army  Aviation  and the RAND Corporation, plus three senior consultants with extensive aviation  experience  comprised  the  task  force.  After  four  months  of research and analysis, the task force made sixty-three recommendations

The  recommendations  focused  on  regaining  core  competencies, ensuring total force employment, operating at best value, optimizing for the future fight, maximizing potential of unmanned aircraft systems, administering aviation soldier career management, and governing of the aviation enterprise. Recognizing the atrophied core competencies,

many  of the recommendations  emphasized the importance of 'flying  and  fixing'  as  it  relates  to  training.  This  in  turn  translates into  readiness  and  consequently  focuses  on  doctrine,  systems  and processes, and development of aviation professionals. Other proposals concentrated on the total cost of operations and improving the flyinghour program. Additionally, the program made recommendations to optimize  aviation  units'  ability  to  operate  against  any  threat,  under any conditions. Lastly, several recommendations called for significant investment in the enhancement of training and education of aviation soldiers. Complete implementation of the recommendations is expected by the end of 2018.

## Unit Rotations

In  FY 2016, the Army continued deploying units to Europe on a  rotational  basis  as  part  of  the  European  Reassurance  Initiative. This policy responded to increasing threats in that area and used unit rotation because current base funding does not support an increase in permanently assigned forces in Europe. Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), determined that the most effective course of action would be the deployment of an armored brigade combat team on a rotational basis. In addition to unit rotations, the initiative also included increased participation in exercises and expansion of Army pre-positioned stocks in this area.

The  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  3d  Infantry  Division,  from  Fort Stewart, Georgia, served as the rotational brigade from March 2015 to September 2016. During that period, it had two, three-month rotations and one, six-month rotation. While deployed, the brigade participated in multinational exercises across twelve European countries. The 3d Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, became the next rotational brigade. The brigade's equipment shipped overseas in November 2016 and the brigade's rotation commenced in January 2017.

## Force Structure

The  implementation  of  the  Budget  Control  Act's  sequestration provisions in 2013 made the Army's aviation structure unaffordable. In response, HQDA created the Aviation Restructure Initiative to retain as  many  of  its  most  capable  aircraft  as  possible.  The  initiative  also maximized capacity for  meeting  combatant  command  requirements by  placing  all  attack  helicopters  in  the  Regular  Army  and  focusing Army National Guard units on the lift and medevac missions. The secretary of defense approved the initiative in 2014. By the time it is

completed in FY 2019, the initiative will have eliminated nearly 700 aircraft and three combat aviation brigades from the Regular Army and 111 aircraft from the reserve components. All TH-67 initial pilot training helicopters will be retired. All OH-58A/C training and utility helicopters  will  be  retired.  All  OH-58D  reconnaissance  helicopters will  be  retired.  All  AH-64  attack  helicopters  in  the  Army  National Guard will be transferred to the Regular Army to replace the OH58Ds. Then one AH-64-equipped attack reconnaissance battalion in each Regular Army combat aviation brigade will convert to a heavy attack reconnaissance squadron design. This design will include RQ-7 Shadow  drones  for  the  capabilities  OH-58Ds  previously  provided. Additional  UH-60  helicopters  will  be  transferred  to  the  Army National  Guard  to  increase  the  number  of  medium  lift  units.  One hundred UH-72 helicopters will be procured for training missions.

By  the  end  of  FY  2016,  four  combat  aviation  brigades  had transitioned to the new design. All but one reconnaissance unit had divested their OH-58Ds; the remaining squadron will do so in FY 2017 after  the  end  of  its  Korean  rotation.  Forty-six  of  the  planned  fifty UH-60s had been transferred from the Regular Army to the Army National  Guard.  Seventy-two  AH-64Ds  had  been  transferred  from the  Army  National  Guard  to  the  Regular  Army;  eighty  AH-64Ds remained in Army National Guard units.

The National Commission on the Future of the Army released its final report on 28 January 2016. Congress established the commission in the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act in large part because of  two  concerns.  The  first  was  how  the  Army  should  best  organize and employ its three components in a time of declining resources. The second  was  whether  the  service  should  proceed  with  the  transfer  of AH-64 aircraft from the Army National Guard to the Regular Army, as directed by the Aviation Restructure Initiative. Congress directed the commission to undertake a comprehensive study of the structure of the service in order to assess the size and force mix of the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve, and make recommendations in those areas where the commission thought appropriate. In considering recommendations,  Congress  instructed  the  commission  to  take  into account anticipated mission requirements for the Army at acceptable levels of national risk and in a manner consistent with available and projected  resources.  Additionally,  Congress  specifically  directed  the commission to study the transfer of all the Army National Guard's AH-64 helicopters to the Regular Army.

The  commission  had  eight  members,  four  appointed  by  the president, and four by the chairs and ranking members of the Senate and  House  Armed  Services  Committees.  The  commissioners  were appointed as special  government employees for the duration of the commission's work. They selected a full-time executive director and a staff director who, in turn, selected a staff of about forty individuals, drawn from the Army Staff, the National Guard Bureau, and the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve, as well as the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the Congressional Research Service. The commission also  requested  assistance  from  the  Center  for  Strategic and International Studies, the Army War College, the Center for Army Analysis, the Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center, the Institute for Defense Analyses, and the RAND Corporation.

In its report, the commission made sixty-three recommendations. Concerning  the  National  Guard's  AH-64s,  it  proposed  a  plan  that would  distribute  the  fleet  among  twenty-four  battalions:  twenty  in the Regular Army, each equipped with twenty-four aircraft, and four in  the  Army National Guard, each equipped with eighteen aircraft. Furthermore, it advised that the Army should commit to using the four National Guard battalions regularly, mobilizing and deploying them in peacetime and war. In regards to the Total Force, the commission found  the  Army's  existing  initiatives  were  partially  meeting  the

concept's intent, but that more must be done to fully implement it. It recommended enactment of legislation allowing the assignment of Regular Army officers and enlisted soldiers to Army National Guard positions  without  prejudice  to  their  federal  standing.  It  suggested that  the  legislation  should  also  permit  the  similar  assignment  of National Guard officers and enlisted soldiers to Regular Army units. The commission suggested the number of annual rotations for Army National Guard brigade combat teams at combat training centers be increased beginning in FY 2017, without decreasing the number of Regular Army brigade combat team rotations.

Concerning  the  service  overall,  the  commission  advised  that Congress  should  maintain  future  Army  budgets  at  funding  levels at  least  equal  to  those  in  the  FY  2016  budget  request  because  of significant threats to national security. Its preferred course of action would be a service of at least 980,000 soldiers: 450,000 in the Regular Army,  335,000  in  the  Army  National  Guard,  and  195,000  in  the Army  Reserve.  The  commission  made  several  recommendations regarding force structure: an armored brigade combat team should be permanently stationed in Europe; a combat aviation brigade should be maintained in Korea; and eleven combat aviation brigades should be retained in the Regular Army. To counter the growing threat from Russia, it advocated for the Army to increase armored brigade combat team capacity, and the service should consider inactivating up to two Regular  Army  infantry  brigade  combat  teams  in  order  to  provide personnel spaces that could be used to address higher priority risks.

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had eroded the Army's capacity for combined arms battle against a peer competitor and the commission stressed the importance of rebuilding this capacity. It recommended that Congress require the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Army  to  provide,  within  a  year,  an  assessment  of  the  ways-and associated costs-of reducing or eliminating various shortfalls it had identified:

- · AH-64-equipped attack reconnaissance battalions
- · Short-range air defense meeting existing and emerging threats, to include unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles
- · Defense against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons
- · Field artillery, to include changes  in doctrine and  war plans  resulting  from  adherence  to  the  2008  DoD  policy restricting the use of cluster munitions, as well as required modernization and munition inventory shortfalls
- · Quartermaster fuel distribution and water purification
- · Army watercraft and port-opening capabilities

- · Transportation of fuel, water, and cargo
- · Military police.

After  completing  a  review  of  the  commission's  report,  HQDA supported,  in  principle,  the  vast  majority  of  its  recommendations. Some of the most significant ones endorsed include the stationing of an armored brigade combat team in Europe, retaining eleven combat aviation brigades, and increasing National Guard rotations at combat training centers. The difficulty for the service was that in many cases the commission did not identify the resources, in funding and personnel, necessary to implement a recommendation.

To demonstrate its acceptance of the commission's recommendations  and  its  commitment  to  resolving  internal  Army  friction,  the service prepared an unsolicited initial response to Congress on the commission's report. The acting secretary of the Army, the chief of staff, Army, the chief, National Guard Bureau, the chief, Army Reserve,  and  the  director  of  the  Army  National  Guard  signed  it  on 25 April 2016. They submitted the response to OSD for review and sending to Congress, but OSD elected to not forward the report until after its own assessment-part of the normally scheduled Program Budget  Review  in  the  fall  of  2016.  The  House  of  Representatives subsequently included language in House Report 114-537, requiring a report from the Army by 1 December 2016.

Initially,  the  Army  planned  to  deactivate  two  brigade  combat teams during FY 2016 in response to fiscal constraints: 3d Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, at Fort Benning, Georgia, and 4th  Brigade  Combat  Team,  25th  Infantry  Division,  at  Joint  Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. Each brigade would be replaced by an infantry battalion task force, a reduction in strength from about 4,000 soldiers to about 1,050 soldiers. In March 2016, however, the Army suspended the inactivation of the airborne brigade combat team in Alaska because of the threats from Russia and North Korea. The inactivation of the brigade combat team at Fort Benning continued as planned; the Army activated 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, there in December 2015 and assigned it to the 3d Infantry Division.

Armored  brigade  combat  teams  revised  their  structure.  Each maneuver  battalion  went  from  four  to  three  maneuver  companies. The brigade's cavalry squadron added a tank company to provide it increased lethality and survivability.

## Operational Forces

During fiscal year (FY) 2016, units of the Army were active in a variety of global operations and engaged in security assistance with multiple foreign partners. In FY 2016, the service sought to increase its strength in Europe, and continued a program to rotate combat units from the continental United States to Europe. At the end of the fiscal year 26,109 soldiers were stationed in Europe, with 20,611 in Germany. Italy had the second largest total with 4,442, mostly associated with the 173d Brigade Combat Team stationed in Vicenza. In Belgium, 565 personnel  supported  NATO  (North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization) headquarters and 171 were assigned in the United Kingdom. Additionally,  320  soldiers  were  stationed  in  Kosovo  in  support  of Kosovo Force peacekeeping operations.

In  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  2,717  soldiers  were  stationed  in Japan, either at Camp Zama outside of Tokyo or in Okinawa. Fortyfive soldiers were stationed in Thailand, helping to coordinate training exercises between the Thailand Armed Forces and the United States. There were 15,866 soldiers stationed in the Republic of Korea.

In the western hemisphere, 141 personnel were assigned to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 234 were stationed in Honduras, and 26 in Colombia. The majority of countries in the western hemisphere had very small numbers of Army personnel, usually less than three, assigned to embassy staff elements.

## Afghanistan

Operation Freedom's  senTinel in Afghanistan  continued  to require significant Army support during FY 2016. In September 2015, the number of personnel deployed to Afghanistan was 6,937 Regular Army, 743 mobilized Army National Guard, and 559 mobilized Army Reserve. By the end of September 2016, that number had decreased slightly to 6,846 Regular Army, 609 mobilized Army National Guard, and  677  mobilized  Army  Reserve.  Army  combat  casualties  for Operation Freedom's senTinel during FY 2016 were two killed and fifty-eight wounded.

American  forces  in  Afghanistan  have  two  missions:  counterterrorism  against  the  remnants  of  al-Qaeda  and  training,  assisting,

and advising mission-supporting Afghan security forces. The largest commitments during FY 2016 were elements of two division headquarters  and  two  brigade  combat  teams  augmented  to  function  as security-force-assistance brigades. In October 2015, the 10th Mountain Division and its 3d Brigade Combat Team assumed responsibility for  Train  Advise  Assist  Command-East  from  3d  Infantry  Division and 3d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. In June 2016, the 36th Infantry Division and 2d Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, assumed responsibility for Train Advise Assist CommandSouth from the 7th Infantry Division and 2d Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division.

## Iraq

Iraq faces lingering ethnic and sectarian mistrust, tensions between political parties, and strained governmental capacity to provide basic services.  The  most  direct  threat  to  Iraq  is  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Operation inherenT resolve began in June 2014, in conjunction with partner forces, to defeat ISIS in designated areas of Iraq and Syria and set conditions for follow-on operations to increase regional stability. During FY 2016, significant progress occurred in the fight against ISIS. Iraqi forces recaptured Fallujah on 26 June 2016, which  forced  ISIS  further  away  from  Baghdad  and  paved  the  way for the liberation of the Euphrates river valley. On 25 August 2016, Iraqi forces seized the airfield at Qayyarah, thereby placing themselves within striking distance of ISIS-held Mosul. A strategic pause ensued and it is expected that Iraqi forces-again supported by coalition fires, air support, and targeting teams-will begin the battle for Mosul in early FY 2017.

In  October  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  established  the Combined  Joint  Task  Force-Operation inherenT  resolve (CJTFOIR). The III Corps assumed authority of CJTF-OIR from the U.S. Army  Central  Command  in  September  2015.  The  XVIII  Airborne Corps assumed authority of CJTF-OIR from III Corps on 21 August 2016. In March 2016, the headquarters of the 82d Airborne Division relinquished command of the Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Iraq (CJFLCC) to the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division. During its nine-month tour commanding the CJFLCC, the division headquarters was responsible for the command and control of approximately 4,000 coalition troops from eighteen nations. They trained, advised, and assisted the Iraqi security forces and provided critical  capabilities  to  them.  The  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  101st Airborne Division, deployed to Iraq in May 2016. It replaced the 1st

Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, as the lead element for the CJFLCC's advise-and-assist mission.

Initially, the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, operated in the same manner as its predecessors. Americans were not permitted  to  deploy  with  Iraqi  units  below  the  echelon  of  division headquarters. Therefore the brigade combat team (BCT) focused on training division staffs and training and equipping Iraqi Army brigades at  facilities  near  Baghdad.  In  April  2016,  however,  the  president authorized  the  BCT  to  supply  advisers  who  would  accompany  the Iraqi  Army  brigade  and  battalion  headquarters  during  operations. Previously,  only  special  operations  troops  had  been  permitted  to move  beyond  division  headquarters  when  they  joined  the  Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi special forces units on some missions. The first use of this authorization came in July 2016, when the BCT assisted the Iraqi Army in installing a bridge over the Tigris River south of Mosul. American engineer advisers, positioned 250 meters from the bridge, coached their Iraqi counterparts, while the BCT provided fire support from its field artillery unit and coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles. An advise-and-assist team helped the Iraqi division leadership synchronize the operation.

The success of this operation soon confirmed that maintaining a persistent  presence  with  Iraqi  forces  during  combat  operations  was essential to defeating ISIS. This realization led to a shift in concept for the BCT from advise and assist to expeditionary advise and assist. This change required the mitigation of risk to the advise-and-assist teams by adding a security element to the teams. In August 2016, 400 soldiers from the BCT who had remained at Fort Campbell deployed to Iraq to provide that capability.

Strength in Iraq on 30 September 2015, was 2,923 Regular Army, 215 mobilized Army National Guard, and 92 mobilized Army Reserve. By 30 September 2016, Army personnel strength in Iraq had increased slightly to 3,080 Regular Army, 259 mobilized Army National Guard, and 401 mobilized Army Reserve. Other areas of Central Command, particularly  logistics  and  transportation  hubs,  continued  to  require Army personnel, most notably approximately 4,000 soldiers deployed in Kuwait. Army combat casualties for FY 2016 in Operation inherenT resolve were one killed and six wounded.

## U.S. Army, South

U.S. Army, South, is responsible for Army operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Normal personnel strength is  approximately  3,000  Regular  Army,  Army  Reserve,  and  Army

National  Guard  soldiers.  They  support  security  cooperation  and contingency operations, fulfill requirements for Title 10 support and combatant command, and back agent missions for the Department of the Army and the U.S. Southern Command. In 2016, Army South's regionally  aligned  force  was  the  Florida  Army  National  Guard's 53d Infantry Brigade Combat Team, which conducted training with regional  partners  to  combat  illicit  trafficking  of  narcotics,  humans, and weapons.

Exercises  in  2016  included:  medical  readiness  exercises; beyond The horizon , panamax , Tradewinds , and Fuerzas aliadas humaniTarias .  The  missions  of  Joint  Task  Forcebravo ,  stationed at  Soto  Cano  Air  Base,  Honduras,  and  its  primary  unit,  the  1st Battalion,  228th  Aviation  Regiment,  include  helicopter  support  to counter  organized  crime,  medical  readiness  training,  and  disasterrelief support. The 525th and 744th Military Police Battalions support Joint Task ForceguanTanamo .

## U.S. Army, Africa

In  October  2015,  the  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  3d  Infantry Division,  assumed  the  role  of  the  regionally  aligned  force  for  U.S. Army, Africa. During FY 2016, elements from the BCT deployed to Africa. They trained approximately 7,000 African soldiers in a wide variety of security cooperation missions; provided training in logistics and  peacekeeping  operations;  and  conducted  basic  and  advanced infantry training. Units also served tours as the East Africa Response Force,  based  at  Camp  Lemmonier  in  Djibouti.  Plans  call  for  the 1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  101st  Airborne  Division,  to  assume  the regionally aligned force mission in October 2016.

Army  forces  also  participated  in  the  annual CenTral  aCCord exercise  in  Gabon. CenTral  aCCord focuses  on  command-post  and field  training in order to foster partnerships, increase interoperability, and build the capacity of the participating African, U.S., and European forces.  In  addition  to  troops  from  the  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  3d Infantry  Division,  units  of  the  82d  Airborne  Division  conducted  an emergency deployment readiness exercise at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, followed  by  a  trans-Atlantic  airborne  operation  to  Gabon.  Once  in Gabon, they participated in two multinational airborne operations, a company live-fire exercise, and a multinational command post exercise.

In January 2016, U.S. Army, Africa, began planning to incorporate  a  full-time  internal  sustainment  capability.  Currently, Africa  Command  is  the  only  combatant  command  without  an assigned theater sustainment command. The U.S. Army, Africa, staff

therefore  must  replicate  the  functions  of  such  a  command  through memorandums of agreement with the U.S. European Command and the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. In FY 2016, the U.S. Army Reserve was tapped to provide this regionally aligned logistics support. The 79th Theater Sustainment Command will assume this mission late in FY 2017 after completing its transition from a sustainment support command to  a  theater  sustainment  command.  Until  that  time,  the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command, Fort Hood, Texas, will be assigned in early FY 2017 to Africa Command under the operational control of U.S. Army, Africa.

In  May  2016,  the  chief  of  staff,  Army,  joined  his  African counterparts to attend the African Land Forces Summit in Tanzania. The summit  theme was 'Building Security in Africa through Cooperation.'  The  leaders  discussed  a  variety  of  issues,  including poaching,  countering  improvised  explosive  devices,  transnational threats, and violent extremist organizations.

## Asia-Pacific

U.S. Army, Pacific, launched the Pacific Pathways initiative in 2014, combining  multiple  preexisting  exercises  with  partner  nations  into integrated operations. Each operation is a 'Pathway' for enhancing the readiness of participating forces, strengthening relationships with allies, and  providing  a  crisis-response  option  for  Pacific  Command.  Each Pathway operation deploys a battalion-sized task force and a brigade combat team headquarters for approximately ninety days to conduct a  series  of  exercises.  Pathway  15-2,  conducted  from  June  through October 2015, and using elements from the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, included exercises in Australia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Pathway 15-3, conducted from August through November 2015,  and  using  elements  from  the  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  25th Infantry  Division,  included  exercises  in  Mongolia,  Japan,  and  South Korea.  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  2d  Infantry  Division  conducted Pathway 16-1 from December 2015 through May 2016 with exercises in Thailand, South Korea, and the Philippines. The 2d Brigade Combat Team,  2d  Infantry  Division  led  Pathway  16-2  from  May  through September  2016  and  was  deployed  to  Thailand,  the  Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

In 2004, the governments of the United States and South Korea agreed to move all U.S. forces to garrisons south of the Han River, most  of  which  will  be  relocated  to  Camp  Humphreys,  about  forty miles south of Seoul on the country's west coast. During FY 2016, the relocation effort continued with construction of new facilities at Camp Humphreys. The final adjustment of the camp's perimeter fence, required  by  the  installation's  expansion  in  size  from  1,041  acres  to 3,453 acres, was made in September 2016. The first ground maneuver battalion from 2d Infantry Division relocated to Camp Humphreys in July 2016. It is expected that the move of units and headquarters will be completed during FY 2019.

The  brigade  combat  team  rotation  program  in  South  Korea continued.  The  1st  Brigade  Combat  Team,  1st  Cavalry  Division, began its  nine-month rotation in February 2016. It replaced the 2d Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, which completed the first rotation under this program, and it returned to Fort Hood, Texas.

## U.S. Army, Europe

U.S. Army, Europe's Operation aTlanTiC resolve demonstrates continued U.S. commitment to collective security. It reassures NATO allies  and  partners  of  America's  dedication  to  enduring  peace  and

stability in Europe after Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Regionally aligned units support U.S. Army Europe's assigned units in aTlanTiC resolve . The 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, supplies a mission-command element which oversees the rotational units and provides  a  division-level,  command-and-control  capability.  The  1st Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia, served  as  the  European  rotational  armored  brigade  from  March 2015 until September 2016. It conducted two, three-month rotations and one, six-month rotation, participating in multinational exercises across  twelve  countries  in  Europe.  The  3d  Brigade  Combat  Team, 4th  Infantry  Division,  Fort  Carson,  will  become  the  new  European rotational armored brigade early in FY 2017.

The  12th  Combat  Aviation  Brigade  is  stationed  in  Germany, but during FY 2015, it was reorganized from a brigade with seven battalions  to  one  with  two  battalions  as  part  of  the  Aviation Restructuring Initiative. In order to provide the theater with greater aviation capabilities, the Army began deploying an aviation battalion task  force  to  Germany  on  a  nine-month  rotation  in  FY  2015.  In November 2015, the 4th Battalion, 3d Aviation Regiment, completed

the  first  of  these  rotations  and  returned  to  Hunter  Army  Airfield, Georgia.  The  3d  Battalion,  227th  Aviation  Regiment,  Fort  Hood, Texas, replaced it. The Army, however, concluded in FY 2016 that Operation aTlanTiC resolve requires  additional  aviation  support. Therefore,  it  began  preparations  to  begin  deploying  in  FY  2017  a reinforced combat aviation brigade from the United States for a ninemonth rotation in Europe.



During fiscal year (FY) 2016, fiscal constraints and operational commitments led the Army to revise its logistical and modernization programs  to  focus  on  the  shorter-term  needs  of  deployed  forces. This near-term readiness emphasis created risk for future readiness with no new major modernization programs over the next decade. Complicating  this  situation  was  a  growing  threat  that  near-peer competitors could match U.S. military technological capabilities.

The  Army  responded  by  working  to  improve  the  use  of  its existing resources. It did this by implementing new accounting and management  systems;  identifying  equipment  that  could  either  be laterally transferred, destroyed, or sold; better calibrating production levels at arsenals and depots; and conducting tests of its accounting systems to prepare for congressionally mandated accounting requirements.  It  also  made  progress  in  restructuring  its  aviation programs to make them more cost-effective. At the same time, the service took the initiative to build up stores of supplies overseas that could  be  used  by  rapidly  deploying  troops  in  an  emergency,  and these troops practice using this equipment. In acquisitions, the Army launched a new office that could streamline the process involved in developing new capabilities and it began an assessment to recalibrate its  long-term  modernization  priorities.  During  the  fiscal  year,  the Army also decided to focus its limited resources where it believed it could gain the most for the forces in the near-term: attack helicopters; two different types of general purpose utility vehicles; its secure digital information network; and the principal air defense missile system.

## Readiness

A key logistical readiness initiative during FY 2016 was expansion of  equipment housed either afloat or ashore near areas of possible conflict. These  collections, designated as Army  Pre-positioned Stocks (APS), reduce the time needed to supply deployed forces. In December  2015,  the  deputy  secretary  of  defense  directed  that  the European Activity Set, used to support units on regionally alignedforces deployments to Europe, be converted into APS-2 as part of the European Reassurance Initiative. This conversion would take place

after the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, turned in the equipment once completing its rotation in September 2016. Future rotational forces would deploy with their own equipment from the continental United States. The Department of the Army published the execution order establishing APS-2 requirements in May 2016. In addition to the existing armored brigade combat team set, the order directed the pre-positioning of stocks for a division headquarters, a fires brigade, and a sustainment brigade.

U.S. Army, Europe, worked with host nations to obtain three sites for APS-2 in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. At the same time it ordered the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3d Infantry Division, to leave enough equipment to outfit a combined arms battalion at six temporary storage sites in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. These items will be moved to APS-2 sites once the next rotational armored brigade combat team rotates to Europe in January 2017. The Army Sustainment Command directed the 405th Army Field Support Brigade to provide mission command over APS-2 operations. This will require the brigade to establish operations at three APS-2 sites, develop each site's table of distribution and allowances, execute hiring plans, and reset European Activity Set equipment. At the same time, the brigade will have to operate the six temporary Eastern Europe

sites, then close these sites in addition to closing the two European Activity Set sites in Germany. Equipment from outside Europe for APS-2  began  arriving  in  September  2016  and  the  three  sites  are expected to be fully stocked by September 2017.

Logisticians  supported  the  program  of  expanded  Emergency Deployment  Readiness  Exercises  (EDRE).  During  these  exercises, the  Army  practiced  the  rapid  movement  of  troops  and  materiel  to test  the  deployment  system  and  ensure  the  readiness  of  units  and installations for this task. There were several EDREs during the year in which units moved by air from the continental United States to the Pacific region. Additionally, the 3d Brigade Combat Team (BCT), 101st Airborne Division, executed the first sealift EDRE in over a decade in conjunction with its rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort  Polk,  Louisiana.  It  sent  more  than  800  pieces  of  rolling  stock and containers by rail from Fort Campbell to the Port of Jacksonville, Florida,  where  they  were  loaded  onto  a  Military  Sealift  Command ship and transported to Port Arthur, Texas. After the equipment was unloaded, soldiers of the 3d BCT moved it to Fort Polk.

## Management

Global Combat  Support  System-Army  (GCSS-Army)  is  a logistics and financial system for both units and installations. It tracks supplies, spare parts, organizational equipment, unit maintenance, and  financial  transactions  related  to  logistics.  The  system,  based on  a  commercial  software  program,  replaces  the  Standard  Army Management Information Systems and integrates about 40,000 local supply and logistics databases. The system is being fielded using the wave approach to avoid disruption to ongoing operations.

Wave  1  fielding,  begun  in  February  2013,  was  completed  in November 2015. In total, 281 supply support activities received this wave which replaced the Standard Army Retail Supply System, the Single  Stock  Fund/Middleware,  and  the  Funds  Control  Module. Wave 2 will replace the Property Book Unit Supply-Enhanced and the Standard Maintenance System-Enhanced. Full deployment for Wave 2 began in August 2015 and is scheduled for completion in November 2017.  The  Wave  2  effort  has  forty-four  materiel  fielding  teams  and roughly three times as many simultaneous fielding events as Wave 1.

The Logistics  Modernization  Program  (LMP),  underway  since 2003,  replaces  the  two  largest  national-level  logistics  systems:  the inventory management Commodity Command Standard System, and the depot and arsenal operations' Standard Depot System. The LMP will transform Army logistics operations in eight core business areas:

acquisition,  distribution,  finance,  product  life-cycle  management, supply-chain  planning, depots and  arsenals, maintenance,  and warehouse inventory management. As with GCSS-Army, the service made use of existing commercially available technology, instead of developing an entirely new one, and it began implementing the new system in waves.

In May 2016, the service completed fielding LMP Increment 2, which  was  deployed  to  Army  industrial  base  sites  in  three  waves beginning  in  January  2014.  Increment  2  expanded  on  the  already operational production baseline to specifically address shopfloor  automation,  automatic  identification  technology,  expanded ammunition requirements, strategic business-transformation goals, and specific Department of Defense (DoD) directives, such as item unique identification. The expanded capabilities of Increment 2 enable the LMP to provide mission-critical information about production activities across the supply chain. Completion of Increment 2 brings the total number of LMP users to 30,000 at more than 50 locations around  the  world.  Transition  of  sustainment  services  for  LMP from the prime contractor to the Army Shared Services Center was completed during June 2016.

The  Army  took  a  number  of  actions  during  the  year  to  gain better control of its existing supplies and support activities. The G-4, working with the Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Defense Logistics Agency, located over 130,000 items worth more than $3.9 billion that could be divested, and it made significant progress toward removing these items from its stocks. This program eliminated 9,188 tactical wheeled vehicles, saving almost $20 million, and sold off fiftyone UH-60A helicopters, garnering nearly $40 million that would be used to procure newer versions of the Blackhawk. Along with sales and  divestiture,  the  Army  also  identified  nearly  70,000  items  that could be laterally transferred to where they were needed most and it had units turn in nearly 148,000 pieces of excess equipment.

In February 2016, the G-4 directed a review of BCT-authorized stockage lists (ASL). The ASL is a listing of the units' repair parts, general supplies, common hardware, and specialized maintenance and supply tools. The review concluded that BCTs with similar missions had very dissimilar stockage lists. This finding led the G-4-working with Forces Command, AMC, and various Army service component commands-to  begin  a  multiyear  program  in  September  2016  to develop a common authorized stockage list for BCTs.

The Army was also active during the year in efforts to manage more  effectively  the  five  depots  and  three  manufacturing  arsenals that  make  up  its  organic  industrial  base.  A  key  initiative  was  an

assessment  to  determine  what  production  levels  facilities  need  to maintain during a peacetime operational tempo, while also allowing them to expand quickly during national emergencies. The Industrial Base Directorate in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition,  Logistics,  and  Technology),  established  in  FY  2015, worked with the G-4 and AMC to make this assessment. As a result of the assessment, the Army developed a personnel plan that decreased the service's reliance on contractors, and created over $100 million in cost avoidance without reducing productivity. It also reduced the number of direct-labor hours it required at its depots by 2.5 million, but it maintained enough work in support of other services to ensure that  the  equipment  and  skilled  labor  at  these  depots  would  be available during national emergencies. As part of this undertaking, the offices began revising Army Regulation 700-90, Army Industrial Base Process , last issued in FY 2014, to provide guidance on the best methods for calculating production levels.

In  April  2015,  the  chief  of  staff,  Army,  put  G-4  in  charge of  revamping  the  service's  system  of  approving,  producing,  and distributing soldier organizational clothing and individual equipment. During FY 2016, G-4 explored ways of reducing the more than 200 soldier equipment menus to just five core ones and investigated ways to reduce the number of issuing facilities. It also explored a number of options for delivering clothing directly to soldiers or units using a Web-based system. It began testing these new concepts at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, during the second quarter of the year.

During  FY  2016,  the  service  examined  options  for  providing soldiers with quick and healthy food options in field environments and in other locations where it may be difficult to access a dining facility. Although vendor food trucks are allowed on installations through the Army and Air Force Exchange Service or the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation activities, the Joint Culinary Center of Excellence (part of the U.S. Army Quartermaster School) concluded that soldiers should also  have  this  option  as  part  of  the  service's  food  program.  Those who are meal-card holders will be able to use their meal cards at food trucks, but the trucks will include a point-of-sale system that allows diners to pay with cash as well. The Center will purchase three food trucks and test this concept on posts in the continental United States during FY 2017.

The DoD directed the Army to develop better accounting for the large quantity of government-furnished property held by contractors. During FY 2016, the service estimated that there were nearly 96,000 items, worth almost $1.5 billion, in 40,235 open contracts. To improve documentation and management of this equipment, the Army created

a new online form to account for the materiel, updated its policies to align them with Federal Acquisition Regulations and DoD Training Guidance, and included a separate category for these items in the GCSS-Army and LMP systems.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The  Army  continued  procuring  the  latest  generation  attack helicopter,  the  AH-64E  Apache  Guardian,  during  FY  2016-the first of which were delivered in 2011. Among the new capabilities of this Apache model are control of unmanned aerial systems; improved performance  with  701D  engines;  composite  main  rotor  blades; enhanced rotor drive system; and satellite communication with an integrated  communication  suite.  In  April  2016,  Army  Contracting Command  awarded  a  contract  for  remanufacturing  117  AH-64D models into AH-64E models. The acquisition objective is to procure 690  aircraft-56  built  as  E-models  and  634  remanufactured  from D-models.

The  Armored  Multi-Purpose  Vehicle  (AMPV)  will  replace  the M113 family of vehicles, a design first fielded in the 1960s, of which approximately  3,000  variants  remain  in  service.  The  AMPV  will replace the M113 at the brigade level and below in five roles: general purpose, medical evacuation, medical treatment, mortar carrier, and mission command. The Army needs the AMPV because of mobility and survivability deficiencies in the M113. The M113's space, weight, power,  and  cooling  limitations  also  prevent  the  incorporation  of future technologies in them. The AMPV entered system development in December 2014. Though the AMPV utilizes a new hull design, it is derived from the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and a majority of AMPV subsystems are derived from the Bradley.

Before AMPV's critical design review, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Engineering assessed that the vehicle's preliminary design might not meet survivability and force protection  requirements.  In  response,  the  program  requested  and received approval from the Army Requirements Oversight Council to  modify  the  system's  survivability  requirement  as  well  as  several key  system  attributes.  In  September  2016,  the  Joint  Requirements Oversight Council validated the survivability requirement change.

Although the program held its critical design review in June 2016 with over 90 percent of its design drawings released to manufacturing, the  program  had  not  yet  demonstrated  a  system-level  integrated prototype. The contractor started building AMPV prototypes in May 2016  to  support  design  demonstration  and  developmental  testing.

JLTV



However, delays related to the release of engineering drawings and manufacturing-planning efforts created disruptions. Delivery of the first prototype was expected in December 2016.

The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is an Army and Marine Corps program to produce vehicles with companion trailers. There will be two-  and  four-seat variants and  four  mission-package configurations:  general  purpose,  heavy-guns  carrier,  close-combatweapons  carrier,  and  a  utility/shelter  carrier.  In  August  2015,  the Army awarded a firm, fixed price production contract for low-rate, initial production. It started in the first quarter of FY 2016. The Army and  the  Marine  Corps  will  procure  approximately  17,000  vehicles under the contract. A decision on full-rate production should come in  FY  2018.  Army  procurement  of  the  vehicles  is  expected  to  last until approximately 2040, totaling 49,099 vehicles. In May 2016, the Army announced that it had selected the JLTV as the platform for a light reconnaissance vehicle instead of procuring a new system. This version of the vehicle will replace the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles used in the reconnaissance units of infantry brigade combat teams.

In September 2015, one of the corporations which had competed for the contract, but had not been selected, filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO). It claimed that its design

for the JLTV was more capable and more affordable. Work on the program stopped while the GAO reviewed the protest. In December 2015,  the  GAO  dismissed  the  protest  because  the  corporation  had decided to file a 'Notice of Post-Award Bid Protest' with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as well. Immediately after the GAO dismissed the protest, the Army instructed the contractor to resume work on the JLTV order. The corporation withdrew its protest in the Court of Federal Claims in February 2016. The work stoppage created a sixmonth delay in reaching initial operational capability, which is now expected to occur in late 2019 instead of mid-2019. The Army received its first seven JLTVs for testing in September 2016.

The Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T)  is the Army's  Internet  Protocol-based  satellite and  line-of-sightcommunications  network  which  supports  voice,  data,  and  video communications  for  units  at  theater  level  and  below.  The  service approved the WIN-T program requirements in December 2000 and the  system  is  being  fielded  in  three  increments.  In  2012,  the  Army completed fielding  the  first  increment  which  created  an  at-the-halt network backbone that provides the full  range  of  data,  voice,  and video communications to command posts at the battalion echelon and  above.  In  2014,  fiscal  constraints  led  the  Army  to  restructure the third increment, which was to have produced a full networkingon-the-move capability using airborne communications relays. This change  eliminated  the  requirements  for  hardware  but  retained  the development efforts to complete the network operations software and the  Network  Centric  Waveform  10.x  software  upgrade,  which  will then be used to update Increments 1 and 2.

During FY 2016, the service continued the fielding of the second increment, which had begun in 2012. This increment provides an initial on-the-move capability as well as a robust line-of-sight transmission network  and  greater  satellite  data  for  division  headquarters  and down to the company level for maneuver brigades. Fiscal constraints led to the FY 2016 budget having fewer Increment 2 sets procured than originally programmed for the year, postponing fielding in one infantry brigade combat team, one division headquarters, one infantry BCT engineer company, and one maneuver support battalion.

Work on WIN-T's third increment continued during FY 2016. In  October  2015,  the  Army  conducted  a  WIN-T  Increment  3 Government Developmental Test of the enhanced Network Centric Waveform  10.1.2b  at  Aberdeen  Proving  Ground,  Maryland.  An operational  assessment  of  the  increment  occurred  during  the Network Integration Evaluation 16.2 in May 2016. This assessment employed  the  2d  Brigade  Combat  Team,  1st  Armored  Division,

conducting  operationally  realistic  missions  at  Fort  Bliss,  Texas, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. In September 2016, the  Army  acquisition  executive  approved  the  deployment  of  the increment's  network  operations  and  Network  Centric  Waveform enhancements. In June 2016, the Product Manager WIN-T Increment 3 office was redesignated the Product Manager Tactical Cyber and Network Operations. The new title better reflected the office's changing responsibilities. No longer focused on just WIN-T systems, it now supports the full range of devices and services on the mission command network.

In  its  report  for  FY  2015,  released  in  January  2016,  DoD's Office of the Director, Operational  Test  &amp;  Evaluation,  stated that  the  WIN-T  Increment  2  could  not  survive  on  the  battlefield. Although improved, the office found that this increment continued to  demonstrate  serious  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities.  The  Under Secretary  of  Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics, when he approved the program to enter full-rate production in June 2015,  also  directed  the  Army  to  correct  performance  deficiencies and  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  testing.  The  Johns Hopkins University and the Army Research Laboratory conducted an assessment in FY 2016 that recommended improvements to usertraining  techniques  and  procedures,  and  hardware  and  software enhancements to reinforce against threats. Efforts continued during FY 2016 to address these cybersecurity issues.

Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) is a command and control  system  that  integrates  sensors,  weapons,  and  a  common mission command  capability. During FY  2016, the program conducted  limited-user  testing  to  collect  data  on  the  IAMD's operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability. This testing found that IAMD's software was still immature. In August 2016, the decision on whether to commence low-rate production, planned for November 2016, was placed on hold until software deficiencies were fixed. Fiscal Year 2018 is the programmed date for the start of fullrate production.

The Patriot surface-to-air missile remains the cornerstone of air and missile defense. During FY 2016, several developments enhanced its capabilities. The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment  Enhancement  (MSE)  is  the  latest  version  of  the  PAC-3 missile, with increased battlespace defense capabilities and improved lethality.  The  PAC-3  MSE  program  achieved  initial  operational capability in July 2016, ahead of schedule. The Patriots successfully engaged ballistic missile and air-breathing threats during tests. This demonstrated for the first time an interception of a ballistic missile

with  a  hit-to-kill  PAC-3  MSE  interceptor  and  a  Patriot  Guided Enhanced Missile-tactical ballistic missile, in a ripple-method fire.

In FY 2016, the Army made a major modification to the Network Integration  Evaluation  (NIE)  program.  Begun  in  2011,  the  NIEs were  held  twice  a  year  at  Fort  Bliss,  with  a  focus  on  operational testing  of  equipment,  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures.  This testing  permitted  a  more  comprehensive  evaluation  of  integrated mission-command  networks  than  is  possible  through  evaluations of individual network components. From the start of the program, a dedicated unit, 2d Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division, was used during every NIE. This policy produced a depth of organizational learning on how to conduct these evaluations that ensured effective testing. However, shrinking force structure and the commitment to deploy a rotational armored brigade to Europe meant that 2d Armored Brigade Combat Team could no longer be dedicated to evaluation mission. Instead, the NIE mission will be filled by other brigades on a rotational basis.

## Foreign Military Sales

The  Army's  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  program  is  part  of the  Defense  Security  Assistance  program,  which  transfers  defense articles and services to friendly foreign countries and international organizations.  The  FMS program is managed by the Office of the Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army,  Defense  Exports  and Cooperation (DE&amp;C), which oversaw $14.8 billion in international sales  of  Army  equipment,  training,  supplies  and  services  during the  year,  with  the  Central  Command  region  being  the  largest recipient.  Reflective  of  the  importance  the  U.S.  government  places on maintaining the stability of these programs, the Army received approval  in  FY  2016  to  make  all  FMS  positions  exempt  from restructuring  and  personnel  reductions.  Of  particular  importance was the anti-ISIS program under Operation inherenT resolve . Since November 2014, the Army has provided over $2 billion in war materiel under  this  program  to  equip  ten  Iraqi  Security  Forces  Brigades, two Peshmerga Brigades, a number of counterterrorism units, and assorted paramilitary forces. The  materiel included individual equipment, light and heavy machine guns, antitank weapons, nonU.S. weapons, ammunition, vehicles, communications devices, and medical supplies.

Outside of Central Command, the office oversaw triple the amount of sales and training activity in Europe as compared to FY 2015. Key in these efforts was a $2.5 billion agreement to remanufacture AH-64

Apache  helicopters  for  the  United  Kingdom;  and  $158  million  in support of operations in Ukraine. In the Pacific region, U.S. Army sales activity was nearly double the amount in FY 2015, including the sale of $932 million in AH-64E Apache helicopters to India. At the end of the year, the Army still had 5,636 partially completed sales or service transactions with 152 different countries that would be valued at $176 billion when completed. In addition to direct sales and service, the  DE&amp;C  also  supported  the  Army's  review  and  adjudication  of 6,350 commercial export licenses. The office also supported 10,978 training sessions for allies at U.S. Army schools, and the deployment of thirty-eight training teams to twenty-three different countries.

In addition to sales, DE&amp;C  helped  conclude  twenty  new armaments cooperation agreements during the year under the FMS program, in which the nations involved collaborated on research and development efforts.  Along  with  these  new  efforts,  it  also  oversaw 517 ongoing collaborative efforts with thirty-five different countries. Altogether, these programs were valued at $327 million in research, development,  testing,  and  evaluation.  One  of  the  more  significant collaborations was the first ever U.S.-Japan Service to Service Forum, which was held 26-29 July 2016 in Tokyo, Japan. During the forum, defense officials and industry representatives from both nations met to share information on a number of equipment programs of mutual interest.  Similarly,  the  office  sponsored  a  number  of  forums  with India under the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, during which defense and industry representatives discussed bilateral cooperation on military research and development efforts. As a result of  these  forums,  the  U.S.  Army  formed  two  working  groups  with Indian  defense  offices,  one  on  chemical  and  biological  protection equipment, and another on materiel systems and technology.

## Reserve Components

Organizational Structure and Personnel

The Army National Guard (ARNG) had an authorized strength of 342,000 soldiers in fiscal year (FY) 2016, which was down 8,200 from  FY  2015.  Even  with  the  reduction,  however,  the  component still comprised roughly 39 percent of the Army's overall operational force: its combat arms, combat support, and combat service support. Supporting these soldiers were roughly 1,500 full-time Army civilians. Structurally,  the  ARNG  was  divided  into  fourteen  command  and control headquarters during the year. They included eight divisional and  two  expeditionary  sustainment  commands,  along  with  one headquarters each for Army air and missile defense, military police, theater aviation, and theater sustainment. Additionally, the Guard had 2 special forces groups, 27 brigade combat teams, 45 multifunctional support  brigades,  51  functional  support  brigades  and  groups,  and 514 modified tables of equipment (MTOE) battalions.

The Army National Guard Directorate, located at Arlington Hall, Virginia, reported to the National Guard Bureau, and administered the  ARNG's  programs.  The  directorate  consisted  of  the  Office  of the  Director,  ARNG,  and  the  Army  National  Guard  Readiness Center. The ARNG Directorate instituted one major organizational change  during  FY  2016.  In  May,  it  created  the  Installations  and Environment Directorate as a separate ARNG G-Staff equivalent organization. The new directorate took over operation of the Guard G-4's  Installations  and  Environmental  division,  and  the  ARNG functionally aligned it with the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for  Installation  Management.  The  change  allowed  the  ARNG  to reduce its staffing requirements.

The U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) experienced no major changes to its organization or mission during the year. The USAR maintained nearly  1,100  reserve  centers  and  training  facilities,  six  installations, and  equipment  inventories  valued  at  more  than  $39  billion.  The organization that was responsible for implementing USAR's plans and programs during the year was the U.S. Army Reserve Command. The command oversaw eight operational commands during the year, which

could be fully deployed as headquarters, individual units, or both. It also directed seven functional command headquarters, which were not deployable, although the individual units assigned to them could be; seven support commands, which provided support services for base operations services, administration, personnel, logistics, retention, and liaison; and seven training commands, which were responsible for the routine training of soldiers in all components.

## Mobilization

In FY 2016, the ARNG mobilized 460 units, with a total of 10,291 soldiers,  of  which  9,930  served  overseas  ( Table  8 ).  It  also  provided 361  personnel  to  support  the  National  Capitol  Region-Integrated Air  Defense  System,  commanded  by  North  American  Aerospace Defense  Command/U.S.  Army  Northern  Command.  The  ARNG contributed command and control elements made up of its air defense artillery brigades from seven battalions in five different states. These units worked with a number of different agencies, including the Air National Guard, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and Army air and missile defense units.

The cyber-defense mission remained an important ARNG priority during the year. In FY 2015, the ARNG began standing-up cyberprotection teams to protect critical Army network infrastructure. The teams were made up of soldiers with specialized skills in information technology garnered from  their government  and  private sector careers. After selection, the soldiers received special training for their missions by U.S. Army Cyber Command. The ARNG added seven new teams during the year to join four that it had already established. When combined with Air National Guard cyber assets, the National Guard Bureau planned to have cyber assets in each of the ten Federal Emergency Management Agency response regions.

During FY 2016, the ARNG participated in two major exercises in Europe involving U.S. forces and other nations. Between 1 May and 13  September, personnel from engineer units and a signal battalion deployed  to  Europe  to  participate  in  Operation resoluTe  CasTle 16,  a  special  engineer  exercise.  The  soldiers  deployed  to  Europe  in seven rotations of twenty-two days each, and participated in events in Estonia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In addition, between July and August, the 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team from Idaho and the 122d Engineer Battalion from South Carolina participated in a U.S. Army, Europe-led NATO exercise, Operation saber guardian .  The exercise, which took place in Romania, involved approximately 2,800 military personnel from ten nations in an effort to promote regional

stability  and  security  between  NATO  and  Partnership  for  Peace member nations, and to improve interoperability between militaries.

On 30 September 2016, the ARNG ended one of its long-standing federal  support  missions,  Operation phalanx ,  which  had  begun  in July 2010. Over its six years of operation, the ARNG had committed significant amounts of personnel and equipment to assist U.S. Customs and  Border  Protection  in  its  defense  of  the  U.S.-Mexican  border against illegal immigration and transnational criminal activities. While the units remained under state control, their expenses were paid with federal funds. Most of these operations had involved aerial detection and monitoring using UH-72A  Lakota  helicopters. Operation phalanx was originally scheduled to end in December 2016, but by September the Guard had already reduced its commitment to only a hundred personnel-most of whom were performing detection and monitoring  with  aerial  assets,  criminal  analysis,  and  command  and control missions.

In  FY  2016,  the  Army  mobilized  ARNG  personnel  for  a  total of  1,082,410  workdays  under  a  mix  of  Title  10  and  Title  32  for domestic missions. Of these call-ups, sixty were for natural disaster events, including the Hurricane Joaquin, Hurricane Lester, Hurricane Hermine,  and  Tropical  Storm  Darby.  There  were  also  twentyeight  special  and  nontraditional  events,  including  the  papal  visit to  Washington,  D.C.  and  Texas;  the  Nuclear  Security  Summit;  the National Collegiate Athletic Association Football Championship; the National Football League Super Bowl; Independence Day celebrations; special support missions to Washington D.C. museums; the Breeder's

Cup; the Kentucky Derby; the Boston Marathon; the Las Vegas New Year's Eve celebration; and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

In FY 2016, Army Reservists were deployed at home and abroad, including supporting operations in Afghanistan; civil affairs missions in the Horn of Africa; deterrence operations in Kuwait; military police operations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; medical support operations at facilities in Honduras; and responding to natural disasters ( Table 9 ).

Key to the ability to deploy these forces effectively was the USAR's system  of  Army  Reserve  Engagement  Cells  and  Army  Reserve Engagement Teams. These cells provided technical and tactical advice on  USAR  capabilities  to  Army  Service  Component  Commands (ASCCs) and field armies, and they helped mobilize the right personnel for specific missions and training exercises. By FY 2016, the USAR had been able to place these cells in six of the nine ASCCs, but it was still trying to get them fully staffed during the year.

## Readiness

A key readiness indicator, total equipment on hand, showed some signs of improvement during the year for the ARNG. In FY 2016, the ARNG had 93 percent of its required MTOE. By comparison, the MTOE rate in FY 2011 had been only 77 percent. Additionally, for critical  dual-use  equipment-those  MTOE  items  deemed  necessary for both state and federal missions-the on-hand level was 89 percent.

Going forward the ARNG was programmed to receive approximately $12.8 billion in new equipment in FYs 2017-2021.

In September 2016, the chief of staff, Army, approved a plan that the  ARNG had developed during the year to improve its readiness over  a  five-year  period  beginning  in  FY  2017.  The  plan,  known  as ARNG 4.0,  would  increase  the  readiness  and  availability  of  select ARNG armor and Stryker brigade combat teams (BCTs) by the close of FY 2019. As part of the change, the ARNG would transition from a  five-year  training  cycle  to  a  four-year  one  beginning  in  FY  2017. The plan also increases the number of training days from thirty-nine to fifty-one for certain units to achieve target readiness levels, and to allow for increased unit rotations at the Combat Training Centers.

The ARNG planned to implement ARNG 4.0 in three phases: Phase 1-Policy and Guidance Development, would be implemented in FYs 2016 to 2017. During this time, Guard leaders would focus on  drafting  guidance  for  the  building  and  training  that  would be  implemented  between  FYs  2019  and  2023.  In  Phase  2-Initial Operating  Capability,  the  ARNG  would  begin  to  implement  the new guidance for select BCTs during FY 2018. Under Phase 3-Full Operational Capability, in FY 2019, Guard leaders expect to reduce postmobilization training time for select BCTs to sixty days.

Throughout the fiscal  year,  the  ARNG  continued  to  contribute to the State Partnership Program. Inaugurated in 1993, the program links  ARNG  units  directly  with  the  military  units  of  U.S.  allies  to develop  long-term  relationships  in  accordance  with  U.S.  foreignpolicy objectives. These units conducted regular military-to-military and  interagency  activities,  including  maneuver-  and  combat-related tasks; security; disaster response and mitigation; crisis management; interagency cooperation; border, port, and aviation security; fellowship-style internships; and combat medical training. During the year, the ARNG maintained seventy unique security partnerships.

Because  of  severe  budget  and  personnel  cuts,  the  USAR  saw readiness  and  training  levels  decline.  By  making  special  efforts  to conserve its resources, the USAR had been able to maintain training for critical units supporting combatant commanders abroad. However, many of these missions required additional training days because of their  complexity,  and  the  command  was  not  certain  funds  for  such training would be forthcoming from Congress. The USAR also had significant  backlogs  in  professional  military  education  and  military occupational specialty qualification training and insufficient full-time support personnel to provide for day-to-day administration, personnel, medical, training, recruiting, mobilization, and other functions.

## Bold Shift

During FY 2016, First Army completed its Bold Shift restructuring. First Army advises, assists, and trains reserve component units so that they can achieve their directed readiness requirements both before and after mobilization. Begun in 2014, Bold Shift is part of the service's efforts  to  transition  from  the  predictable  deployment  cycles  of  the Iraq and Afghan wars to a new environment featuring a smaller force that must prepare for changing global commitments and a renewed emphasis  on  high-intensity  combined  arms.  This  requires  reserve component  units  to  maintain  a  higher  readiness  level  in  order  to minimize the time between mobilization and deployment. First Army, therefore,  shifted  its  focus  from  operating  postmobilization  training sites  to  improving  unit  mission  essential  skills  during  weekend  and annual training periods. First Army also used the program to comply with the service's  organizational  redesign  directive  to  reduce  2-  and 3-star headquarters staffs.

First Army's end-state structure, effective 1 October 2016, consists of nine modular training support brigades (TSB) and provides a 32 percent increase of observer coach/trainers through reduction of the headquarters staffs and a reduction from sixteen to nine TSBs. The six combined arms training brigades (CATBs) are organized to provide training  support  to  ARNG  BCTs,  but  also  have  the  capability  to support ARNG and USAR functional/multifunctional formations to meet  premobilization  readiness  requirements.  The  CATBs  generally consist of two maneuver battalions, one fires battalion, one brigade engineer battalion, and one brigade support battalion. MultiFunctional Training Brigades (MFTBs) are organized into functional/ multifunctional brigades. The MFTBs consist of two brigade engineer battalions  and  three  brigade  support  battalions  which  are  staffed with the appropriate specialties to provide the required expertise. All of First Army's brigades are composed of both Regular Army and reserve  component  soldiers.  Under  Bold  Shift,  First  Army  aligned its  subordinate division and brigade headquarters with their reserve component counterparts based primarily on geographic location and like-unit  capabilities.  These  habitual  partnerships  focus  on  mutual cooperation  between  partner  units  to  increase  reserve  component premobilization readiness.

## Associated Units Pilot Program

The  Associated  Units  Pilot  Program  began  in  FY  2016.  It is  a  multiyear  test  of  a  new  concept  to  increase  readiness  and

responsiveness  of  the  Army  as  a  total  force.  The  program  uses the secretary of the Army's authority to associate units of reserve components with Regular Army units for training oversight before mobilization. When the secretary of the Army designates associated units,  the  association  relationship  modifies  administrative  control. The Regular Army unit commander is now responsible for approving the associated unit's training program, reviewing its readiness report, assessing its resource requirements, and confirming collective proficiency. Association also helps units from different components train together.

In addition to training with Regular Army units, reserve component units selected for the pilot were provided with additional resources to sustain higher readiness. They will have up to fifteen additional days of training each year. They will have more frequent rotations at combat training  centers  or  other  capstone  training  events  based  on  their type of unit. Regular and reserve component units in an associated relationship  will  be  staffed  to  ensure  sufficient  available  personnel to execute the training strategy, will exchange assigned personnel to enhance  mutual  understanding  across  components,  and  will  wear common patches. Associated units will not be required to maintain the exact same modernization levels, but must be compatible to ensure they can train and fight together. The pilot program will last for three years and after that time an assessment will be made to decide how the program could expand.

Units participating in the pilot program are:

- · 3d  BCT,  10th  Mountain  Division,  stationed  at  Fort  Polk, Louisiana,  associated  with  the  36th  Infantry  Division, Texas ARNG
- · 86th Infantry BCT, Vermont ARNG, associated with the 10th Mountain Division, stationed at Fort Drum, New Y ork

## Support Services

Installation Management

The  Office  of  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for  Installation Management (OACSIM), in response to a Center for Army Analysis study  published  in  March  2016,  started  an  initiative  in  fiscal  year (FY)  2016  to  improve  the  reimbursement  for  services  provided  to non-Army tenant units. The study recommended updating outdated policy and standardizing business practices that inhibit installations from collecting non-Army tenant funds. The OACSIM updated Army Regulation  5-9 Installation  Support  Agreements ;  developed  training modules for garrison  commanders; gained installation  management command  support  to  add  an  instruction  module  to  the  garrison leader's course; and published a handbook with how-to procedures for collecting funds from non-Army tenants.

In September 2016, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Strategic Integration) (ODASA  (SI)),  within  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy, and  Environment)  (OASA  (IE&amp;E)),  published  the  second  version of Installations,  Energy  and  Environment  Strategy  2025 , covering FYs 2017-2025. The document is an important part of the Army's performance management process. It provides benchmarks that allow the Army to assess its overall efficiency and effectiveness in the areas of installations,  energy,  and  the  environment.  This  document  will  be  refined and updated biennially as directed. The ODASA (SI) developed the document in collaboration with OACSIM, Headquarters, Department of the Army, G-4, the Chief Information Officer, G-6, and others, as well as with key Department of Defense (DoD) partners.

Installations  are  platforms  for  Army  readiness.  They  provide secure  and  sustainable  facilities  and  infrastructure  that  support combatant  commanders'  top  priorities,  enable Army  missions, and sustain soldier  and  unit  readiness.  Yet  even  though  the  Army has processes that examine future warfighting capability, it has no corresponding  process  to  examine  the  future  of  installations-an essential  component  of  readiness.  To  address  this  gap,  the  Army began  exploring  a  futures  process  for  its  installations.  The  OASA

(IE&amp;E) launched an initiative in April 2016 to examine the long-term future of Army installations with ODASA (SI) as the lead element. Pilot studies on the future of installation-related functions such as multipurpose buildings, communal spaces, and campus-style dining were launched in September 2016. They were modeled on the Army's existing  institutional  methods  that  examine  its  future  operating environment. This initiative is  consistent  with  the Army Operating Concept and Force 2025 and Beyond.

In December 2015, the Army updated its policy on child, youth, and school services programs to incorporate guidance in an August 2014 DoD directive. The changes revised eligibility criteria for using these programs. All individuals who have contact with children in any Army child, youth, and school services program must now complete DD Form 2981 (Basic Criminal History and Statement of Admission). The update provided a list of training topics for all regularly scheduled volunteers.

## Housing and Infrastructure

In June 2016, OACSIM  began on-site barracks-condition assessments  and  coupled  them  with  analysis  of  all  unaccompanied housing inventory records. The  information gained from these inventories  and  assessments  supports  development  of  a  barracks master plan and informs implementation of a 2+0 Barracks Assignment Policy. It also identifies excess unaccompanied housing for demolition or repurposing; supports the development of maintenance and  repair  requirements  to  address  quality  deficits;  and  assists  in focusing  limited  sustainment,  maintenance,  and  repair  funding  on validated requirements.

Before  the  Budget  Control  Act  of  2011,  installations  relied  on year-of-execution  reprograming  to  meet  critical  needs,  but  the  act ended  this  practice.  The  military  construction  budget  for  FY  2016 covered only 34 percent of requirements. Only 70 percent of facility sustainment and 23 percent of restoration and modernization requirements were funded in FY 2016. Continued underfunding has resulted in accelerated degradation of facilities; by the end of 2016, almost 20 percent of Army facilities were in poor or failing condition.

## Property Transfer

The Army continued to transfer properties identified by the 2005 Base  Realignment  and  Closure  Commission  (BRAC  2005)  for  real property disposal or conveyance. In FY 2016, it reached resolution

of two conveyances of land. One was the remaining 566 acres of Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, which were transferred to the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority. The other was the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where thirty-two acres were transferred to the Department of State for redevelopment as a foreign missions center and  twelve  acres  were  conveyed  to  the  Children's  National  Health System for public health research facilities. The OACSIM conveyed an additional 1,576 acres of excess installation property, including eight Army Reserve sites selected by the BRAC 2005. Property outside of the BRAC 2005 also was transferred, including the final 294-acre parcel of the Indiana Army Ammunition Plant. The OACSIM continued to oversee BRAC 2005 properties which continued to generate revenue through leases and land sales. The service received almost $117 million in  revenue  from  this  source  during  the  year  and  used  the  proceeds to  accelerate  the  remaining  environmental  cleanup  at  BRAC  2005 installations.

## Privatized Army Lodging

Since 2009, the Army has had leasing arrangements with private sector developers to modernize visitor lodging on Army installations. As part of this program, the service opened a new Candlewood Suites at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, in March 2016. Although this hotel is only a small portion of the Privatized Army Lodging program, which encompasses 12,492 guestrooms across forty-one Army installations, it is the first hotel in the country to be constructed entirely using crosslaminated timber (CLT)-a modern, large-scale, prefabricated, solid, engineered-wood-panel  material.  The  building  is  environmentally friendly,  and  the  CLT  construction  will  provide  31  percent  energy savings. Furthermore, the facility was built 37 percent faster than it would have taken to build a similar-sized structure using conventional framing materials and methods. Additional facilities of this type are planned for FY 2017 at Fort Drum, New York, and Joint Base LewisMcChord, Washington.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  provides retail and restaurant services on Army and Air Force installations in the United States and overseas. It provides online shopping and credit card services as well. The AAFES is directed by a board of directors responsible  to  the  secretaries  of  the  Army  and  Air  Force  through those services' chief of staff. During FY 2016, AAFES operated in

thirty-six countries in addition to its operations in the United States. It  ran  more  than  2,700  facilities.  There  were  approximately  1,750 quick-serve  restaurants  under  licenses,  such  as  Starbucks,  Subway, and Boston Market. Additionally, the exchange operated more than 3,600 concession operations, and forty-seven contingency operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Poland, Kosovo, and elsewhere.

Approximately two-thirds of AAFES earnings are used to support morale, welfare, and recreation programs. The remaining one-third is used to construct new stores, modernize regional distribution centers, and upgrade AAFES retail stores. In FY 2016, AAFES had revenue of $8.3 billion and earnings of $384 million. The year's dividends totaled $225 million, of which the Army received $128 million.

## Safety

During  FY  2016,  109  soldiers  died  in  accidents,  one  less  than in FY 2015. There were a total of 135 aviation and ground Class A accidents in FY 2016, six less than the previous fiscal year. Aviation, both piloted and remotely operated, experienced twenty-eight Class A  accidents,  whereas  ground  on-  and  off-duty  incidents  combined accounted for the remaining 107. Overall, Army aviation experienced sixty-four Class A-C crewed aircraft accidents. This was a 21 percent decrease  from  the  eighty-one  Class  A-C  aircraft  accidents  reported in  FY 2015. Historically, human error contributes to approximately 80 percent of all Army aviation accidents and it remained the leading causal factor in mishaps in FY 2016.

In  FY  2016,  there  were  eleven  vehicle  Class  A  accidents  that resulted in twelve soldier fatalities, compared to seventeen in FY 2015, with  thirteen  fatalities.  Nine  of  the  FY  2016  fatalities  occurred  in one Army-vehicle mishap. There was also a 5 percent decline in the number of on-duty ground fatalities between FY 2015 and FY 2016, from twenty-one to twenty. Off-duty Class A incidents decreased by 2  percent,  from  eighty-three  in  FY  2015  to  eighty-one  in  FY  2016. In FY 2016, there were 12,161 Army civilian injury or illness claims, compared to 12,077 claims in FY 2015. In FY 2016, there was one Class A fatal accident involving an Army civilian employee, compared to two in FY 2015.

## Special Functions

## Surgeon General

The  Office  of  The  Surgeon  General  created  and  implemented Army-wide  directives  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2016  to  further  the primary  mission  of  improving  Army  medical  readiness.  One  such change was to simplify classification of soldiers to show whether or not they are deployable. Reasons for their nondeployability are made available to commanders in an online portal that shows how long it would take for their soldiers to become deployable. In another change, the  surgeon  general  issued  new  directives  that  standardized  Army physical training elements such as speed drills, warm-up exercises, and stretching routines in order to lower soldier training injuries and increase the medical readiness of the Army.

The  surgeon  general  also  implemented  the  TeleHealth  and Virtual  Health  programs  to  maintain  the  wellness  of  retirees, beneficiaries,  and  soldiers  outside  of  the  continental  United  States (OCONUS). Both programs made medical advice readily available to OCONUS locations and places in the continental United States not near a medical treatment facility. Currently more than thirty pilot programs in thirty separate countries allow health care providers to use TeleHealth services for patients anywhere in the world, including forward-deployed areas such as Afghanistan or Iraq. During FY 2016, 55,000  beneficiaries  received  care  through  these  online  services. Additionally, the Tricare Online Pharmacy Refill capability went live on 15 January 2016, and enabled 5,400 prescriptions to be refilled in February 2016 alone.

## Army Audit Agency

The U.S. Army Audit Agency (AAA) had 499 personnel organized into seventeen functional audit teams that provided internal auditing services for the Army. Personnel were located in seventeen offices, fourteen within the United States and three in OCONUS locations. The AAA published the Army's FY 2016 internal audit plan which assessed  Army-wide  programs  and  functions  to  discover  areas  of

monetary  waste  within  the  Army  budget.  Execution  of  the  plan produced 149 reports with $2.6  billion  in  potential  savings  for  the Army. In addition to the FY 2016 audit, AAA conducted seven followup audits of FY 2014 projects, and discovered $441 million in potential savings from FY 2014. By the end of FY 2016, the Army had realized $302 million in actual savings from the ongoing implementation of follow-up recommendations from the FY 2014 audit.

## Army National Military Cemeteries

The  Army  National  Military  Cemeteries  (ANMC)  advises  the secretary  of  the  Army  on  all  matters  related  to  Army  cemeteries. Its  goals  for  FY  2016  included  continuation  of  the  organizational cemetery  inspection  program  in  which  ANMC  sent  certified  and trained personnel to the Army's cemeteries to conduct formal, baseline inspections. Additionally, ANMC began three new projects: triennial review  inspections,  the  responsible-officials  training  program,  and the Native American-repatriation project at Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

The purpose of the triennial cemetery inspections is to prevent the misidentification  of  soldiers'  remains  and  other  problems  reported in  FY  2010  at  Arlington  National  Cemetery  (ANC).  The  triennial inspection  program  started  with  the  Main  Post  Cemetery  at  Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The inspection team presented a formal brief and conducted a thorough field and records-based appraisal using interview,  review,  and  observation  techniques.  The  also  reviewed random gravesites and records to confirm the accuracy of records information. The completed inspection products included the formal outbrief as well as a written report reviewed by the secretary of the Army and forwarded through the chain of command to the cemetery's responsible commander. The command of the inspected cemetery provided a corrective action plan outlining actions taken to remedy deficiencies. The inspections checked on the overall quality control efforts for cemetery records, and the corrective action plans improved the recordkeeping of the ANMC.

In FY 2016, the ANMC began a multiyear project to validate and approve excavation requests from Native American tribes and return Native American decedents to their respective tribes. This project began in response to two Native American tribes requesting repatriation of remains from the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery. Approximately 200 Native American students died while attending the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, which was once part of the current Carlisle Barracks. They were buried at the school's cemetery,

the  predecessor  of  the  Post  Cemetery.  This  ongoing  repatriation project  involves  a  coordinated  effort  between  AMNC  staff,  the Corps of Engineers, and Native American tribes.

During the year, ANC conducted 7,140 burials and there were four internments at the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery. The ANC also worked with the Corps of Engineers to expand burial space in ANC, as there is not enough space for continued burials in the cemetery through 2050. The Corps of Engineers and ANC also worked to upgrade the cemetery's workspaces and facilities, including installing  a  new  fire  suppression  system  in  the  visitors'  center  and repairing  the  ANC  amphitheater.  In  addition,  ANC  engineering completed  the  first  ever  survey  and  condition  assessment  of  250 government-owned historic structures at the cemetery.

The  cemetery  also  improved  its  customer-support  technology to  help  families  find  information  on  potential  burial  plots  and  the locations  of  loved  ones.  Changes  to  the  ANC  Web  site  improved navigation, aesthetics, and event management, and gave the public a place to submit online requests for services such as wreath-laying ceremonies and honor flights.

## Civil Works

The Corps of Engineers executes the Army's Civil Works Program. It maintains more than 900 coastal, Great Lakes', and inland harbors. In 2016, it created, restored, or preserved more than 6,000 acres of wetlands and provided storm damage protection and risk reduction for hundreds of miles of shoreline. The Corps of Engineers oversees approximately 14,000 of the nation's 100,000 miles of levees, and it operates approximately 650 dams and 238 navigation lock chambers on 12,000 miles of inland waterways. It was also the largest federal provider of outdoor recreation, with more than 4,300 recreation sites at Corps lakes and river projects.

In FY 2016, the Corps of Engineers worked on dozens of major projects and maintenance efforts. One of the most notable projects nearing  completion  was  the  Olmsted  Locks  on  the  Ohio  River  in Illinois. The project began in 1988 as an effort to replace aging locks and dams that were causing shipping delays. In FY 2016, $180 million was allocated to the Olmsted program and completion is expected no later than FY 2018. Another major program was the Columbia River fish mitigation effort, which received more than $80 million in funding. This effort seeks to allow salmon to reach spawning grounds despite the  network  of  eight  dams  along  the  Columbia  River.  In  northern California, the Corps of Engineers continued to modify the Folsom Dam as part of the project to remediate seepage along approximately twenty-two miles of the American River and to strengthen and raise twelve miles of Sacramento River levee in the Natomas area.

## Environmental Protection

Environmental protection programs are the responsibility of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy, and Environment) (OASA (IE&amp;E)). The office establishes policy and provides  strategic  direction  in  matters  relating  to  infrastructure, Army installations and contingency bases, energy, and environmental programs. In FY 2016, OASA (IE&amp;E) analyzed data for the Army's environmental  enforcement  actions  going  back  twenty-five  years. The analysis showed that over those years, the Army has managed to reduce the number of environmental enforcement actions to which it must respond by 80 percent.

The Army exceeded its potable water and industrial, landscaping, and  agricultural  water  conservation  goals  in  the  fiscal  year.  The FY 2016 potable water usage was 8.5 percent ahead of the FY 2016 target, and represented a 26.5 percent reduction from the FY 2007

baseline. The Army is also developing alternative sources for water, such  as  rainwater,  to  reduce  its  dependency  on  well  or  municipal water  sources.  Fort  Buchanan,  Puerto  Rico;  Fort  Riley,  Kansas; and  Joint  Base  Lewis-McChord,  Washington,  installed  rainwater harvesting  systems  as  part  of  their  net  zero  water  objectives.  Fort Buchanan  successfully  installed  rainwater  sites  on  nine  buildings and  is  currently  harvesting  1.2  million  gallons  of  water  annually, with a design capability of 1.8 million gallons per year. Additionally, Fort Carson, Colorado, reclaimed water from its onsite wastewater treatment plant.

In  FY 2016,  the  Army  increased  its  renewable  energy  capacity for  a  third  consecutive year. It added 92.6 megawatts of renewable energy  capacity  in  FY  2016  through  thirty-two  new  projects  for  a total of 252.5 megawatts, a 58.9 percent increase from the previous fiscal  year.  The  projects  included  the  installation  of  a  large  solar panel array at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and a biomass facility at Fort Drum, New York, to burn wood shavings and pulp from the nearby logging industry. A 216-acre solar facility opened at Fort Benning, Georgia, on 1 June 2016. The site features 133,950 solar panels, ideally

producing thirty megawatts, which is 17 percent of Fort Benning's overall energy need.

The  fifty-megawatt Schofield Generating  Station project at Schofield  Barracks,  Hawaii,  which  broke  ground  in  August  2016, will  be  the  only  power-generation  facility  in  Oahu  located  above the  tsunami-strike  zone.  It  will  run  on  a  mixture  of  biofuels  and conventional fuels and is expected to be operational by spring 2018. The plant will improve the resiliency of the entire island power grid by providing secure and flexible energy generation. During emergency operation, the Army will have first right to power for 100 percent of the operational requirements for Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Army Airfield, and Field Station Kunia for a minimum of thirty days.

## Legal

The Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (OTJAG) is  responsible  for  advising  Army  leadership  and  Congress  on  all significant issues pertaining to military justice. Table 10 shows the number and type of requests for legal information sent to OTJAG over the past three fiscal years.

The office's  key  efforts  for  FY  2016  focused  on  sexual  assault, reform  of  the  Uniformed  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  and

initiatives to ensure fair and equal justice for all soldiers in the military justice system. The OTJAG made defense counsel and special victim counseling (SVC) courses outside of the Army available to SVC judge advocates.  These  courses  taught  judge  advocates  how  to  interact, question,  and  listen  to  victims  of  sexual  assault.  The  office  made senior  leader  courses  focused  on  identifying  sexual  assault  victims available  to  judge  advocates  and  commanders  twice  annually.  In addition, OTJAG took steps to create a computer application to help child victims express the traumatic experience of sexual assault with judge advocates.

During the year, OTJAG completed its recommendations through the Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) for changes to the UCMJ. The MJRG was a staff-officer working group among all services that was directed by the secretary of  defense  to  discuss  changes  to  the UCMJ. The changes made by the MJRG were written into the Military Justice Act of 2016, and constituted the most important changes to the  UCMJ in more than thirty years. Significant changes included establishing prereferral authority for military judges, specifying the number of judges for courts-martial by level, overhauling all punitive articles, and extending the right of the accused in the appellate and review process.

During  FY  2016  there  were  956  courts-martial,  a  5.3  percent decrease  from  FY  2015,  but  this  involved  a  higher  number  of increasingly complex cases of sexual assault and other sex offenses ( Table 11 ). The rate of nonjudicial punishments imposed under Article 15 of the UCMJ also declined ( Table 12 ).

At  the  end  of  FY  2016,  the  military  attorney  strength  of  the active  Army  was  1,803.  That  number  does  not  include  sixty-nine officers  currently  attending  law  school  through  the  Army's  funded legal-education  program.  The  diverse  composition  of  the  active duty military attorney population in FY 2016 included 501 women, 117  African  Americans,  57  Hispanic  Americans,  and  104  Asian

Americans  and  Native  Americans.  At  the  end  of  FY  2016,  the military  attorney  strength  of  the  Army  Reserve  was  1,814  and  891 for the National Guard. At the end of the year, 267 attorneys were deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Cuba, Honduras, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Qatar, and other locations around the world.

## 10 Conclusion

As in the previous fiscal year, the Army accepted increased risk in  future  readiness  and  capabilities  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2016  in order to fund current requirements. In response to an ongoing high demand for the Army's unique capabilities, senior leaders continued to prioritize readiness at the expense of modernization. This priority enabled units from all three components to accomplish their assigned missions  in  deployments  at  home  and  overseas.  Although  far  fewer than earlier in this decade, casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan were a reminder that this was still an Army at war.

The service did make some progress toward the long term objectives laid out in the Army Vision. It took steps to enhance the quality of its noncommissioned officer corps and of recruit training. Changes in organization-such as establishment of the Rapid Capabilities Office and  further  integration  of  cyber  capabilities-and  in  force  structure improved the ability to respond to the challenges of an increasingly complex security  environment.  Although  in  general  agreement  with recommendations from the National Commission on the Future of the  Army,  the  service  remained  constrained  in  implementing  them given the funding levels. Although there were promising developments, resource constraints continued to slow the research, development, and acquisition activities necessary for full long-term modernization.

As  they  prepared  for  FY  2017,  senior  Army  leaders  concluded that  without  a  significant  increase  in  the  resources  provided,  the service would continue to face the same numerous, major challenges to meeting both its current requirements and achieving its long-term objectives.
