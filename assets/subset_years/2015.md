## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2015

## 1 Introduction

When  fiscal  year  (FY)  2015  opened,  the  Army  did  not  have an  approved  budget  and  operated  under  a  continuing  resolution. The  service  expected  that  the  year  would  bring  organizational  and personnel  turbulence  from  cuts  in  its  budget  and  its  authorized personnel strength. Although major combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  had  ended,  the  service  still  had  commitments  in  both countries.  At  the  same  time,  the  Army  would  have  to  maintain  its readiness for contingencies and modernize its materiel for large-scale combat operations.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

Organizational Changes

General Mark A. Milley assumed duty as the thirty-ninth Chief of Staff of the Army, on 14 August 2015, replacing General Raymond T. Odierno, who retired.

Headquarters,  Department  of  the  Army  (HQDA),  began  its transition to the FY 2019 Organization Design. A July 2013 secretary of  defense  directive  for  a  20  percent  reduction  in  the  Department of  Defense's  (DoD)  management  headquarters  spending  initiated this process. In July 2014, HQDA began a comprehensive review of its  organization,  to  include  associated  field  operating  agencies,  to determine the optimal size and structure of the headquarters within the constraints of projected budgets and overall Army end strength. The under secretary of the Army, in coordination with the vice chief of staff of the Army, oversaw the review, and the Office of Business Transformation and a contractor with expertise in large organizational headquarters design implemented it.

In  June  2015,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  approved  the  redesign recommended by the review, with HQDA's provisional reorganization no  later  than  the  end  of  FY  2016  as  a  preparatory  step,  with  full implementation no later than the beginning of FY 2019. Among the findings of the review were that numerous agencies had an excessive number of echelons between action officers and senior decision makers, and  that  too  many  managers  had  too  few  employees  to  manage. Guidance for  the  redesign  therefore  included  limiting  organizations to seven echelons and setting the ideal manager-to-employees ratio at one to eight. During FY 2016, these new designs will be implemented, along with the associated personnel reductions.

The secretary  of  the  Army  in  July  2015  approved  the  surgeon general's  request  to  reorganize  Medical  Command  (MEDCOM). In  2013,  a  Futures  Task  Force  had  been  established  to  review the  MEDCOM  structure;  it  recommended  a  flattened  and  more integrated  structure  geographically  aligned  to  support  operational forces. The  resulting reorganization will transform the fifteen existing  regional  functional  commands  into  four  multidisciplinary regional  health  commands  (RHC):  RHC-Pacific,  RHC-Central, RHC-Atlantic,  and  RHC-Europe.  The  RHCs  will  bring  together medical,  dental,  public  health,  and  veterinary  services  under  one general officer command, providing a single point of accountability for health readiness in the operational forces. Within the continental United States, RHC-Atlantic and RHC-Central will align primarily with XVIII Airborne Corps and III Corps installations, respectively. Overseas, RHC-Pacific will align with U.S. Army, Pacific, and RHCEurope will align with U.S. Army, Europe, and U.S. Army, Africa (USARAF). The headquarters elements of Dental Command, Public Health Command, and Warrior Transition Command will move to the MEDCOM headquarters as principal staff elements to improve health  readiness  integration,  synchronization,  and  oversight  at  the strategic level. MEDCOM initiated the reorganization immediately after approval by the secretary of the Army; three of the four new RHCs were operational by the end of the fiscal year and activation of RHC-Central is expected to occur in October 2015.

Since its establishment in 2006, the commander of the Installation Management  Command  (IMCOM)  had  been  HQDA's  assistant chief  of  staff  for  installation  management.  The  move  of  IMCOM headquarters from the National Capital Region to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, made this arrangement unwieldy by 2013. An analysis by the Office  of  the  Assistant  Chief  of  Staff  for  Installation  Management resulted in the creation of the IMCOM Task Force and the Installation Management  Task  Force  to  identify  the  issues  associated  with separating the two positions. In December 2014, the chief of staff of the Army decided to pursue a separate lieutenant general position for the  IMCOM commander. In June 2015, the secretary of the Army approved this separation and the new lieutenant general position, with IMCOM becoming a direct-reporting unit to the assistant secretary of the Army (installations, energy, and environment). The transition to this new arrangement will be completed during FY 2016.

The  deputy  secretary  of  defense  in  October  2014  directed  a study  into  the  operational  cost  of  the  Pentagon  Reservation.  One recommendation  of  the  study  was  that  information  technology (IT)  in  the  Pentagon  be  consolidated  under  a  Joint  Information Technology Single Service Provider (JITSSP), which would be a field service  agency  of  the  Defense  Information  Systems  Agency.  The resources and capabilities of the new organization would be provided by Washington Headquarters Services' Enterprise Information Technology  Directorate,  the  Joint  Staff's  IT  operations,  and  the Army's  Information  Technology  Agency  (ITA),  which  provides  IT services  for  many  other  DoD  organizations  within  the  National Capital Region. In May 2015, the deputy secretary of defense accepted this recommendation and directed its implementation in two phases. The  first  phase  of  the  transition  began  in  July  2015  when  JITSSP assumed operational control of ITA and the Enterprise Information Technology  Directorate.  Consolidation  of  common  or  shared  IT services within organizations of Office of the Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon and the National Capital Region will occur during this phase. The second phase will extend the consolidation to the military departments' headquarters in the Pentagon and their elements in the National Capital Region. The transition is expected to be complete by the end of FY 2016.

The secretary of the Army  in March  2015 approved the establishment of the Army University. Its purpose is to increase the academic rigor of the service's educational programs through broader accreditation,  greater  collaboration  with  civilian  universities  and colleges, and improved integration among the service's schools. The idea of the Army University dates back to 1949, but the broad geographic

dispersion of the service's schools and different institutional agendas prevented  the  development  of  a  university  structure.  Advances  in digital technology  and  distance  learning  now  enable  integrating Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) schools into a single educational structure modeled after successful state university systems, as well as the Air, Marine Corps, and National Defense Universities. All elements of officer, warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, and civilian education systems, both active and reserve components, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps precommissioning program will be included. The Army War College will retain its unique status as a direct-reporting unit to the chief of staff of the Army. At HQDA, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff G-3/5/7 will develop relevant policy  and  manage resources for the program, which is expected to reach full operational capability in June 2017.

The TRADOC commanding general will act as Army University chancellor and serve as the systemwide integrator, reporting directly to the chief of staff of the Army. The commanding general of the Combined Arms Center at Fort  Leavenworth,  Kansas,  will  act  as executive  vice  chancellor  for  training  and  education,  providing oversight  of  academic  quality,  support  programs,  finances,  future development  of  the  system,  and  public  representation  for  the university. The commandant of the Army War College will act as vice chancellor, advising the chancellor and the chief of staff of the Army on  matters  concerning  strategic  education.  The  Combined  Arms Center's deputy commanding general will act as provost, responsible for long-term continuity, and will also serve as manager of the Army Learning Coordination Council, which will synchronize education activities across the Army.

Realignment of the Institute of Heraldry began late in the fiscal year  and  will  become  effective  on  1  October  2015.  Previously,  the institute  had  reported  directly  to  the  Office  of  the  Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The change placed it under the U.S. Army Center of Military History. The rationale for this move included commonality of mission, as well as the fact that historical heraldry items, products, and services align closely under the center's mission areas and equities.

In  November  2014,  the  Army  established  the  Army  National Military Cemeteries (ANMC) as a secretariat element within HQDA. The executive director, ANMC, serves as the principal adviser to the secretary of the Army on all matters related to Army cemeteries and reports directly to the secretary. Also that month, the Army designated Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery as direct reporting units of the ANMC.

## Management

In  February  2015,  the  HQDA  chief  information  officer/deputy chief of staff, G-6 (CIO/G-6), published the Army Network Campaign Plan, which provides the direction for a modern network that optimizes operational effectiveness and increases information security while also increasing  efficiencies.  The  network  is  one  of  the  key  technological focus areas described in the Army Operating Concept. The plan has five goals. First, align signals capabilities to support all Army missions. Second, boost cybersecurity capabilities, in part by establishing a series of  cyberprotection  teams.  Third,  strengthen  the  Army's  underlying IT infrastructure. Fourth, make better use of IT at the edge of Army networks by using tools such as data consolidation. Fifth, strengthen network operations by, for example, 'flattening' the IT architecture to give network operators greater visibility.

The following month, the CIO/G-6 published Army Cloud Computing Strategy .  It  sets  out how cloud-enabled network capabilities will improve mission and business effectiveness, increase operational IT efficiencies, and protect the service's data and IT infrastructure. It extended the concepts defined in various federal government policies and nests within the Army Network Campaign Plan. The elements in this strategy include common standards; enabling resilience; cybersecurity; lowering IT costs; continuation of service under disconnected, intermittent,  or  low-bandwidth  conditions;  minimizing  redundant data  sources;  and  compliance  with  Army  Information  Architecture data standards. The G-6 will update the strategy periodically to reflect the standards, polices, and lessons learned during implementation.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2010 established the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative to reduce the cost of  data  center  operations,  increase  the  federal  government's  overall IT  security,  and  shift  IT  investments  to  more  efficient  computing platforms. The initiative directed federal agencies to close 40 percent of their data centers by the end of FY 2015. To comply with this directive, HQDA established  the  Army  Data  Center  Consolidation  Program. Initially, OMB had defined a data center as any room larger than 500 square feet devoted to data processing. In March 2012, however, OMB realized  that  data  center  facilities  smaller  than  500  square  feet  also consumed  significant  resources  and  directed  that  these  be  included in  the  consolidation  effort.  Using  the  revised  definition,  the  Army identified 1,162 data centers across the service. Between FY 2011 and the end of FY 2015, the Army did not meet the goal of a 40 percent reduction; it reached 30 percent by closing 352 centers. The shortfall occurred principally in FY 2015, when only 71 out of 130 targeted

data centers closed. Most of the centers closed before FY 2015 were small ones with five or fewer servers. Organizations were more resistant to  closing  larger  centers,  especially  because  the  Army  Data  Center Consolidation Program has been underfunded. The HQDA CIO/G-6 expects to make up the shortfall during FY 2016 with more stringent oversight of the program.

The  Army  continued  working  with  the  Defense  Information Systems Agency  on implementation of network modernization programs. During FY 2015, the service modernized fourteen installations by replacing one gigabit-per-second capabilities with ten gigabit-per-second campus-area switches. The Army delivered greater fiber-optic  capacity  and  multiprotocol  label-switching  routing  to twenty-four installations.

Over the past decade, the Army has invested heavily in standing up enterprise-wide cost-management capabilities within the General Fund  Enterprise  Business  System  and  other  related  enterprise, resource,  and  planning  systems.  To  take  full  advantage  of  these systems  for  better  cost  planning,  analysis,  and  control,  the  Army established  a  cost-management  steering  group  in  October  2014. General officers and Senior Executive Service members comprise the group and the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for cost and economics chairs it.

Progress continued toward the goal of auditable financial statements. Congress mandated in the FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act  that  the  DoD  must  develop  a  plan  for  correcting  its  financial management  deficiencies  and  ensure  that  its  financial  statements  are ready for audit by 30 September 2017. In FY 2014, the Army asserted audit readiness on its General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity. The General Fund Schedule of Budgetary Activity for FY 2015 included financial transactions directly related to appropriations received by the service in FY 2015, but did not include financial transactions related to appropriations received in prior fiscal years. In December 2014, the Army contracted with an independent public accounting firm to conduct the audit, which will be completed early in FY 2016.

In  July  2015,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  revised  the  service's conference management policy. Implementation of the policy since its issuance in December 2013 had demonstrated the need for increased delegation  of  approval  authorities.  The  revision  also  ended  the cumbersome requirement for a postevent quantitative and qualitative assessment as it provided fewer benefits than anticipated. Instead, only conferences approved by a tier one or tier two official now require a qualitative after-action report; conferences approved by a tier three or tier four official only require submission of actual cost and attendance

data, and a justification if the actual cost varied from the estimate by more than 10 percent. A new requirement was the mandatory use of the Army Conference Reporting and Tracking Tool to submit conference requests beginning 1 October 2015.

The Army published a major revision of Army Regulation 1-100: The Army Gift Program in  July  2015. This revision, the first in thirty-two years, also superseded Army Regulation 1-101: Gifts for Distribution to Individuals . A new Army Regulation 1-100 is part of HQDA's effort to standardize the acceptance, recording, reporting, and accountability of gifts accepted under Title 10, United States Code ,  for  the  benefit of various organizations and activities across the Department of the Army. For this reason, this revision also superseded Army Regulation 1-101 because it had included an extrastatutory authority to certain commanders.

The  Army's  small  business  program  seeks  to  expand  the  small business industrial base relevant to the service's needs and leverage the use of minority-serving educational institutions in support of Army science and technology programs. In FY 2015, the Army awarded over $17.6  billion  in  prime  contracts  to  small  business  firms.  The  Army exceeded all DoD-assigned socioeconomic small business goals for the fiscal year.

## Budget

For the sixth consecutive year, the Army began its fiscal year without an  approved  budget,  operating  instead  on  a  continuing  resolution, which appropriated amounts for FY 2015 operations under the same conditions and at the same rates as in FY 2014. Under the resolution, no new multiyear procurements utilizing advance procurement funding could be initiated. It limited military construction to planning and design, unspecified minor military construction, ongoing projects already  authorized,  and  the  Army  Family  Housing  program.  In early November, the president sent Congress a request for additional operational contingency operations funding in FY 2015. The Army would  receive  about  $2.5  billion;  62  percent  of  this  amount  would go to training and equipping Iraqi forces. Congress finally passed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 in December ( Tables 1-4 ), and on 19 December the president signed it into law.

FY  2015  was  a  challenging  year  as  Congress  appropriated $5.1 billion less for the base budget than what the service actually spent in FY 2014, even though the demand for Army forces around the world did not decrease. Uncertainty of funding levels and budget distribution time lines created challenges throughout the year, as Army leaders at all

levels faced greater difficulty in planning and executing their programs. The fiscal  year  ended  with  personnel  accounts  at  99  to  100  percent obligated.  The  Army  executed  its  three  base  budget  operation  and maintenance appropriations,  less  $212  million,  a  majority  of  which were credits from favorable foreign currency fluctuations.

The  Army  executed  its  expiring-year  FY  2013  procurement program at 99.4 percent, leaving only $107 million unobligated. The primary  reason  for  this  amount  was  lower-than-expected  contract closeout costs from the Kiowa Warrior program. The expiring-year FY 2014/2015 research,  development,  test,  and  evaluation  program reached 99.6 percent obligated and 81.7 percent disbursed. The Army retained  the  remaining  funds  to  finance  contract  adjustments.  The FY  2015  execution  rate  for  Army  family  housing  operations  was 99.7 percent. Of the 229 FY 2011/2015 military construction projects, the Army awarded 228. The remaining project, for land acquisition at Fort Benning, Georgia, was not required.

Reduced funding levels and improved management and execution of accounts left the Army with significantly fewer sources from which to reprogram funds than in prior years. Reprogramming funds requiring congressional  approval  totaled  $4.44  billion,  a  27  percent  decrease from FY 2014. The service reprogrammed an additional $3.22 billion for actions below the thresholds that require congressional approval. The service funded a total of $2.5 billion in unfinanced requirements with money  taken  from  operations  and  maintenance  accounts. Programs  funded  through  reprogramming  include  base  operations support  ($916  million);  sustainment  modernization  and  restoration ($222.7  million);  Army  marketing  ($120  million);  Kosovo  Force, Balkans ($40.8 million); Site G ($43.8 million); and IT services and support ($245.7 million).

During testimony before congressional committees in 2015, senior Army leaders warned that the service's readiness would be threatened if its funding were to be cut below the amount it requested for its FY 2016 budget. If sequestration budget cuts were implemented in FY 2016, by FY 2020 the Army would have to cut its active strength by 70,000 soldiers, its National Guard strength by 35,000, and its Army Reserve strength by 10,000. These personnel cuts would include the involuntary separation of about 14,000 officers and noncommissioned officers. Such reductions in personnel would then trigger the inactivation of between ten and twelve brigade combat teams (BCTs). Additionally,  sequestration  would  require  significant  reductions  in funding for training and materiel modernization ( Tables 5-6 ).

For the seventh consecutive year, the Army ended its fiscal year without  an  approved  budget  for  the  next  one.  On  28  September,

HQDA issued a planning order for operations in FY 2016 without appropriations.  The  order  included  a  list  of  those  missions  and activities which would continue during a government shutdown and guidance  on  how  to  suspend  all  other  missions  and  activities  until appropriations became available. Congress approved and the president signed a continuing resolution on 30 September, the last day of FY 2015, thereby obviating the need to implement these measures.

## Officers

In FY 2015, Human Resources Command organized four active component  officer  force-shaping  boards.  The  boards  convened  to meet  congressionally  mandated  end-strength  reductions  and  to reduce  overpopulated  branches  and  areas  of  concentration.  The Colonel  Army  Competitive  Category  Selective  Early  Retirement Board  considered  565  officers  and  selected  142.  The  Lieutenant Colonel  Army  Competitive  Category  Selective  Early  Retirement Board considered 547 officers and selected 151. The Captain Army Competitive  Category  Officer  Selection  Board/Enhanced  Selective Early Retirement Board considered 3,433 officers and selected 500. The  Captain  Army  Medical  Department  Officer  Selection  Board/ Enhanced Selective Early Retirement Board considered 883 officers and selected 241.

In  January  2015,  the  Army  ended  the  policy  of  masking  junior officer  evaluation  reports.  Under  this  policy,  selection  boards  could not view these reports once an officer was promoted to captain or chief warrant officer 3. In addition to ending the masking policy, Human Resources  Command  moved  previously  masked  evaluation  reports to  the  performance  section  of  officers'  personnel  files.  This  change occurred as the secretary of the Army directed selection boards to move from the 'fully qualified' to the 'best qualified' criteria. Unmasking junior  officer  evaluation  reports  will  provide  selection  boards  with evidence justifying not selecting officers under the new criteria.

In  October  2014,  the  Army  launched  the  Commander  360 program, a new assessment for battalion and brigade commanders in which they receive feedback from leaders, peers, and subordinates throughout their organization. It is a leader development program within the Army's Multi-Source Assessment and Feedback suite of tools.  The  Army  pilot-tested  Commander  360  from  April  to  July 2013 and received favorable reviews from participating commanders and raters.  Following  the  pilot,  it  used  twenty-four  Regular  Army commanders to test the final version of the program in spring and summer  2014.  The  multisource  feedback  produces  useful  insights

about commanders that they and their raters are not likely to come by  on  their  own.  Only  the  commanders  and  their  current  raters have  access  to  the  feedback.  The  Army  designed  the  program  for Centralized  Selection List lieutenant colonels and  colonels. It focuses  on  battalion-  and  brigade-level  commanders  because  they have  a  critical  role  as  organizational  leaders.  The  Army  requires approximately 1,200 Centralized Selection List-level Regular Army commanders to participate in two Commander 360 events during the course of their command tenure, the first within three to six months of assuming command and the second between fifteen to eighteen months  of  command.  The  Army  plans  to  extend  the  program  to nearly 2,400 reserve component commanders in October 2015.

A new edition of Department of the Army Pamphlet 600-3, Officer Professional Development  and  Career  Management , published  in December 2014, adjusted the branch and functional-area makeup of the three functional categories. It also renamed the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects functional category to the Operations category. The new alignment places eleven branches and one functional area, Information Operations, in the Operations category. The Army moved the Public Affairs functional area from the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects category to  the  Operations  Support  category,  which  contains  two  branches and twelve other functional areas, including a new electronic warfare specialty.  The  third  functional  category,  Force  Sustainment,  has  six branches and the Army Acquisition Corps functional area. The revision introduced a new competitive, intermediate-level, education-selection process. Starting with Year Group 2004, merit-based selection boards will be conducted in conjunction with promotion to major selection. They will consider Army Competitive Category officers for attending intermediate-level  education,  regardless  of  component  or  branch, on  a  best-qualified  basis.  There  are  three  options  for  completing intermediate-level education: a ten-month resident course, a fourteenweek satellite campus course, and a distance education course.

In August  2015, Army  Directive 2015-30  revised policy on professional military education, leader development, and talent management for warrant officers. It required completion of professional military  education  as  a  prerequisite  for  capstone  and  key  warrant officer  assignments.  Among  the  assignments  affected  by  this  change are command at any level; professional military education instructors; HQDA  centralized  selection  boards;  Human  Resources  Command career managers;  broadening  assignments;  and  joint,  interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational positions. The new policy applies to all three Army components and will be included in the next revision of Army Regulation 350-1: Army Training and Leader Development .

## Enlisted

The Regular Army exceeded its recruiting goal of 59,000 for FY 2015 by 170 persons. Of those recruited, 58,162 had no prior military service. Women comprised 17 percent of the non-prior service recruits, the same percentage as in FY 2014. The service's goal is that no less than 90 percent of non-prior service enlistees will be a high school graduate. In FY 2015, high school graduates comprised 98 percent of non-prior service accessions, a figure that was 11 percent higher than in the previous year.

Both reserve components fell short of their recruiting objectives. The Army National Guard's objective was 43,250; it accessioned 38,430 enlistees.  The  Army  Reserve's  objective  was  17,313;  it  accessioned 14,971 enlistees. An improving economy and budget constraints that limited enlistment bonuses were the principal causes of these shortfalls.

In  FY  2015,  the  Regular  Army  reenlisted  50,083  soldiers.  The Army National Guard reenlisted 35,713 soldiers. The Army Reserve reenlisted 16,102 soldiers.

During FY 2015, the Army continued to use 'Precision Retention' as part of its plan to meet congressionally mandated end strength. This concept tailored retention to ensure personnel needs are met in specific military occupational specialties (MOSs). Under Precision Retention, commanders  have  the  authority  to  reenlist  a  specific  number  of soldiers serving in critical over-strength MOSs and skill levels. Soldiers not selected for retention in their specialty were reclassified, assigned to  a  location  that  is  critically  short  in  their  current  MOS,  or  not permitted to reenlist. Precision Retention allowed the Army to monitor retention requirements and notify commands when the Army neared its  maximum-retention  thresholds.  The  Army  encouraged  soldiers who could not remain on active duty under Precision Retention to transition  to  the  reserve  components  wherever  their  skills  matched existing and projected requirements.

Human Resources Command conducted four Qualitative Service Program selection boards and three Qualitative Management Program selection boards as part of the Army's efforts to achieve congressionally mandated end strength and to reduce overpopulated MOSs. The Qualitative Service Program boards selected more than 325 Regular Army and Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) noncommissioned officers in pay grades E-7, E-8, and E-9 for involuntary separation. Of the 5,241 Regular Army and AGR noncommissioned officers in pay grades E-6 through E-9 considered for separation by Qualitative Management Program boards, 286 were determined ineligible, 1,233 elected to voluntarily retire, and 111 were deferred to later boards.

Of those boarded, the Army retained 1,931 and separated 1,688 from active service.

In  July  2015,  the  chief  of  staff  of  the  Army  approved  the implementation of the Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development System. The objective of the system is the creation of an  adaptable  and  resilient  noncommissioned  officer  corps  capable of training and leading soldiers in uncertain and complex operating environments. TRADOC will develop and publish a Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development System strategy by the end of the first quarter of FY 2016.

At the same time, the chief of staff of the Army approved three supporting initiatives for the Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development System: renaming the Warrior Leader Course as the Basic Leader Course; adding a Master Leader Course for noncommissioned officers in the grade of E-8 to bridge the formal education gap between the  E-7  and  E-9  grades;  and  updating  Noncommissioned  Officer Education System deferment policies. These changes applied to soldiers in  all  three  components.  The  Master  Leader  Course  will  educate noncommissioned  officers  in  professional  writing,  communication, public speaking, and management. Pilot classes for the course will be begin in FY 2016.

The  development  of  an  agile  and  adaptive  noncommissioned officer requires  an  investment  in  professional  military  education through a deliberate, continuous, and progressive lifelong process. To improve  that  process,  Army  Directive  2015-31  established  a  SelectTrain-Educate-Promote policy in August 2015. This policy revises how the  Army will promote enlisted soldiers in all three components by linking structured self-development and the Noncommissioned Officer Education  System  to  subsequent  promotion.  Effective  1  January 2016, soldiers must graduate from the professional military education program for their position before they can be eligible to pin on their new rank. Promotion to sergeant will require completion of the Basic Leader Course. Promotion to staff sergeant will require completion of the Advanced Leader Course. Promotion to sergeant first class will require completion of the Senior Leader Course.

## Civilian Personnel

At  the  end  of  FY  2015,  there  were  250,134  U.S.  direct-hire civilian  employees  and  21,660  foreign  national  civilian  employees paid  from  appropriated  funds.  There  were  also  27,736  paid  from nonappropriated  funds  and  22,938  civil  works  civilian  employees. The Army civilian workforce in FY 2015 had an average age of 47.7.

More than 20 percent of the workforce is age 55 or older whereas only 16 percent is under 35. A third of the workforce is currently at or near retirement age.

Since  2011,  the  Army  has,  commensurate  with  military  end strength reductions, undertaken  efforts to draw  down  civilian employee strength from its high of 285,000 during Operations IraqI Freedom and endurIng Freedom . The objective is to reach 239,500 full-time  equivalents  by  the  end  of  FY  2017.  The  total  civilian workforce declined by 0.9 percent in FY 2015. The Army is working to achieve planned reductions in a responsible way by prioritizing the use of attrition and Voluntary Early Retirement Authority/Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments.

## Special Topics

An Army War College study published in February 2015, Lying to Ourselves: Dishonesty in the Army Profession ,  found that the Army's increasing  number of mandatory training requirements had created an environment where it is impossible to execute all of them to the required standard. At the same time, reporting noncompliance with the requirements is seldom a viable option. As a result, the conditions are  set  where  subordinates  and  units  often  are  forced  to  determine which requirements will actually be done to standard and which will only be reported as done to standard. After repeated exposure to the overwhelming demands and the associated need to put their honor on the line to verify compliance, many Army officers have become ethically numb. As a result, an officer's signature and word have become tools to maneuver through the Army bureaucracy rather than being symbols of integrity and honesty.

In  March  2015,  the  sergeant  major  of  the  Army  announced the  'Not  In  My  Squad'  initiative  as  part  of  the  service's  efforts  to prevent  sexual  harassment  and  sexual  assault.  It  highlights  the  role of  noncommissioned  officers  in  this  effort  by  fostering  discussions about how junior noncommissioned officers can build and sustain a climate of dignity, respect, trust, and inclusion in their units. In June, the sergeant major of the Army conducted a workshop with a diverse group of thirty-two squad leaders from the service's major commands and the three components. The squad leaders identified best practices for  building  and  maintaining  a  positive  climate  at  the  squad  level. They also identified challenges they commonly face in this area, which include  a  lack  of  resources;  too  much  online  training  (which  they believe squad leaders could better present to soldiers); and too many last-minute,  'no  failure'  taskings.  The  workshop  will  be  replicated

across the Army during the next year to gather additional feedback and recommendations.

The secretary of defense in January 2013 rescinded the 1994 Direct Ground  Combat  Definition  and  Assignment  Rule.  He  directed  the military services and U.S. Special Operations Command to validate all  occupational  standards  to  ensure  they  are  occupationally  and operationally relevant, to complete all studies by autumn 2015, and either to ensure full implementation by 1 January 2016 or submit an exception  to  policy  request.  The  Army  responded  to  this  directive with the Soldier 2020 program. It examined institutional and cultural factors associated with gender integration. It also studied the physical demands  in  combat  arms  MOSs  to  develop  standards  that  would ensure  that  soldiers  physically  qualified  for  the  positions  fill  them. These studies led to the opening of the 12B combat engineer and 13B and 13D artillery specialties  and  the  Ranger  School  to  women.  On 30 September 2015, the Army recommended opening all MOSs that remained closed to women.

The Army in April 2015 revised its policy on tattoos. It no longer limits soldiers to a particular size or number of tattoos permitted on the arms or legs, provided those tattoos are not extremist, indecent, sexist, or racist. The policy, however, continues to prohibit tattoos above the T-shirt  neckline  (on  the  neck,  face,  and  head)  or  on  the  wrists  and hands. There is an exception allowing one ring tattoo on each hand.

Implementation of the Enterprise Army Brand national marketing strategy began in November 2014. This strategy is a shift in the Army's marketing  approach.  The  Enterprise  Army  Brand  emphasizes  the service's value to the nation as an institution rather than its value for the individual. The reason for this change was a declining propensity for service in the military, a shrinking  population  of  qualified applicants, and an increasingly favorable economy. These factors had made recruiting more difficult, as did a negative image of the Army created by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Enterprise Army Brand shows the service as the nation's most versatile force, with the scale and scope to adapt to challenges that arise both at home and abroad. It depicts who is in the Army, what they do, and why they have made the commitment to serve the nation.

During the fiscal year, the Army made significant gains in youth perceptions in important career value areas, as measured by the annual Joint  Advertising  Marketing  and  Research  Studies  program.  These shifts in perceptions were significant and the first such reported gains since 2012. Monthly visits to the goarmy.com website increased from 1.6 million in the first quarter of the fiscal year to 3 million by the end of the fiscal year.

Work  continued  on  the  Integrated  Personnel  and  Pay  SystemArmy (IPPS-A). The Army designed the system to end reliance on more  than  forty  stovepiped  systems  that  do  not  efficiently  share information with one another. Once implemented, IPPS-A will provide a web-based tool accessible to soldiers, human resources professionals, and  other  authorized  users.  The  system  will  provide  a  centralized resource to better manage personnel and pay information for all three components. In November 2014, the Army completed deployment of IPPS-A Increment I. This increment provides a Soldier Record Brief accessible through a web interface that can be printed out, but it does not provide the ability to add or edit personnel data. That ability will be  phased in during the four releases in Increment II. The Defense Acquisition Board in December 2014 approved the Milestone B for the IPPS-A Increment II. This decision authorized the system to enter the  development  and  fielding  phase  for  Increment  II.  In  July  2015, the Army acquisition executive signed the full deployment acquisition decision memorandum for IPPS-A.

Human Resources Command administered $229 million of tuition assistance funding to 113,888 soldiers in support of 366,290 education courses  during  this  fiscal  year.  Using  this  tuition  assistance,  active component soldiers earned 12,036 academic degrees, Army National Guard  soldiers  earned  2,162  academic  degrees,  and  Army  Reserve soldiers earned 2,042 academic degrees.

## Medal of Honor

In November 2014, President Barack H. Obama posthumously awarded 1st Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing the Medal of Honor for his actions near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, while commanding Battery A, 4th Regiment of Artillery, on 3 July 1863. On the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Lieutenant Cushing's battery was positioned on Cemetery Ridge. The enemy began an artillery bombardment of the American position in preparation for a major infantry assault. Within a few hours, all  of  Cushing's  officers  had  been  killed,  all but two of his guns had been silenced, and he had been severely wounded.  Refusing  to  leave  his  battery,  Cushing  directed  the operation of his remaining guns as the enemy's infantry assaulted the  American position. When the enemy was less than 100 yards from his position, Cushing was shot in the head and killed, but the fire  of   his  battery  had  played  an  important  part  in  defeating  the enemy attack.

In June 2015, two soldiers who served during World War I had their Distinguished Service Cross award upgraded to a Medal of Honor.

President Obama posthumously awards the Medal of Honor to 1st Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing, accepted on his behalf by his first cousin twice removed, Helen Loring Ensign, 6 November 2014.



President Obama posthumously awards the Medal of Honor to Sgt. Henry Johnson, accepted on his behalf by Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard, 2 June 2015.



President Obama posthumously awards the Medal of Honor to Sgt. William Shemin, accepted on his behalf by his daughters, Elsie Shemin-Roth and Ina Bass, 2 June 2015.



President  Obama  posthumously  awarded  Pvt.  Henry  Johnson the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Argonne Forest, France, as  a  member  of  Company  C,  369th  Infantry,  93d  Division,  on  15 May 1918. In the early morning hours, Private Johnson and another soldier were at a forward outpost when a German raiding party of at least  twelve  men  attacked  them.  Although under intense enemy fire and despite receiving significant wounds, Johnson killed or wounded several  of  the  Germans.  When  the  enemy  badly  wounded  a  fellow soldier  and  began  carrying  him  away,  Private  Johnson  engaged  two enemy captors in hand-to-hand combat. Wielding only a knife and gravely  wounded  himself,  Johnson  continued  fighting,  defeating  the two Germans and rescuing the wounded soldier. He continued to hold back the larger enemy force until it retreated, leaving behind a large cache of weapons and equipment that provided valuable intelligence. Although Johnson became one of the first Americans to be awarded the French Croix de Guerre avec Palme, France's highest award for valor, the 369th Infantry Regiment was an African American unit of the New York National Guard and the racially segregated U.S. Army did  not  recognize  his  valor  during  the  war.  Johnson,  who  died  in 1929, was awarded posthumously the Purple Heart in 1996 and the Distinguished Service Cross in 2002.

In June 2015, the president posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to Sgt. William Shemin for his actions near Bazoches, France, as  a  member  of  Company  G,  47th  Infantry,  4th  Division,  from  7 August  to  9  August  1918.  Sergeant  Shemin  left  cover  and  crossed open space,  repeatedly  exposing  himself  to  heavy  machine-gun  and rifle  fire,  to  rescue  wounded  soldiers.  After  the  officers  and  senior noncommissioned  officers  had  become  casualties,  Sergeant  Shemin took command of his platoon and displayed great initiative under fire until wounded on 9 August. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in December 1919. Shemin died in 1973.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

## Readiness

To offset sequestration's impact on FY 2014 readiness, the Army in FY 2015 implemented a tiered readiness plan. Six of the Regular Army's  thirty-two  BCTs,  along  with  one  combat  aviation  brigade, comprised  the  Army  Contingency  Force.  This  force  ensured  that  a portion of the service's force structure remained ready and available for immediate deployment. These units received the resources necessary to reach  a  full  state  of  readiness,  to  include  equipment  modernization and a rotation at a combat training center. However, these units had to curtail some necessary home station training to conserve resources for combat training center rotations. They then arrived for their rotation not  fully  ready  for  these  complex  training  scenarios,  and  therefore unable to derive the full  benefit  of  the  training.  Units  not  assigned to the Army Contingency Force received resources sufficient to reach readiness requirements at only the company level.

The Army Strategic Readiness Assessment Process is a quarterly comprehensive  analysis  of  the  Army's  strategic  readiness  across the  total  force.  This  assessment  combines  objective,  subjective, quantitative, qualitative, and empirical measures to portray a holistic view of current and projected strategic readiness. In June 2015, the Army published Department  of  the  Army  Pamphlet  525-30:  Army Strategic  Readiness  Assessment  Procedures .  This  new  publication implements strategic readiness assessment procedures and processes per Army  Regulation 525-30: Army  Strategic Readiness. The pamphlet explains the strategic readiness assessment processes and general reporting procedures.

In September 2015, the Army published the Sustainable Readiness  Model.  Readiness  models  are  used  to  monitor  and  plan the  forces  that  can  be  made  available  to  combatant  commands  for operations. Sustainable readiness will replace Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN),  a  model  designed  primarily  to  generate  units  for meeting predictable deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army

now,  however,  is  expected  to  execute  a  multitude  of  highly  diverse overseas missions.

Sustainable readiness extends the planning timeline by analyzing the  Army's  ability  to  meet  global  requirements  four  years  into  the future. The previous ARFORGEN model considered a narrower scope of requirements and looked only two years in advance of the execution phase. The Army also designed sustainable readiness to ensure that high operational tempo, such as those in civil affairs, combat aviation, and military intelligence, can be tracked in a more detailed manner, compared  to the BCT-centric model of ARFORGEN.  Unlike ARFORGEN, there are no fixed progressive cycles for Regular Army units, but reserve component units will remain on a five-year cycle.

Instead of the ARFORGEN three-stage cycle of reset-train-deploy, sustainable readiness will be less mechanistic and create more detailed forecasts of unit readiness as measured against anticipated demands on a quarterly basis through the first two years of each Future Year Defense Program. This analysis provides a method for synchronizing Army activities and resources by indicating whether a unit is preparing to assume a mission, ready for a mission, or already assigned a mission. These readiness states provide the basis for the three descriptive threemonth modules (Prepare, Ready, and Mission) used as the organizing construct for the Sustainable Readiness Model. Within the 'Prepare' module, commanders will train their units to complete the full range of  military  operations.  Units  in  the  'Ready'  module  will  prepare for  deployment at  any  time.  Units  in  the  'Mission'  module  will  be prepared for a variety of tasks but focused to accomplish a specific mission. The Army will implement the Sustainable Readiness Model in FY 2017.

## Doctrine and Future Force

In October  2014, the Army  published TRADOC  Pamphlet 525-3-1: The Army Operating Concept: Win in a Complex World .  It describes how future Army forces will prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars while operating as part of the joint force and  working  with  multiple  partners.  The  concept  will  guide  future force development by identifying first-order capabilities that the service needs  to  support  U.S.  policy  objectives.  It  provides  the  intellectual foundation and framework for future force development under Force 2025 and Beyond.

This concept focuses on  all three levels of war-tactical, operational, and  strategic-and  defines  winning  as  more  than simply defeating threat forces. It means meeting national goals and

objectives that are unique for each operation through the application of  all  elements  of  national  power.  The  concept  defines  'complex' as an environment that is not only unknown, but also unknowable and constantly changing. To win in this environment, the Army must provide the joint force with multiple options, integrate the efforts of multiple partners, operate across multiple domains, and present our adversaries with multiple dilemmas.

The  Center  for  the  Army  Profession  and  Ethic  in  June  2015 released  the  second  edition  of Army Doctrine Reference Publication 1: The Army Profession .  This revision added a chapter defining and discussing the Army ethic. The first edition, published in June 2013, had only briefly mentioned the topic. The Army ethic guides soldiers and civilian employees in making decisions and taking actions in the performance of their duties. The Army ethic is expressed in law, Army values, creeds, oaths, ethos, and shared beliefs embedded within Army culture.

## Force Structure

The  drawdown  in  the  Regular  Army's  authorized  personnel strength required the service to continue a reduction in force structure begun the previous year. During FY 2015, the Army inactivated six BCTs: 4th BCT, 1st Infantry Division; 1st BCT, 2d Infantry Division; 2d  BCT,  3d  Infantry  Division;  2d  BCT,  4th  Infantry  Division;  3d BCT, 10th Mountain Division; and 3d BCT, 1st Armored Division. These  inactivations  left  the  Regular  Army  with  thirty-two  BCTs. To  provide  the  2d  Infantry  Division  with  an  American  maneuver brigade following inactivation of its 2d BCT, the Army in 2015 began deploying an armored BCT from the United States to Korea on a ninemonth tour. In July 2015, the Army announced that budget constraints would require it to inactivate an additional two BCTs by FY 2017: 3d BCT, 3d Infantry Division, and 4th BCT, 25th Infantry Division. Additionally, the 2d BCT, 25th Infantry Division, will convert from a Stryker brigade to a two-maneuver battalion infantry BCT.

The  implementation  of  the  Budget  Control  Act's  sequestration provisions in 2013 made the Army's aviation structure unaffordable. In response, HQDA created the Aviation Restructure Initiative to retain as many of its most capable aircraft as affordable. The initiative will also maximize capacity for meeting combatant command requirements by placing all attack helicopters in the Regular Army and focusing Army National Guard units on the lift and medevac missions. The secretary of  defense  approved  the  initiative  in  2014.  By  the  time  the  Army completes it in FY 2019, the initiative will have eliminated nearly 700

aircraft and three combat aviation brigades from the Regular Army and 111 aircraft from the reserve components. All TH-67 initial pilot training  aircraft  will  be  retired.  All  OH-58A/C  training  and  utility aircraft  will  be  retired.  All  OH-58D reconnaissance helicopters will be retired. All AH-64 attack helicopters in the Army National Guard will  be  transferred  to  the  Regular  Army  to  replace  the  OH-58Ds. Then, one AH-64-equipped attack reconnaissance battalion in each Regular Army combat aviation brigade will convert to a heavy attack reconnaissance squadron design; this design will include RQ-7 Shadow drones for the capabilities OH-58Ds previously provided. Additional UH-60s will be transferred to the Army National Guard to increase the number of lift units. One hundred UH-72s will be procured for the training mission.

During  FY  2015,  the  Army  completed  several  parts  of  the Aviation Restructure Initiative. It retired 273 OH-58s. It transferred twenty-four  AH-64D  attack  helicopters  from  the  Army  National Guard to the Regular Army's 1st Battalion, 6th Aviation Regiment, at Fort Riley, Kansas. It inactivated three Regular Army combat aviation brigades and activated an attack reconnaissance battalion in Alaska. It transferred thirty-two UH-72 helicopters to the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and the center began the first class of initial-entry rotary-wing training in this aircraft. Three Regular Army air cavalry squadrons converted to heavy attack reconnaissance squadrons.

Congress established the National Commission on the Future of the Army in the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act because of  two  concerns.  The  first  was  how  the  Army  should  best  organize and employ its three components in a time of declining resources. The second was whether the service should proceed with the transfer of AH-64 aircraft from the Army National Guard to the Regular Army, as directed by the Aviation Restructure Initiative. Congress directed the  commission to undertake a comprehensive study of the Army's structure to assess the size and force mix of the Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve, and to make recommendations in those areas where the commission thought appropriate. In considering recommendations, the commission is to take into account anticipated mission  requirements  for  the  Army  at  acceptable  levels  of  national risk in a manner consistent with available resources and anticipated future resources. Additionally,  Congress  specifically directed the commission to study the transfer of all the Army National Guard's AH-64 helicopters to the Regular Army. The commission's report is due by 1 February 2016.

In December 2014, the secretary of the Army  assigned responsibility for integrating and synchronizing the Army's support

of the commission to the HQDA deputy chief of staff G-8's Army Quadrennial  Defense  Review  Office.  The  office  will  identify  likely issues to be addressed by the commission and prepare appropriate background papers, briefings, and analysis for the commission. The secretary gave the office full tasking authority across the Army for this effort.

In October 2014, the Army began reorganizing and redesignating its battlefield surveillance brigades as expeditionary military intelligence  brigades.  The  major  change  is  that  the  expeditionary military intelligence brigade will not have an organic cavalry squadron with  which  to  conduct  reconnaissance  missions.  The  new  design  of a  brigade  headquarters  and  two  military  intelligence  battalions  will provide  mission-tailored,  multidiscipline  intelligence  capabilities  for corps, divisions, and BCTs.

## Training

The  HQDA  deputy  chief  of  staff  G-2  established  the  Army Intelligence Training Steering Committee. Its purpose is to provide a forum for identifying operational intelligence training issues or gaps, determining  priorities,  and  developing  options  or  solutions.  The committee  then  sends  its  recommendations  to  the  G-2  and  to  the director of training in the office of the HQDA deputy chief of staff G-3/5/7.  Represented  on  the  committee  are  Forces  Command,  the Army National Guard, the Army Reserve, Army Cyber Command, Army  Special Operations Command,  Intelligence and Security Command, and the Intelligence Center of Excellence.

The Army created the Foundry Program in 2005 to better prepare military  intelligence  soldiers  and  units  for  operational  deployments. The  program  divides  its  courses  into  a  university-type  numbering system that allows a tiered approach to learning. It enables soldiers to sustain intelligence skills pertinent to their unit's mission, to improve their individual and collective technical and analytical skills, and to receive required accreditation and certification training to successfully execute intelligence missions.

In  June  2015,  the  Army  published  a  revised  edition  of Army Regulation 350-32: The Army Foundry Intelligence Training Program , to establish Foundry 2.0. The original Foundry program focused the military intelligence force on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. It relied  on  contractors  to  conduct  training  and  depended on funding from  overseas  contingency  operations  appropriations.  Soldiers  will conduct most training in Foundry 2.0 and base budget appropriations will  fund  the  program.  The  revised  regulation  directs  all  Foundry

The National Training Center conducted one rotation for an Army National Guard BCT and eight rotations for Regular Army BCTs. The Joint Readiness Training Center had one Army National Guard and seven  Regular  Army  BCT  rotations.  Five  Army  service  component command  headquarters,  three  corps  headquarters,  four  division headquarters, five BCT headquarters, four expeditionary sustainment command  headquarters,  four  sustainment  command  headquarters, and  twenty-one  functional  or  multifunctional  brigade  headquarters completed the Mission Command Training Program.

During FY 2015, as part of the Army's assessment of whether and how to open combat arms positions to women, women for the first time attended and graduated from the Ranger School. Early in the fiscal year,  the  Airborne  and  Ranger Training Brigade selected thirty-one female soldiers (eleven officers and twenty noncommissioned officers) to  serve  as  observers  and  advisers  for  women  attending  the  Ranger School. In April 2015, 19 women and 381 men began the first genderintegrated class at the Ranger School. Over the preceding six years, about half of the soldiers who began the course eventually completed the final phase, although some graduates had to recycle through the course.  After  the  four-day  Ranger  assessment  phase,  eight  women and just under half of the men remained. Of these eight women, five were dropped from the course and sent back to their units during the

Shaye L. Haver and Capt. Kristen M. Griest, completed the course and received their Ranger tab in August. The next month, the Army announced that Ranger School was open to women who could meet the selection criteria.

In 2007, the Army began using platoon sergeants instead of drill sergeants in advanced individual training (AIT) classes. These platoon sergeants  are  responsible  for  administrative  actions  and  formation

management. In FY 2015, the AIT Platoon Sergeant Course expanded from a two-week to a six-week program. The Army designed the new program using input from currently serving  AIT  platoon  sergeants. The  expanded  course  will  emphasize  the  platoon  sergeant's  role  in continuing  the  soldier-development  process,  begun  in  basic  combat training,  with  an  emphasis  on  physical  readiness  training,  drill  and ceremonies, and Warrior Tasks and Battle Drills.

Desert combat skills have not been taught in Army schools since the Ranger School ended its desert phase in 1995. The 1st Armored Division at Fort Bliss,  Texas,  ran  its  first  Desert  Warrior  Course  in July 2015. This three-week course is for soldiers serving in squad and team leader positions. Patterned after the Jungle Operations Training Course at  the  East  Range  Training  Center  in  Hawaii  and  the  Cold Weather  Leader's  Course  at  the  Northern  Warfare  Training  Center in  Alaska,  this  new  course  teaches  survival  techniques  and  smallunit tactics in a desert environment and also allows junior soldiers to improve their leadership skills. The course will be offered quarterly. Currently, it is limited to soldiers assigned to Fort Bliss.

## Operational Forces: Afghanistan

On  31  December  2014,  Operation endurIng  Freedom ended. Operation Freedom'S  SenTInel began the next day. Operation Freedom'S SenTInel is  the  United States' contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) Operation reSoluTe SupporT . The new operation's mission is to provide further training, advice, and assistance  for  the  Afghan  security  forces  and  institutions.  In  June 2013, as part of the transition from endurIng Freedom to Freedom'S SenTInel , U.S. Forces, Afghanistan, tasked 1st Sustainment Command with conducting Operation drumbeaT . This operation closed out most American installations in the country by the end of 2014. It discarded equipment and materiel not needed for reSoluTe SupporT or returned it to the United States.

In Operation Freedom'S SenTInel , the Army  provides the headquarters  elements  for  the  U.S.  Forces,  Afghanistan,  National Security Element, and for two of reSoluTe SupporT'S four train, advise, and assist commands: Train, Advise, and Assist Command-East and Train, Advise, and Assist Command-South. It also provides two BCTs, one  each  for  Train,  Advise,  and  Assist  Command-East  and  Train, Advise, and Assist Command-South, as well as an aviation brigade. The mission of the BCTs is to advise units of the Afghan National Army and Afghan police forces and provide the quick reaction forces for each command. Individual soldiers serve as advisers at the Afghan

corps and ministerial levels, and help staff the reSoluTe SupporT and U.S. Forces, Afghanistan, headquarters.

In  December  2014,  about  200  soldiers  from  Headquarters,  3d Infantry Division, assumed the role as the U.S. Forces, Afghanistan, National Security Element. The forward detachment from Headquarters, 1st Cavalry Division, deployed to Afghanistan in June 2014 to serve as the headquarters for Regional Command-South and, after the transition from Operation endurIng Freedom to Operation Freedom'S SenTInel , as the headquarters for Train, Advise, and Assist Command-South. In June 2015, an element from Headquarters, 7th Infantry  Division,  assumed  responsibility  as  the  headquarters  for Train,  Advise,  and  Assist  Command-South.  In  October  2014,  an element from the 3d Infantry Division replaced an element from the 10th Mountain Division as the headquarters for Regional CommandEast,  which  under  Operation Freedom'S  SenTInel became  Train, Advise, and Assist Command-East.

In February 2015, the 3d BCT, 101st Airborne Division, replaced the 3d Cavalry Regiment in Train, Advise, and Assist Command-East. The 2d BCT, 10th Mountain Division, deployed in April 2015 to Train, Advise, and Assist Command-South. In May 2015, a task force from

the Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, replaced one from the Combat Aviation Brigade, 82d Airborne Division.

At  the  end  of  FY  2015,  there  were  6,937  soldiers  deployed  in Afghanistan. Army casualties in Afghanistan during FY 2015 were 8 killed in action and 98 wounded in action.

## Operational Forces: Southwest Asia

During  FY  2015,  the  Army's  commitment  to  the  fight  against the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  increased.  In  FY  2014, U.S.  Army,  Central  (ARCENT),  had  deployed  a  headquarters  to Iraq after being designated the Combined Forces Land Component Command for the conduct of operations in Iraq. Early in FY 2015, DoD  established  Operation InherenT  reSolve with  the  objective of defeating ISIS in designated areas of Iraq and Syria and setting conditions for follow-on operations to increase regional stability. At the same time, ARCENT became the headquarters element for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation InherenT reSolve .  In  September 2015, the III Corps headquarters deployed to Iraq to replace ARCENT as the headquarters element for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation InherenT reSolve .

In October 2014, an element of the headquarters of 1st Infantry Division  deployed  to  serve  as  the  Combined  Joint  Forces  Land Component  Command-Iraq.  This  command  provides  command and control of coalition troops training, advising, and assisting Iraqi security forces. In June 2015, an element of the headquarters of the 82d Airborne Division replaced the 1st Infantry Division in this mission.

The 3d BCT, 82d Airborne Division, deployed in January 2015 to provide advise and assist teams for Iraqi security forces and to secure critical  facilities.  In  September  2015,  the  1st  BCT,  10th  Mountain Division,  assumed  this  mission.  Soldiers  from  the  Army  Reserve's 310th  Sustainment  Command  were  mobilized  early  in  FY  2015  to take over operations at Fort Hood, Texas, from the 13th Sustainment Command, which had deployed to Kuwait. The Army then tasked the 310th  Sustainment  Command  late  in  2014  with  creating  a  logistics advise and assist team. The team, augmented with personnel from other Army Reserve units and from the Regular Army's 82d Sustainment Brigade, arrived in Iraq in February 2015 to work with Iraqi security forces logistics organizations.

In  FY  2014,  the  Army  deployed  a  number  of  AH-64  Apache attack helicopters to Iraq to enhance security for the U.S. embassy. In October 2014, these helicopters began supporting Iraqi security forces by attacking ISIS fighters.

At  the  end  of  FY  2015,  there  were  2,923  soldiers  deployed in  Iraq.  Army  casualties  in  Iraq  during  the  fiscal  year  were  five wounded in action.

During FY 2015, Operation SparTan ShIeld continued in Kuwait to support U.S. Central Command. The 3d BCT, 4th Infantry Division, in  March  2015  replaced  the  1st  BCT,  1st  Infantry  Division.  Also rotating through Kuwait were air defense, aviation, and logistics units. At the end of FY 2015, there were 5,699 soldiers deployed in Kuwait.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, South

U.S. Army, South, is responsible for Army operations in Central and  South  America  and  the  Caribbean.  During  the  fiscal  year,  it conducted 164 security cooperation events with 23 countries in U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. Joint Task Forcebravo , stationed at Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras, and its primary unit, the 1st Battalion, 228th Aviation Regiment, continued to provide helicopter support for medical readiness training, disaster-relief operations, and countering  organized  crime.  Regular  Army  and  mobilized  Army National Guard military police units continued to support Joint Task ForceguanTanamo 's  detainee  operations.  Soldiers  from  the  Texas Army  National  Guard's  72d  BCT,  36th  Infantry  Division,  trained security forces in Guatemala and Honduras as part of the Countering Transnational Organized Crime program.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Africa

In December 2013, an outbreak of the Ebola virus began in Guinea, although the disease was not definitively diagnosed until March 2014. By  then,  the  outbreak  had  spread  to  the  neighboring  countries  of Sierra  Leone  and  Liberia.  In  late  April  and  early  May  of  2014,  it appeared that the outbreak was waning. Cases began to increase again in  early  June,  however,  and  the  epidemic  overwhelmed  the  medical capacity of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. During the first week of August, the U.S. chiefs of mission in those nations declared foreign disasters. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) established a disaster assistance response team in Monrovia, Liberia, to  lead  and  coordinate  the  U.S.  government's  assistance  efforts.  In September,  the  Liberian  government  requested  more  extensive  U.S. support in fighting the epidemic. In response to a Department of State request, the Joint Staff ordered U.S. Africa Command to establish a twenty-five-bed medical unit in Monrovia to treat Liberian healthcare workers who became infected with Ebola. Shortly thereafter, President

Obama directed that the operation be expanded to provide Liberia more assistance.

On 16 September 2014, Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, commanding general  of  USARAF,  and  fourteen  members  of  his  headquarters staff  arrived  in  Monrovia,  to  assess  the  situation.  That  same  day, President Obama announced that the U.S. government's efforts, now designated as Operation unITed aSSISTanCe , had four objectives: (1) control the outbreak in Liberia, (2) address the epidemic's effect on local  economies  and  communities,  (3)  coordinate  a  broader  global response, and (4) build a regional public health system. USAID would lead  the  American  effort  with  the  military  in  support.  U.S.  Africa Command directed USARAF to establish the headquarters for Joint Forces CommandunITed aSSISTanCe (JFC-UA). Its mission was to coordinate military support to USAID's efforts to contain the spread of Ebola in West Africa.

USARAF  did  not  have  the  resources  to  simultaneously  serve as  the  JFC-UA  headquarters  and  as  the  Army  service  component command for Africa Command. In September, HQDA selected the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division to replace USARAF as the  JFC-UA  headquarters.  On  25  October  2014,  General  Williams transferred  command  of  JFC-UA  to  Maj.  Gen.  Gary  J.  Volesky, commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division. Deploying along with  the  division  headquarters  was  the  101st  Sustainment  Brigade. The brigade provided area support to all U.S. military forces in the operation.  Because  no  theater  support  command  or  expeditionary support  command  deployed,  the  brigade  also  had  to  coordinate directly with U.S. Transportation Command, Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Army Materiel Command, and the Defense Logistics Agency.

Soldiers from several types of units deployed for Operation unITed aSSISTanCe .  An  engineer  brigade  headquarters  supervised  the  joint engineer force in Liberia. Elements from a number of Army engineer battalions constructed Ebola treatment units and bases for U.S. forces in theater, and completed all the Ebola treatment units by 20 January 2015.  Elements  of  a  combat  support  hospital  trained  Liberians  in operating  Ebola  treatment  units  and  provided  healthcare  for  JFCUA  personnel.  Teams  from  an  area  mobile  laboratory  conducted epidemiological laboratory testing for the identification of Ebola and other endemic diseases in an expeditious manner. A general support aviation  battalion  task  force  with  UH-60  and  CH-47  helicopters moved personnel and materiel throughout the country. A contingency contracting battalion supervised teams setting contracts for services and materiel from Liberian vendors. Teams from a civil affairs company linked units with local officials and citizens in their areas of operations and connected units with the numerous aid organizations working in Liberia. A military police company was the JFC-UA security force. At peak strength in December 2014, 2,692 soldiers were deployed in Liberia and at an intermediate staging base in Senegal.

In  mid-October 2014, the World Health Organization estimated new Ebola cases could reach 10,000 per week by December, a rate that would overwhelm existing and planned medical facilities and extend the  duration  of  Operation unITed  aSSISTanCe .  In  response  to  this prediction, HQDA began preparing a rotation of units. The secretary of defense in November 2014 authorized the mobilization of about 2,100 soldiers in Army National Guard and Army Reserve units to replace  Regular  Army  units  in  JFC-UA  during  the  spring  of  2015. The predicted increase in Ebola patients, however, did not occur. With the  epidemic  now  receding,  DoD  canceled  the  reserve  components mobilization in January 2015.

The  next  month,  JFC-UA  began  transitioning  its  activities  to other  organizations  and  redeploying  units  to  their  home  stations. The requirement that personnel returning from Ebola-affected areas of  West  Africa  undergo  a  twenty-one-day  quarantine  complicated redeployment.  Ebola  is  not  transmitted  easily  and  the  missions  of

almost  all  military  personnel  excluded  contact  with  Ebola  patients. Nevertheless, the secretary of defense made the quarantine part of the redeployment process out of an abundance of caution and to assure soldiers, their families, and the public in the United States and Europe that  redeploying  troops  would  not  transmit  the  disease.  Limited facilities  for  controlled  monitoring  forced  JFC-UA  to  stagger  the movement of soldiers back to home stations because they could leave West Africa only when space was available for them in a quarantine facility. This requirement significantly extended the time units needed to recover from deployment.

In March, the headquarters of the 48th Chemical Brigade replaced the 101st Airborne Division as the JFC-UA headquarters. The World Health Organization declared Liberia Ebola-free on 9 May and JFCUA concluded operations on 30 June 2015.

## Operational Forces: Asia-Pacific

U.S. Army, Pacific, launched the Pacific Pathways initiative in 2014, combining  multiple  preexisting  exercises  with  partner  nations  into integrated operations. Each operation is a 'pathway' for enhancing the readiness of participating forces, strengthening relationships with allies and partners, and providing a crisis response option for U.S. Pacific Command.  Each  Pathway  operation  deploys  a  battalion-sized  task force and a BCT headquarters for approximately ninety days to conduct a series of exercises. Pathway 15-1, conducted from January to May 2015, using elements of the 2d BCT, 25th Infantry Division, included exercises Cobra gold in Thailand, Foal eagle in South Korea, and balIkaTan in the Philippines. Pathway 15-2 began in June 2015, using elements  of  the  3d  BCT,  25th  Infantry  Division,  included  exercises hamel in  Australia, garuda ShIeld in  Indonesia, and kerIS STrIke in  Malaysia.  It  will  conclude  in  October  2015.  Pathway  15-3  began in June 2015, using elements of the 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division, included exercises khan queST in Mongolia, orIenT ShIeld in Japan, and hoguk in South Korea. It will conclude in November 2015.

In  2004,  the  United  States  and  South  Korean  governments agreed to move all U.S. Army forces to garrisons south of the Han River, most of which will be relocated to Camp Humphreys, about 40 miles south of Seoul on the peninsula's west coast. During FY 2015, construction of new facilities at Camp Humphreys continued. The Army expects that the move of units and headquarters will be completed during FY 2019.

The 2d Infantry Division in June 2015 became a combined U.S. and South Korean organization. The division will now include a Korean

brigade,  have  a  Korean  officer  as  deputy  commanding  general,  and involve a mix of Korean and American officers on the division staff.

The 1st BCT, 2d Infantry Division, inactivated during FY 2015. To replace it, the Army began a program of deploying an armored BCT to Korea on a nine-month rotation. The 2d BCT, 1st Cavalry Division,  deployed  from  Fort  Hood,  Texas,  in  June  2015  to  begin the first rotation under this program. In June 2015, the first rotation of a multiple-launch rocket system battalion from the United States to Korea began. Battalions deployed under this program will spend nine months in Korea to augment the 210th Field Artillery Brigade's counterfire capabilities. The initial rotating unit will leave its equipment in place for future rotations.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army, Europe

Begun  in  response  to  Russia's  aggression  against  Ukraine  in 2014, Operation aTlanTIC reSolve is a series of operations, actions, and  activities  by  U.S.  European  Command  that  demonstrate  the commitment  of  the  United  States  to  the  security  of  its  allies  and partners  in  Europe.  Because  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  has  no  assigned division  headquarters  and  only  three  assigned  maneuver  brigades, none  of  which  are  an  armored  BCT,  the  Army  in  FY  2015  began deploying units from the United States to support aTlanTIC reSolve operations. In October 2014, the 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, the Army's European Command regionally aligned force, began deploying units for aTlanTIC reSolve rotations.  These  units,  along  with  units assigned to U.S. Army, Europe, participated in multinational exercises in Eastern Europe with allied and partner nations.

Later  in  FY  2015,  the  1st  BCT,  3d  Infantry  Division,  replaced the 1st BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, as the European regionally aligned force. The brigade moved to Europe in March 2015 for its first threemonth aTlanTIC  reSolve deployment.  In  February  2015,  the  4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, began supplying a mission command element to U.S. Army, Europe. It oversees the rotational units and provides a division-level command and control capability. Mobilized  reserve  component  units  also  deployed  to  Europe  for rotations during FY 2015. The European Reassurance Initiative, which is part of the overseas contingency operations appropriation in the FY 2015 budget, funds aTlanTIC reSolve operations. This appropriation pays for rotational forces, infrastructure upgrades, and other support to allies and partners in Europe.

Central to U.S. Army, Europe's concept for aTlanTIC reSolve is  the idea of 'dynamic presence'-enhancing deterrence by demonstrating the command's capability to operate in allied and partner nations. One of the most visible examples of this concept in FY 2015 was Exercise dragoon rIde , conducted by the 3d Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, between 21 March and 1 April 2015. The squadron had been deployed since January 2015 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Instead of moving its vehicles back to its home station in Germany by rail, the squadron conducted a 1,100-mile road march. Convoys originating in Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland converged in the Czech Republic and then  headed  home to Germany. Helicopters from the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade and other NATO air assets supported the convoys.

Although  the  initial focus of aTlanTIC  reSolve had  been northeastern Europe, where NATO's most vulnerable members were located, in FY 2015 the operation extended into southeastern Europe. In March 2015, soldiers from the 173d Airborne Brigade and the 2d Cavalry Regiment conducted a training exercise with the Romanian military, marking the start of periodic training rotations to Romania and  Bulgaria.  The  Army  expects  rotations  to  Hungary  to  begin  in early FY 2016.

During  FY  2015,  U.S.  Army,  Europe,  continued  to  support Ukrainian  security  forces.  In  April  2015,  two  companies  and  a

battalion staff from the 173d Airborne Brigade deployed there for the first  of  three  two-month training rotations under Exercise FearleSS guardIan .  During  the  rotations,  soldiers  from  the  brigade  trained three  battalions  of  Ukraine's  newly  formed  national  guard  forces. In  July  2015,  U.S.  troops  participated  in  the  long-standing  Exercise rapId TrIdenT , a cooperative multinational training exercise focused on  peacekeeping  and  stability  operations,  held  at  the  International Peacekeeping and Security Centre in Ukraine.

At the beginning of FY 2015, the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade in  Germany  was  the  Army's  largest  aviation  brigade  with  seven battalions.  During  FY  2015,  the  Army  reorganized  the  brigade  as part  of  the  Aviation  Restructure  Initiative.  Three  of  the  brigade's battalions inactivated and two moved out of Europe. At the end of the restructuring, the brigade had one attack battalion and one general support  aviation  battalion.  To  provide  the  theater  with  additional aviation capabilities, the Army began deploying an aviation battalion task force to Germany on a nine-month rotation. The task force has an assault helicopter battalion, two medical evacuation teams, and an airtraffic service company. In March 2015, the 4th Battalion, 3d Aviation Regiment, deployed from Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, as the first rotational aviation task force in Europe.

## Operational Forces: Domestic Operations

For  the  first  time  since  2006,  Regular  Army  soldiers  deployed to  fight  wildfires.  About  200  soldiers  from  the  5th  Battalion,  3d Field  Artillery  Regiment,  Joint  Base  Lewis-McChord,  Washington, formed  Task  Force FIrST  round , which  deployed  on  22  August 2015 to help fight fires in the Colville National Forest, Washington. Before deploying, wildland firefighters with the National Interagency Fire Center trained the soldiers on firefighting techniques and safety measures. The task force provided ten crews that freed up some civilian crews  for  use  against  other  wildfires  until  it  returned  to  Joint  Base Lewis-McChord on 11 September.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Structure

The Army National  Guard  had  fourteen  general  officer  level  headquarters: eight divisions, two expeditionary sustainment commands, one army air and missile defense command, one military police command, one theater aviation command, and one theater sustainment command. It had 126 operational brigades  and  groups:  28  BCTs;  48  multifunctional  support  brigades;  48 functional support brigades and groups; and 2 Special Forces groups. The full-time  personnel  for  this  force  structure  included  31,385  Active  Guard and Reserve soldiers and 28,810 military technicians. The Army Reserve is organized into training commands and functional commands, with the latter type including medical, aviation, signal, sustainment, engineer , military police, civil affairs, and psychological operations units.

To provide operational surge capability for Army Cyber Command, the Army National Guard is creating eleven cyber protection teams: one fulltime team and ten teams ready for mobilization when needed. The teams will be responsible for conducting defensive cyberspace operations, readiness inspections, vulnerability assessments, and a variety of other cyber roles and missions. This initiative is the result of ongoing collaboration between the Army National Guard and Army Cyber Command, and builds upon the existing Guard cyber force structure of one data processing unit and fifty-four computer network defense teams. The 1636th Cyber Protection Team, the full-time team, stood up during the first quarter of FY 2015. The other teams will be stood up over the next three fiscal years.

Through the State Partnership Program, Army National Guard units conduct a broad range of military-to-military engagements in support of defense security goals. In FY 2015, the Army added two new  partnerships  to  the  program:  Massachusetts  with  Kenya  and Kentucky with Djibouti. The Army National Guard conducted over 750 partnership events during the fiscal year.

## Mobilization

The Army National Guard mobilized 10,123 soldiers for federal active duty to support combatant commands in ongoing operations,

exercises,  training  events,  and  security  cooperation  activities.  The majority  of  these  soldiers-7,215-deployed  to  the  U.S.  Central Command  area.  Other  deployments were 902 to U.S. Africa Command; 856 to U.S. Southern Command; 576 to U.S. European Command; and 574 to U.S. Northern Command. There were 453,849 soldier-days in 64 incidents of defense support of civil authorities in the United States during FY 2015.

At  the  end  of  FY  2015,  14,438  Army  Reserve  soldiers  were  in active-duty  status  supporting  combatant  commands  and  another 2,960 soldiers engaged in training support missions in the continental United States. During FY 2015, the Army ordered an additional 1,656 Army Reserve soldiers to active duty under the provisions of Title 10, United States Code § 12304(b) to support preplanned missions for five combatant commands.

The Army National Guard continued Operation phalanx during FY 2015. Established in July 2010 in accordance with a presidential executive order, the operation provides support to the Department of Homeland Security along the southern border of the United States. In March 2012, Operation phalanx shifted from deploying soldiers on the ground at fixed locations to aerial patrols along the border, with some National Guard

security and intelligence analysts assisting federal law enforcement. During this  fiscal  year ,  soldiers  from  more  than  twenty  states  and  territories mobilized  for  the  operation.  Army  National  Guard  aviators  flew  over 7,600 hours and contributed to U.S. Customs and Border Protection's apprehension of more than 28,000 undocumented aliens and the seizure of over 42,000 pounds of marijuana and other narcotics.

## Training

During this fiscal year, First Army, a Regular Army unit, continued its Bold Shift restructuring. First Army advises, assists, and trains reserve  component units both before and after mobilization. Begun in 2014, Bold Shift is part of the service's efforts to transition from the predictable deployment cycles of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to a new environment featuring a smaller force that must prepare for changing global commitments and a renewed emphasis on high-intensity combined arms operations. This requires reserve component units to  maintain  a  higher  readiness  level  to  minimize  postmobilization times. First Army therefore shifted its training focus from postmobilization to premobilization while retaining the capability to conduct postmobilization training.

Under  Bold  Shift,  First  Army  will  reduce  its  training  brigades from  sixteen  to  nine.  The  training  brigade  restructuring  began  in January 2015 and will be completed by the first quarter of FY 2016. First Army organized six combined arms training brigades to support Army National Guard BCTs. Three multifunctional training brigades will  support  functional  and  multifunctional  brigades  in  the  Army National  Guard  and  the  Army  Reserve.  The  reorganized  brigade formations  are  larger  than  the  previous  brigades,  provide  increased training  support  capacity  for  functional  and  multifunctional  units, and use an operations group-type capability similar to that found at the combat training centers. Soldiers from all three components staff the brigades.

The  demand  for  cybersecurity  soldiers  now  is  larger  than  the number of these soldiers. In February 2015, the Army Reserve launched a cyber private-public partnership, Cyber P3, to increase the number of  its  soldiers  with  cyber  operation  skills.  The  agreement  with  six universities and twelve companies will allow soldiers to enter the cyber field,  enhance  existing  skills,  and  maintain  continuous  professional education. The program will prepare individuals to fill cyber related positions in both their civilian employment and in the Army Reserve.

units  with  support  for  Army  Materiel  Command.  The  operation moved Army pre-positioned stocks and war reserve containers from Military  Ocean  Terminal  Sunny  Point,  North  Carolina,  to  Joint Munitions Command depots across the country. Army Reserve units and contracted  stevedores  offloaded  more  than  2,500  containers  of equipment and munitions from U.S. Army Vessel Lt. Col. John U.D. Page , of which 833 containers were for Operation paTrIoT bandoleer . Army National Guard transportation units from six states then moved these containers to the depots. About halfway through the exercise, an additional 517 pieces of equipment were added to the operation, which transportation units moved from the terminal to Army Strategic Logistics Activity Charleston in Goose Creek, South Carolina.

The Army National Guard's Exportable Combat Training Capability is an instrumented field-training exercise designed to certify platoon proficiency. It provides an experience at a unit's home station similar to that at a combat training center or a regional training center, minimizing  cost  and  time  away  from  home  and  jobs.  In  FY  2015, 17,100 soldiers in 196 companies from 6 BCTs and 5 multifunctional brigades completed either a 15- or a 21-day training exercise.



## Management

The Logistics  Modernization  Program  (LMP),  underway  since 2003,  will  replace  the  two  largest  national-level  logistics  systems: the inventory management Commodity Command Standard System,  and  the  depot  and  arsenal  operations  Standard  Depot System.  The  program  will  transform  Army  logistics  operations  in eight core business areas: acquisition, distribution, finance, product lifecycle  management, supply chain planning, depots and arsenals, maintenance, and warehouse inventory management. As with Global Combat  Support  System-Army,  the  service  made  use  of  existing commercially available technology, instead of developing an entirely new one, and it began implementing the new system in waves. Fielding of LMP's Increment 2 began in January 2014. In June 2015, fielding of Increment 2, Wave 3, began. The Army expects to complete this wave's  fielding,  the  final  wave  in  Increment  2  in  2016.  Increment 2 expands  on  the  already operational production  baseline to specifically address shop-floor automation, automatic identification technology, expanded ammunition requirements, strategic business transformation  goals,  and  specific  DoD  directives  such  as  unique item  identification.  The  Increment  2  expanded  capabilities  enable LMP  to  provide  mission-critical  information  about  production activities across the supply chain.

The  Global  Combat  Support  System-Army  is  a  logistics  and financial system for both units and installations. It tracks supplies, spare  parts,  organizational  equipment,  unit  maintenance,  and  financial transactions related to logistics. The system, based on a commercial software program, replaces the Standard Army  Management Information Systems and integrates about 40,000 local supply and logistics databases. Fielding has been accomplished using the wave approach to avoid disruption to ongoing operations. In November 2015,  the  Army  completed  Wave  1  fielding,  which  had  begun  in February 2013. In total, 281 supply-support activities received this wave, which replaced the Standard Army Retail Supply System, the Single  Stock  Fund/Middleware,  and  the  Funds  Control  Module.

Wave 2 will replace the Property Book Unit Supply-Enhanced and the Standard Maintenance System-Enhanced. Full deployment for Wave 2 began in  August  2015  and  is  scheduled  for  completion  in November 2017. It will convert property books and unit funding to the  new  system  and  manage  maintenance  aspects  in  motor  pools. The Wave 2 effort has forty-four materiel fielding teams and roughly three times as many simultaneous fielding events as during Wave 1.

## Initiatives

The Army Equipment Modernization Strategy, published in March 2015, describes how the Army will apply resources to adapt materiel in the near-term, evolve programs in the midterm, and innovate within science and technology for the long-term. The strategy resides with the Army Operating Concept so leaders can focus resources to maintain strategic  and  operational  flexibility.  The  strategy's  objectives  are  to enhance the soldier for broad joint-mission support, enable mission command, and remain prepared for joint combined arms maneuver. To mitigate risk in the uncertain fiscal environment, the service will sustain  science  and  technology  investments,  leverage  current  fleets, build new systems only by exception, and delay the next generation of platforms until they are affordable.

Through the near-term (2016-2020), the Army will use existing capabilities in new ways, modify and adapt capabilities to respond to new needs, and more rapidly exploit new opportunities with innovative approaches.  In  the  midterm  (2021-2029),  the  Army  will  evolve capabilities to retain its ability to prevent or mitigate opposing forces from using their current or projected equipment or tactics. It also will enhance capabilities  to  deploy  rapidly  and  conduct  operations  with sufficient  scale  to  accomplish  assigned  missions.  For  the  long-term (2030-2045), the Army will innovate with less mature but promising technologies  to  sustain  its  asymmetrical  advantages  and  achieve significant leaps in warfighting efficiency and effectiveness.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The  Army  identified ten critical funded  programs  in  three categories (network, vehicle, and aviation) to synchronize equipment modernization  during  FY  2015.  In  the  network  category  were: Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T); the family of  Networked  Tactical  Radios;  Joint  Battle  Command-Platform; Distributed  Common  Ground  System-Army  (DCGS-A);  and  Net Warrior.  In  the  vehicles  category  were:  Armored  Multi-Purpose

Vehicles;  Paladin  Integrated  Management;  and  Joint  Light  Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs). In the aviation category were AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.

The Army conducted two Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs) at  Fort  Bliss,  Texas,  and  White  Sands  Missile  Range,  New  Mexico: NIE  15.1  in  October  and  November  2014,  and  NIE  15.2  in  April and May 2015. The purpose of an NIE is operational testing with a focus on tactical mission-command networks. The NIEs also evaluate emerging capabilities that are not formal acquisition programs. These 'systems under evaluation' are not acquisition programs of record, but rather systems that may offer value for future development. The Test  and  Evaluation  Command's  Operational  Test  Command,  in conjunction  with  the  Brigade  Modernization  Command,  develops realistic operational scenarios for each NIE. The 2d BCT, 1st Armored Division, is the dedicated NIE test unit. During NIE 15.1, the Army conducted  a  follow-on  operational  test  and  evaluation  for  WIN-T Increment  2.  During  NIE  15.2,  the  Army  conducted  a  follow-on operational test and evaluation for the DCGS-A Increment 1, Release 2, and a limited user test for the AN/VRC-118 Midtier Networking Vehicular Radio.

The  WIN-T is  the  Army's  internet  protocol-based  satellite  and line-of-sight communications network that supports voice, data, and video communications for units at theater level and below. The Army approved WIN-T program requirements in December 2000 and will field  the  system  in  three  increments.  In  2012,  the  Army  completed fielding the first increment, which created the backbone for an at-thehalt  network  that  provides  the  full  range  of  data,  voice,  and  video communications  to  command  posts  at  the  battalion  echelon  and above. The service began fielding Increment 2 in October 2012. This increment  permits  soldiers  to  use  WIN-T  from  moving  vehicles.  In 2014, fiscal constraints led the Army to restructure the third increment, which would have produced a full networking on-the-move capability using  airborne  communications  relays.  This  change  eliminated  the requirements  for  hardware  but  retained  the  development  efforts to  complete  the  network  operations  software  and  the  Net  Centric Waveform 10.X software upgrade, which will then be used to update Increments 1 and 2.

By June 2015, the Army had fielded Increment 2 to twelve BCTs and four division headquarters for their use during deployments to Afghanistan. The defense acquisition executive, who approved WIN-T Increment 2 for full-rate production in June 2015, directed the Army to  correct  performance deficiencies  and  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities identified  during  NIE  15.1.  The  Johns  Hopkins  University  and  the

Army Research Laboratory will examine these issues and recommend in  FY  2016  what  improvements  to  user-training  techniques  and hardware  and  software  enhancements  are  necessary  to  remedy  any deficiencies and  vulnerabilities. In September  2015,  the  defense acquisition  executive  delegated  the  milestone  decision  authority  for WIN-T Increment 2 to the Army.

At  NIE  15.2,  the  AN/VRC-118  Midtier  Networking  Vehicular Radio underwent a limited user test. A key feature of this radio is its ability to provide terrestrial, ground-level connectivity with restricted or nonexistent satellite communications across the brigade, battalion, and company echelons. During the evaluation, the system enhanced the units' midtier networks when satellite communications were available. In  a  reduced  satellite  network  environment,  however,  the  network message completion rate did not meet the Army's requirement. The system experienced faults that prevented battalions from sending or receiving any data for extended periods, even when radios were within line of sight of each other. The Army is developing a test and evaluation master plan to support a January 2016 Milestone C decision.

DCGS-A connects units from battalions to echelons above corps with  intelligence  agencies;  other  military  services;  joint  intelligence, surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  platforms  and  sensors;  and  the Army's mission command systems. It gives units the ability to view information  in  one  place  and  integrate  that  information  into  tools that  can  support  intelligence  development.  Initial  testing  of  the system  in  2012  found  a  number  of  shortcomings.  In  response,  the Army  reconfigured  DCGS-A  into  Increment  1,  Release  1,  which contained only the secret-level components; Increment 1, Release 2, which contained top secret/sensitive compartmented information; and Increment 1, Release 3, which included a cloud-computing capability to support worldwide intelligence analysis, database synchronization, and  operations  in  disconnected  or  low-bandwidth  environments. The  defense  acquisition  executive  approved  the  full  deployment of  this  configuration.  In  December  2014,  the  under  secretary  of defense (acquisition, technology, and logistics) approved the Army's modification of this acquisition strategy that ended Increment 1 with completion  of  Release  2  deployment.  Requirements  allocated  for Release 3 will now be allocated to Increment 2. Evaluation of Release 2 during NIE 15.2 in May 2015 showed that it has resolved the shortfalls with database discrepancies and intelligence fusion tools. The first unit fielding of Increment 1, Release 2, will be completed during the second quarter of FY 2016.

The Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) is the Army's nextgeneration mounted situational awareness and friendly force tracking

system  that  provides  on-the-move  digital  command  and  control. During October and November 2014, the Army conducted testing of JBC-P 6.0 to verify fixes of deficiencies noted during the May 2014 multiservice operational test and evaluation. The system continued to exhibit phantom Mayday messages and a new deficiency of delayed position location updates appeared. Based on these results, the Army did not approve a full materiel release. Instead, it approved a conditional materiel release to field JBC-P with the 4th BCT, 3d Infantry Division, at Fort Stewart, Georgia, for continued testing.

The  Armored  Multi-Purpose  Vehicle  (AMPV)  will  replace the M113 family of vehicles, a design first fielded in the 1960s, of which approximately 3,000 variants remain in service. The AMPV will  replace  the  M113  at  the  brigade  level  and  below  in  five  roles: general  purpose,  medical  evacuation,  medical  treatment,  mortar carrier, and mission command. Although the AMPV utilizes a new hull  design,  it  is  derived  from  the  Bradley  Fighting  Vehicle  and  a majority of AMPV subsystems are from the Bradley. In December 2014,  the  defense  acquisition  executive  authorized  the  program  to enter at Milestone B. An integrated baseline review occurred at the contractor's  facility  in  August  2015,  verifying  the  contractor  can accomplish the engineering and manufacturing development scope of work on time and within budget.

The  JLTV  is  an  Army  and  Marine  Corps  program  to  produce vehicles  and  companion  trailers.  There  will  be  two-  and  four-seat variants  and  four  mission  package  configurations:  general  purpose, heavy-gun carrier, close-combat-weapons carrier, and a utility/shelter carrier. The Army and Marine Corps will procure approximately 17,000 vehicles under the contract. In August 2015, the defense acquisition executive approved the program to enter Milestone C with low-rate initial production. That same month, the Army awarded a firm-fixedprice production contract for low-rate initial production to start in the first quarter of FY 2016. In September 2015, one of the corporations that had competed for the contract but had not been selected filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office. It claimed that its design for the JLTV was more capable and more affordable. The Army suspended work on the program for the remainder of the fiscal year as the Government Accountability Office reviewed the protest.

The Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS) is the Army's next-generation C-12 aircraft for crewed  airborne  intelligence  collection,  processing,  and  targeting support. In FY 2014, the Milestone C decision approved an acquisition strategy  for  twenty-four  aircraft  in  four  variants:  four  EMARSS-S for signals intelligence; eight EMARSS-G for geospatial intelligence; eight EMARSS-M multi-intelligence platforms; and four EMARSS-V equipped  with  the  Vehicle  and  Dismount  Exploitation  Radar.  The four EMARSS-S were delivered at the end of FY 2015.

The  Guided  Multiple  Launch  Rocket  System  has  two  fielded variants.  The  unitary  variant  uses  a  single  200-pound-class,  highexplosive  charge  to  attack  targets  with  low  collateral  damage.  The dual-purpose improved conventional munition variant disperses 404 submunitions to attack area targets. Some of these submunitions fail to function, creating an unexploded ordnance hazard. To comply with the 2008 DoD policy on cluster munitions and unintended harm to civilians, the Army began working on an alternative warhead to reduce the  potential  for  unexploded ordnance hazards. The alternative is a large airburst fragmentation warhead, which explodes around thirty feet  above  the  ground,  filling  the  air  with  hundreds  of  bullet-like penetrator projectiles. The result can cause considerable damage to a large area but, unlike cluster munitions, leaves behind only the solid metal penetrators and inert rocket fragments. The alternative warhead completed the combined Milestone C and full-rate production review in April 2015. In May 2015, the Army acquisition executive approved full-rate production and the Army awarded a contract the next month.

The  Operational  Camouflage  Pattern  Army  Combat  Uniform became available for purchase by soldiers in July 2015. It replaces

the  Universal  Camouflage  Pattern  Army  Combat  Uniform  worn in  garrison  and  the  Operation endurIng  Freedom Camouflage Pattern  Army  Combat  Uniform  used  in  theater.  The  Operational Camouflage Pattern provides soldiers an effective camouflage pattern optimized  for  both  day  and  night  operations  in  a  full  range  of operating environments. Additionally, the Operational Camouflage Pattern uniforms incorporates minor design changes. These include redesigned shoulder sleeve pockets with a zipper opening, no trouser drawstring, a button on the lower calf pocket, two pen pockets on the sleeve instead of three, and the elimination of the elbow and knee patch hook and loop.

Military clothing sales stores will receive the new uniforms over a period of six months from July to November. New enlisted soldiers

will  receive  the  uniform  beginning  in  January  2016.  Uniforms  and equipment  in  the  Operational  Camouflage  Pattern  will  become available for members of the Army National Guard, the Army Reserve, and the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps during summer 2016. The Army authorized soldiers to mix and match T-shirts, belts, and

boots  with  either  the  Operation endurIng  Freedom Camouflage Pattern  or  the  Operational  Camouflage  Pattern  during  a  transition period expected to run through the end of FY 2019. Soldiers who have flame-resistant Army Combat Uniforms in the Operation endurIng Freedom Camouflage Pattern will be authorized to wear them during the transition.

In September 2015, the secretary of the Army directed an immediate safety review at all DoD labs and facilities involved in the production, shipment, and handling of live and inactivated select biological agents and toxins. The secretary of the Army is the executive agent for the DoD Biological Select Agent and Toxin Biosafety program. The secretary ordered this review after the discovery of anthrax contamination at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. It was found in secure areas located outside the primary containment area, but still contained within the special  enclosed  lab  for  holding  it.  This  discovery  followed  findings by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  of  incorrect  or incomplete record keeping at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, in  Aberdeen,  Maryland,  and  the  U.S.  Army  Research  Institute  of Infectious Disease in Frederick, Maryland. The Army expects a report on the results of the review in early FY 2016.

## Installations

In March 2015, the Army published Execute Order (EXORD) 16415. It initiated an effort to reduce installations' footprint by making all reasonable efforts to maximize space utilization, consolidate units into the best facilities, and dispose of excess assets. The objective is to optimize the use of existing facilities and reduce the real property portfolio to match mission requirements. Retaining the best facilities and  disposing  of  failing  excess  facilities  will  allow  the  Army  to better support the changing force structure through repurposing and reduce  sustainment  and  energy  costs.  The  EXORD  required  senior commanders to develop a plan that consolidated mission requirements into  the  best  facilities  available,  divested  unneeded  or  underutilized assets,  addressed  repurposing  of  desirable  assets  to  other  needed missions, and eliminated off-post leases beginning in 2015.

The under secretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army approved the Energy Security and Sustainability Strategy in May 2015. The strategy addresses the need for secure access to energy, water, and land resources in a rapidly changing world. As part of the strategy,  the  Army  continues  targeted  installation  energy  efforts  on both efficiency and development of renewable energy projects.

FY 2015 continued a two-year trend in facility energy use intensity reduction, achieving an overall energy use intensity of 79,700 Btus per square foot per year. Renewable energy capacity increased for the third year  as  the  service  added  over  40  megawatts.  The  service  exceeded potable,  industrial,  landscaping,  and  agriculture  water  conservation goals. The Army is now ahead of schedule on reducing by FY 2020 its potable water intensity by 26 percent from the FY 2007 baseline. The Army exceeded the FY 2015 cumulative fossil fuel reduction goal of 20 percent with a 41 percent reduction. This also exceeds the mandated FY 2020 cumulative goal of 30 percent. The Army cut the nontactical vehicle fleet by 1,134 vehicles, for a total reduction of over 16,400 since FY 2011.

During FY 2015, the final phase of the privatization of the Army lodging program transferred 2,058 rooms at Fort Lee, Virginia, and

Fort Benning, Georgia, to a private partner. A $715 million loan from a bank in September 2015 will, in combination with operational income over the next six-and-a-half years, fund more than $1 billion worth of development to continue across the service's 12,432-room privatized lodging portfolio.

The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission selected Fort  McPherson,  Georgia,  for  closure.  The  Army  closed  it  in September 2011. It was primarily an administrative post after World War II,  with  488  acres  containing  several  large  office  buildings,  a picturesque historic district, a health clinic, housing, and an 18-hole golf course. The Army conveyed 436 acres of environmentally clean property to the McPherson Implementing Redevelopment Authority under an economic development conveyance in June 2015. The Army received $13 million for the property with another $10 million payable on  the  third  anniversary  of  the  settlement,  and  three  $1  million payments payable on the fifth, sixth, and seventh anniversaries. The Army  secured  a  letter  of  credit  with  a  bank  to  secure  the  future payments in the event of any unforeseen economic circumstances.. Because  of  environmental  contamination,  four  parcels  containing approximately forty-one acres of property could not be transferred with the conveyance. The Army will continue cleanup of this land and expects to transfer it by FY 2021.

## Public Affairs

During  the  fiscal  year,  the  U.S.  Army  Facebook  page  grew  from 2,947,613  page  likes  to  3,520,813  page  likes.  The  U.S.  Army  Twitter account grew from 521,586 followers to 704,068 followers. There were 7,091,245  mobile-device  visitors  to  Army .mil,  which  is  a  2.19  percent increase from FY 2014. Average time spent on the page by mobile users increased  by  5.43  percent  from  FY  2014.  Overall,  however,  Army .mil experienced a decline of 5.12 percent in visits from FY 2014. The new Google search policy implemented in April 2015, which expanded its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal, may have affected the organic search ranking for Army.mil, which was not mobile-friendly in 2015.

In FY 2015, the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs emphasized increasing  the  service's  online  presence  and  taking  a  less  defensive approach to telling the Army's story. As part of this effort, the office began  an  outreach  initiative  called  'Meet  Y our  Army.'  It  brings soldiers to communities where the service has little or no presence to help connect it with the American people, educate them about their Army,  and  build  trust  and  confidence  in  the  service.  Soldiers  meet with  civic  leaders,  students,  and  the  general  public;  conduct  media

interviews; and utilize social media to tell the Army story to audiences in  these  areas.  The  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Public  Affairs  created  a Meet Your Army tool kit for units and organizations. It provides a detailed explanation of each step in the Meet Y our Army planning and execution cycle, templates, and other resources.

Between January and March 2015, the Army conducted community  listening  sessions  at  thirty  installations  in  the  United States.  The  sessions'  purpose  was  to  gather  comments  from  local officials and residents in communities around these posts regarding the June  2014  Supplemental  Programmatic  Environmental  Assessment. This assessment reviewed changes the Army would have to make if the  Budget  Control  Act's  sequestration  provisions  were  used  in  FY 2016  and  analyzed  what  effects  personnel  strength  cutbacks  and installation size reductions would have on local communities. Before making any final decisions regarding these cuts, the Army will take into consideration public concerns raised during the listening sessions.

## Legislative Liaison

The major Army issues among members of Congress were sexual assault  in  the  military,  the  effects  of  reduced  funding  driven  by  the Budget Control Act and sequestration, base realignment and closure, and the Aviation Restructure Initiative.

During the fiscal year, the Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison handled 37,600 congressional inquiries. Of these, Congress addressed 408 to Army senior leaders, of which the secretary of the Army reviewed and signed 163 replies worked through the Red Top tasking process. Constituent  issues  referred  to  the  Army  by  members  of  Congress included  awards,  medical  concerns,  financial  issues,  records,  and various military personnel issues such as discharges and separations, enlistments,  and  assignments.  Legislative  Liaison  supported  visits to  Army  installations  made  by  98  members  of  Congress  and  their delegations and 200 congressional staff delegations.

## Safety

In FY 2015, 111 soldiers died in accidents, a 12 percent decrease from FY 2014. The largest cause of accidental deaths continued to be  accidents  involving  privately  owned  vehicles,  with  seventy-two deaths.  Other  causes  were:  nineteen  from  personal  injury;  five  from Army motorized vehicles; three from Army combat vehicles, two from other  Army  operated  vehicles,  six  from  aviation  mishaps,  and  four from weapons and explosives. The Army had 2,769 Class A to Class

C ground mishaps and 101 Class A to Class C aviation mishaps, to include remotely piloted systems.

In  August  2015,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  established  a  new Safety  and  Occupational  Health  Senior  Executive  Council,  along with its standing subcommittee, the Safety and Occupational Health Synchronization Oversight Council. These organizations replaced the Army Safety Coordinating Panel General Officer Steering Committee and the Safety and Occupational Health/Human Resources Synchronization Oversight Council. Cochaired by the assistant secretary of the Army (installations, energy and environment) and the vice chief of staff of the Army, the Safety and Occupational Health Senior Executive Council provides collective governance of safety and occupational health. It serves as a single forum to review and assess important matters in these areas for the Department of the Army. By consolidating the functions of former steering committees, councils, boards,  and  working  groups,  the  Safety  and  Occupational  Health Senior Executive Council ensures issues are handled appropriately and integrated into relevant institutional processes for action or elevated to senior leaders for guidance and decision.

## Special Functions

The Surgeon General

The Performance Triad program seeks to motivate healthy behaviors that support individual soldier performance and resilience, as well as a lifestyle of healthy behaviors for soldiers and their families. It includes messaging,  curriculum  and  training,  policy  development,  technology, leader development, and changes within the installation environment to make a healthy choice the easy choice. In a pilot of the program in FY 2014, the majority of soldiers participating did not meet the Performance Triad targets. Only 5 percent met all sleep targets, only 42 percent met all activity targets, and only 3.6 percent met all nutrition targets. After a redesign of the curriculum, a second pilot began in FY 2015 with five brigades stationed in the United States.

In October 2014, the New York Times published an article reporting that from 2004 to 2011 American and Iraqi troops encountered, and on at least six occasions were wounded by, chemical weapons produced by Saddam Hussein's regime in the 1980s. The article alleged that the DoD kept these encounters secret, ordered U.S. troops not to report these encounters,  and  prevented  injured  personnel  from  receiving  proper medical treatment and a Purple Heart to recognize their wounding.

After publication of this article, DoD formed a working group, led  by  the  under  secretary  of  the  Army.  The  group  had  four  goals: (1) identify, contact, and gather information about service members' and  veterans'  potential  chemical  weapon  agent  exposures;  (2)  refer those with plausible exposure for a medical examination; (3) ensure that  examination  information  is  included  in  the  service  members' medical  records  and  provide  notification  to  the  Department  of Veterans Affairs; (4) and consider recognizing service members and veterans with a Purple Heart where appropriate.

The working group designated the Army's Public Health Center (Provisional) as the DoD lead agency for the identification of service members  potentially  exposed  to  weaponized  chemical  agents.  The center contacted and interviewed current and former service members of the Army and Navy who may have been exposed. The Marine Corps assumed this responsibility for marines who may have been exposed.

The services used unit rosters, Post-Deployment Health Assessments, and the Force Health Protection Hotline to identify those who may have been exposed.

Any  service  member  or  veteran  who  was  determined  to  have a  confirmed  or  likely  exposure  was  offered  a  clinical  assessment. Additionally, persons considered to have no evidence of a symptomatic exposure could request and be granted an examination. Assessments were conducted at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. In order for veterans to receive an assessment, the Army placed  them  in  Secretarial  Designee  status  so  they  could  be  given invitational travel orders.

Between October 2014 and March 2015, 7,504 service members and veterans were evaluated. Two hundred sixty-six individuals were categorized as confirmed or likely to have had a symptomatic exposure. In March 2015, the under secretary of the Army apologized for the treatment of service members exposed to chemical weapons in Iraq. He stated that the military services had not complied with policies in effect at the time regarding chemical weapon agent exposure. He also announced that the Army had approved awarding a Purple Heart to a soldier burned by sulfur mustard agent and that he expected more medals to be issued after further review.

In  October  2014,  the  secretary  of  defense  directed  the  military health system to improve access, quality of care, and patient safety by transforming into a high-reliability organization. In 2015, MEDCOM established the deputy chief of staff for quality and safety to align all human research protections, quality, patient safety, and occupational safety and health elements within the same directorate. This alignment provides  a  synergistic  environment  to  analyze  problem  areas  and best  practices  across  quality  and  safety  spectrums  from  within  the command and in consultation with external experts.

In FY 2015, 128 active duty, 98 Army National Guard, and 57 Army Reserve soldiers died by suicide. In all three components, the number of suicides increased from FY 2014: by ten in the active Army, eight in the Army National Guard, and thirteen in the Army Reserve.

## The Inspector General

In  FY  2015,  inspectors  general  worked  on  32,083  inquiries from soldiers,  family  members,  civilian  employees,  and  members  of the  public  who  requested  assistance  in  resolving  an  Army-related issue. The most frequent type of request, at 34 percent of the total, concerned  command  and  leadership  issues.  These  requests  dealt primarily with the leaders' actions to redress soldier or family member

problems. The second most prevalent request, at 19 percent, concerned military personnel management issues. These requests primarily dealt with enlisted promotions, leave and pass concerns, and flagging action issues. Finance and accounting issues were 10 percent of all requests. These assistance requests mainly concerned problems with allowance payments  and  bonuses  for  enlistment,  reenlistment,  and  extending overseas service. Personal misconduct were 5 percent of all requests. These requests primarily dealt with issues involving harassment and maltreatment, false statements, and Privacy Act violations.

The secretary of the Army, the chief of staff of the Army, or the vice  chief  of  staff  of  the  Army  direct  Inspector  General  systemic inspections.  These  inspections  assess  the  health  of  an  entire  Army system and inspectors make recommendations on how that system can be improved. In FY 2015, Inspector General teams conducted several systemic  inspections.  An  inspection  of  uncleared  contractor  access to Army installations between April and November 2014 found that installation staff understanding of the installation access process and commander oversight of it was lacking Army-wide. An inspection of leader development between April 2014 and January 2015 found that leaders at all levels struggled to find the time for and the right balance of mission training requirements, leader development, and mandated training.  An  inspection  of  the  Army  Substance  Abuse  Program between March and June 2015 found a number of systemic oversights causing significant stress on the program's clinics Army-wide.

The Inspector General, on behalf of the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army, directs Inspector General compliance inspections based on requirements contained in statutes, policies, and regulations. These inspections assess a specific organization's adherence to relevant statutes, DoD policy, Army regulations, and Army policies. In  FY  2015,  the  U.S.  Army  Inspector  General  Agency  conducted over 100 compliance inspections. Inspector General policy generally prohibits  discussion  of  specific  findings  associated  with  compliance inspections.

From the beginning of FY 2013 to the end of FY 2015 there were 1,949 allegations of misconduct made against 1,725 senior officials. In this case, the term 'senior official' refers to promotable colonels, general officers, Senior Executive Service members, and all colonels that are cosubjects in an inspector general senior official investigation. During these two years, there were 152 substantiated allegations made against 110  subjects.  The  most  numerous  type  of  substantiated  allegation was failure  to  take  appropriate  action.  This  allegation  is  defined  as when a leader was aware of alleged misconduct by a subordinate and the  leader  failed  to  take  action  to  address  the  alleged  misconduct.

The second most frequent substantiated allegation was failure to obey an order or regulation. The third most substantiated allegation was failure to treat subordinates with dignity and respect. The fourth most substantiated allegation was misuse of military personnel.

## Provost Marshal General

The Office of the Provost Marshal General established a public website  listing  the  most  wanted  fugitive  deserters.  The  purpose  of the website is to assist in apprehending the most dangerous of these deserters, those charged with violent crimes. The entry on each deserter is  similar  to  that  of  other  law  enforcement  agencies'  most-wanted lists. The site links to the Criminal Investigation Command's existing 'Wanted by CID' page.

The  Army  Law  Enforcement  Reporting  and  Tracking  System became operational on 1 April 2015.  The  system  combines  the  law enforcement  reporting  systems  used  by  the  Criminal  Investigative Division and the Military Police Corps into a unified case management system  for  reports  on  felony  crimes  and  reports  on  misdemeanor crimes. The new system standardizes reporting mechanisms, reduces redundant data, and allows the Criminal Investigative Division and the Military Police Corps to share information quickly.

## Army Audit Agency

The Army Audit Agency identified four field offices for closure in FY 2015 and FY 2016. It closed its Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and Fort Knox, Kentucky, field offices in FY 2015; it will close its Fort Benning and Fort Hood field offices in FY 2016.

The  agency  assessed Army  programs  and  functions  on  an enterprise level. It identified ten risk areas for audit focus: acquisition, audit  readiness,  contracting,  financial  management,  health  of  the force, human  capital, installations, intelligence, protection, and sustainment. During the fiscal year, the agency published 105 reports with $1.3 billion in potential monetary benefits.

## Civil Works

After  Hurricane  Sandy  in  2012,  the  Corps  of  Engineers  began a comprehensive study of flood risks in the coastal zone of its North Atlantic Division. In January 2015, it published the Hurricane Sandy Comprehensive  Study.  The  study  presented  a  Coastal  Storm  Risk Management Framework that states and localities can use to identify

site-specific problems, needs, and opportunities. The framework identified a set of structural, nonstructural, and programmatic measures to manage risk and promote resilience for approximately 31,000 miles of coastline, from New Hampshire to Virginia. The study also provides various tools that can expedite and enhance future studies. All future North Atlantic coastal studies will undergo a thorough review to ensure they are consistent with the tenets of the study.

As part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, the Army completed the Central Everglades Planning Project. This project developed  a  plan,  known  as  a  Project  Implementation  Report,  for restoration projects in the central Everglades that will capture water that currently is being lost to tides and send it instead to the Everglades and Florida Bay. The Corps of Engineers prepared the project using a pilot process designed to reduce the overall time for a study of this magnitude. In prior years, plan formulation and review may have taken six years or longer, but the Corps completed the Central Everglades Planning Project in half that time. The Army transmitted the report to the Congress for authorization and appropriations.

The  outer  harbor  phase  of  the  Savannah  Harbor  Expansion Project  began  in  September  2015.  Deepening  the  harbor  will  allow larger, Neopanamax cargo vessels to call on the port with fewer tidal restrictions.  This  phase  will  extend  the  entrance  channel  by  7  miles and deepen the outer harbor from approximately Fort Pulaski for 18.5 miles into the Atlantic Ocean. Dredging the outer harbor is the first step to deepening the entire 40-mile shipping channel and harbor from the ocean to the Georgia Ports Authority terminal in Garden City.

The Corps of Engineers, in collaboration with a federal interagency team,  released  a  revised  version  of Synchronizing  Environmental Reviews  for  Transportation  and  Other  Infrastructure  Projects , also known as the Red Book. This new Red Book does not contain any new policy or guidance. Rather, it describes how agencies can apply existing  regulations,  guidance,  and  policy  to  maximize  efficiency  by having  agency  reviews  run  concurrently.  It  also  includes  the  use  of dedicated transportation and infrastructure liaisons, development of programmatic approaches, and use of a watershed-scale approach to mitigation. The new Red Book replaces an edition published in 1988.

## Environmental Protection

The Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency finalized the Clean Water Rule. This final rule does not establish any regulatory requirements. Instead, it is a definitional rule that clarifies the scope of 'waters of the United States' consistent with the Clean

Water Act, U.S. Supreme Court precedent, and science. The final rule also reflects consideration of the extensive public comments received on the proposed rule. The rule became effective on 28 August 2015.

The Army's environmental restoration program reduces the risks to  human  health  and  the  environment  at  active  installations  and Base  Closure  and  Realignment  facilities.  It  also  ensures  that  Army environmental cleanup programs conform to DoD policy. In FY 2015, the Army reached the DoD environmental restoration goal of achieving 'Response Complete' at 90 percent of all sites, three years earlier than the projected date. The service continues working toward meeting the DoD goal of achieving 'Response Complete' at 95 percent of all sites by the end of FY 2021.

## Chemical Weapons Demilitarization

In  1997,  the  United  States  entered  into  the  Chemical  Weapons Convention,  an  international  treaty  requiring  the  destruction  of chemical  weapons.  The  U.S.  Army  Pueblo  Chemical  Depot  in Colorado holds 2,600 tons of mustard agent in about 780,000 artillery shells.  In  2012,  the  Army  completed  the  Pueblo  Chemical  AgentDestruction Pilot Plant, which used an automated process to destroy munitions. However, some of the shells are leaking or are otherwise damaged, making it unsafe to neutralize them in the plant's automated process. In March 2015, the depot began processing these shells with the Explosive Destruction System, which uses explosives to tear open the shells and chemicals to neutralize the mustard agent. Destruction of the remaining shells is expected to begin in FY 2016 and the depot expects to have all munitions destroyed by 2019.

## Legal

In FY 2015, there were 1,819 active component attorneys in the Judge Advocate General Corps. (This total does not include sixty-nine officers attending law school while participating in the Army's Funded Legal Education Program.) Among the active component attorneys, there  were  114  African  Americans,  57  Hispanics,  and  109  Asian Americans  and  Native  Americans.  Around  27  percent  (492)  of  the total active component attorneys were women. The attorney strength in the Army Reserve was 1,782 and 906 in the Army National Guard at the end of the fiscal year.

The Military Justice Additional Skill Identifier program continued during the fiscal year. Its purpose is to identify and sustain expertise and to assist in the selection of personnel for key military justice positions.

By the end of FY 2015, 1,286 judge advocates have been awarded skill identifiers: 668 basic, 353 senior, 182 expert, and 83 master military justice practitioners.

Approximately 459 active and reserve component judge advocates served in the U.S. Army Trial Defense Service, including 138 on active duty, 172 assigned to one of three Army Reserve trial defense legal operations detachments, and 149 in the Army National Guard. The service detailed one or more counsel to every Army special and general courts-martial referred in the fiscal year and assisted soldiers facing military  justice-related  adverse  administrative  actions.  The  service's active duty caseload for FY 2015 was 862 special and general courtsmartial; 1,542 administrative boards; 26,699 nonjudicial punishment actions; and 29,077 military justice consultations.

In  FY 2015, 629 records of trial and nearly 1,600 motions and briefs were referred to one of the three judicial panels comprising the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals for judicial review. The average processing time for those courts-martial, from sentencing to convening authority action, was 203 days. In 176 of those cases, the convening authority completed the initial action within the 120 days prescribed by United States v. Moreno .

The  Army's  superior  court  rendered  an  initial  decision  in  537 cases, with an average processing time of 298 days from receipt of the

record of trial by the clerk of court to decision by Army Court of Criminal Appeals. Of the 537 decisions, the superior court rendered 474 within the 18-month period prescribed by United States v Moreno . There  were  no  court-martial  convictions  reversed  due  to  command influence, denial of the right to a speedy review, lost records, or other administrative deficiencies ( Table 15 ).

In FY 2015, there were 33,708 cases where nonjudicial punishment was  imposed  under  Article  15  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military Justice, a rate of 68.60 per 1,000. This was an increase of 10.4 percent from FY 2014.

## Historical Activities

The  National  Museum  of  the  United  States  Army  Project Office,  an  element  of  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the Army  (Installations, Energy and Environment) oversees design and  construction  of  the  National  Museum  of  the  United  States Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Funding for the project comes from nongovernmental  sources  in  accordance  with  a  2009  memorandum of  agreement  which  designated  the  Army  Historical  Foundation  (a member-based, publicly supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization) as  the  official  fund-raising  entity  for  the  project.  In  January  2015, the  foundation  assumed  construction  management  responsibilities. In May, it affiliated with the Association for the United States Army to  accelerate  the  project's  progression.  In  September,  it  awarded the  construction contract. The Army will operate and maintain the museum once it opens in 2019.

## 9 Conclusion

FY  2015  was  a  challenging  year  as  Congress  appropriated $5.1  billion  less  for  the  Army's  base  budget  than  what  the  service spent in FY 2014. The decline in funding marked FY 2015 as similar to  other  postwar  periods  in  the  Army's  history.  Smaller  budgets brought  smaller  authorized  strengths.  To  reach  those  strengths,  the service implemented a precision retention strategy and convened early retirement, qualitative service programs, and qualitative management program  boards  to  involuntarily  separate  Regular  Army  personnel. Regular Army force structure also declined during the year, with six BCTs and three combat aviation brigades inactivating. To ensure that a  portion  of  its  Regular  Army  force  structure  remained  prepared for  contingency  operations,  the  service  turned  to  a  tiered  readiness system  in  which  only  the  units  of  the  Army  Contingency  Force received the resources necessary to reach a full state of readiness. The service completed planning for reorganizing HQDA and MEDCOM to optimize their effectiveness in a time of fewer resources. Another feature  of  postwar  periods,  increased  tension  between  the  Regular Army  and  the  reserve  components,  led  Congress  to  establish  the National Commission on the Future of the Army and the commission began its work in FY 2015.

The  service  in  FY  2015  also  looked  to  the  future.  As  part  of that  effort,  it  published  the  Army  Operating  Concept,  the  Army Equipment Modernization Strategy, the Army Network Campaign Plan, and the Energy Security and Sustainability Strategy. Adoption of  the  Sustainable  Readiness  Model  will  provide  a  more  effective method for meeting the demand for units across a range of diverse missions. The establishment of an Army University will increase the rigor of the service's educational programs. The opening of all MOSs to  women will  produce  better  talent  management  of  soldiers.  The Enterprise Army Brand marketing strategy will improve recruiting. First Army continued its Bold Shift restructuring to enhance reserve components readiness.

The current postwar period, however, is unlike previous ones in that the demand for Army forces remained high. The size of the Army's commitment in Afghanistan remained stable even with the transition from Operation endurIng Freedom to Operation Freedom'S

SenTInel . The establishment of Operation InherenT reSolve , however,  brought  an  increase  in  the  number  of  soldiers  deployed to  Iraq.  The  Pacific  Pathways  initiative  required  a  steady  supply  of Army units for its exercises. The Army also began programs to rotate an armored BCT and a multiple-launch rocket system battalion from the United States to Korea. Two other rotation programs, to support Operation aTlanTIC reSolve with an armored BCT and an aviation battalion  task  force,  also  began  in  FY  2015.  Southern  Command continued to require both active and reserve component units for its joint  task  forces  and  its  partner  training  missions.  The  response  to the Ebola outbreak through Operation unITed aSSISTanCe in Liberia demonstrated the utility of Army forces for short-notice contingency deployment. Mobilization for active duty in the combatant commands continued  for  reserve  component  units  and  governors  continued  to mobilize  their  Army  National  Guard  units  for  active  service  in  the states and territories.

FY 2015 ended without an approved budget for FY 2016 even as the Army worked to meet the demand for its capabilities from combatant commands and it sought to reshape the force for the postwar period. Adding to the uncertainty of the new fiscal year was the possibility that the FY 2016 budget when finally approved would include sequestration cuts requiring even more reductions in authorized personnel strength and force structure.
