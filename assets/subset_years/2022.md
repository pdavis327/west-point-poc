## DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY HISTORICAL SUMMARY

FISCAL YEAR 2022

## 1 Introduction

As  fiscal  year  (FY)  2022  began,  the  coronavirus  disease  2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continued  to  affect  the  Army.  Mitigation measures  and  the  fielding  of  vaccines  had  enabled  the  Army  to resume  many  activities  in  FY  2021,  but  mutations  in  the  virus created new, large outbreaks that required the Army, and especially the Army National Guard (ARNG), to assist civil authorities.

In  FY  2022,  the  Army  faced  the  by-then  common  state  of beginning the fiscal year without an approved budget. The demand from  combatant  commands  for  Army  forces  remained  high  even after the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in late FY 2021. The service's highest priority remained modernization-in materiel, doctrine, talent management, and organization-to prepare for largescale combat operations. As part of that modernization, the Army, in FY 2022, continued to change policies, processes, and programs to improve its ability to build diverse, adaptive, and cohesive teams.

## Organization, Management, and Budget

## Organizational Changes

The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022 required each military department to appoint a special trial counsel. In July 2022, the  Army  established  the  Office  of  Special  Trial  Counsel.  When it is fully operational, it will have exclusive authority to prosecute the  following  offenses:  murder,  manslaughter,  rape  and  sexual assault of an adult or a child, other sexual misconduct, kidnapping, domestic  violence,  stalking,  retaliation,  child  pornography,  and wrongful broadcast.

Initially, the Office of Special Trial Counsel was established as a field operating agency of the Office of The Judge Advocate General. This  office  is  responsible  for  identifying  and  certifying  personnel for assignment to the office, which will include 159 personnel in FY 2023 and will grow to 180 by FY 2025. This will include fifty-three litigation billets for judge advocates certified as special trial counsel. No later than 31 August 2023, the Office of Special Trial Counsel will  operate  under  the  supervision  of  the  special  trial  counsel, which will report directly to the secretary of the Army. The office is expected to be fully operational by December 2023.

During the fiscal year, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army underwent several organizational changes. In October 2021, the Civilian Senior Leader Management Office came under the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Manpower and  Reserve  Affairs).  That  same  month,  the  U.S.  Army  Test  and Evaluation  Office  moved  to  the  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of the Army. Also in October, the Army Science Board became part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA [ALT]).

In August 2022, the Civilian Senior Leader Management Office returned to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army,

without  its  Civilian  Leader  Development  Division,  which  moved to  the  U.S.  Army  Civilian  Human  Resources  Agency.  That  same month, the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Office also reverted to the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Army.

There were two organizational changes in the Office of the ASA (ALT). The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Policy, and Logistics) became the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  (Sustainment),  reflecting  the increased importance of sustainment considerations in all phases of the Army's acquisition process. Functional areas of responsibility for the office include product support planning and policy, sustainment integration  planning  and  oversight,  industrial  base  policy  and oversight, program protection planning and oversight, and supply chain risk management. The Army redesignated the chief systems engineer  as  the  deputy  assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (data, engineering, and software) to emphasize the growing significance of data, engineering, and software throughout a program's life cycle.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy, and Environment) established the Army Climate Directorate in  December  2021.  The  new  organization  develops  policy  and provides  implementation  guidance  regarding  the  service's  climate strategy. It took on the roles and responsibilities of the Army Climate Change Working Group, which had been set up in March 2021.

The Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army transferred several subordinate elements, aligning these functions with organizations that have similar missions. The Army Multimedia and Visual Information Directorate moved to the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, and the Motor Pool Transportation Directorate  went  to  the  Washington  Headquarters  Services.  The Military  Air  and  Executive  Air  Travel  program  shifted  to  the Military District of Washington's U.S. Army Aviation Brigade.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-1,  transferred  the Civilian Personnel Evaluation and Analysis Agency, which remained at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army  (Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs).  The  Soldier  For  Life program moved from the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1,

to  U.S.  Army  Training  and  Doctrine  Command  but  remained  in its Arlington, Virginia, location. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, established the Soldier and Family Readiness Directorate, which was tasked with supporting quality-of-life initiatives.

In April 2022, the Office of Soldiers' Counsel transferred from U.S.  Army  Medical  Command  (MEDCOM)  to  the  Army  Legal Services  Agency.  The  organization  provides  legal  assistance  to soldiers in the Army's disability evaluation system from the initiation of  the  Medical  Evaluation  Board  through  final  review  by  the Physical Evaluation Board and separation or return to duty. It also assists soldiers who do not concur with their proposed Department of Veterans Affairs disability ratings for medical conditions found to be unfitting by the Physical Evaluation Board.

## Management

A November 2021 Army directive changed the military  cochairs and clarified responsibilities for program objective memorandum program  evaluation  groups  ( Table  1 ). In 2018,  Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), had assigned commanders of Army major commands as the military cochairs, with management and  day-to-day  operations  for  each  group  provided  by  an  office of the Army Staff. In FY 2022, an Army Staff deputy chief of staff became the military cochair for each group. The major command commanders shifted to an advisory role for each group. The civilian cochairs, who are assistant secretaries of the Army, did not change.

With advice from the Army major commands, each group works with the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army to build the annual draft program objective memorandum. Army  major  commands  review  it  and  provide  an  assessment of  risk.  The  Program  Analysis  and  Evaluation  Directorate  in  the Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-8,  then  leads  an  overall program  objective  memorandum  enterprise  assessment.  Finally, the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army present the program objective memorandum to the secretary of the Army for approval.

In August 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-8, held the  first  HQDA  Requirements  Summit.  The  participants  included representatives from the Army Staff, the Army Secretariat, Army major commands,  and  Army  service  component  commands.  The  summit examined improvements for the new Army Capabilities Integration and Development System modernization process. Attendees discussed topics such as operational utility assessments, capability needs statements,  cost  estimating,  and  updating  Army  Regulation  71-9, Warfighting Capabilities Determination .

In October 2021, the Army tested an integrated management system course  for  senior  leaders.  This  system  facilitates  the  integration  of people,  processes,  data,  and  information  to  better  manage  business operations. In the course, students learn how to assess their organization's operations and develop recommendations for improvement. In September 2022, nineteen students completed the course, which the Office of Business Transformation conducts semiannually.

In  FY  2022,  the  Business  Process  Reengineering  Center  of Excellence at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, graduated 118

students from its Tier One foundation course and 66 students from its  Tier  Two  intermediate course, while 15 students attained Tier Three advanced certification.

In  FY  2022,  14,700  Army  personnel  participated  in  1,234 conferences at a total cost of $17.6 million. The Army hosted thirtynine of these conferences.

## Information Management

In  October  2021,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Information  Officer published  the Army  Digital  Transformation  Strategy . The Army Modernization Strategy had identified digital transformation and  the  modernization  of  the  Army's  underlying  network  and computer  infrastructure  as  crucial  to  modernizing  the  service. Digital transformation is a shift in operations and culture through the  adoption  of  advanced  technologies  such  as  cloud,  data,  and artificial  intelligence.  It  establishes  an  outcomes-based,  metricsdriven mindset to measure activities and to seek efficiencies and effectiveness.

The strategy has three objectives. First, between 2021 and 2028, the  service  will  converge  current  digital  initiatives  that  support readiness and modernization into a single integrated plan; make them  available  from  small  units  to  the  entire  enterprise;  and establish standardized delivery processes, methods, and tools, all of which will use the cloud as an enabler. This objective has six lines of effort. Second, the Army will maintain pace with advancements in  relevant  technologies  by  optimizing  its  resources  and  making data-driven investment decisions that are aligned directly with the service's  priorities.  This  objective  has  four  lines  of  effort.  Third, transformation requires the Army to change how it recruits, trains, and retains those who work with these technologies and to improve its collaboration with allies, academia, and industry. This objective has three lines of effort.

The Army Enterprise Service Management Platform program is a joint venture of U.S. Army Cyber Command, Program Executive Office  Enterprise  Information  Systems,  and  U.S.  Army  Network

Enterprise Technology  Command.  It  encompasses  an  Armywide  global  unclassified  and  classified,  cloud-based,  information technology  service  and  provides  the  platform  and  operations  for the  Army  Enterprise  Service  Desk.  In  September  2022,  U.S.  Army Contracting  Command-Rock  Island  awarded  a  single,  indefinitedelivery, indefinite-quantity contract for the platform.

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014  requires  an  annual  independent  evaluation  to  determine the  effectiveness  of  every  agency's  information  security  program and  practices.  The  Army,  in  FY  2022,  received  a  92  percent  score for  authorized  systems,  a  drop  of  6  percent  from  FY  2021.  The Department of Defense (DoD) threshold is a score of 95 percent. The Office of the Chief Information Officer and the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-6, are working to reduce the number of systems that do not have valid authorizations to operate so as to meet or exceed the 95 percent mandate in FY 2023.

In FY 2022, the Army  continued working on zero-trust cybersecurity, building on Network Enterprise Technology Command's test of this concept in FY 2020. This zero-trust model eliminates  implicit  trust  in  any  one  element  and  instead  requires continuous  verification  via  real-time  information  from  multiple sources to determine access and other system responses. If a device is  compromised,  the  zero-trust  system  will  contain  the  damage  to a network. In January 2022, the Office of Management and Budget issued  a  federal  zero-trust  architecture  strategy,  which  required agencies to meet specific cybersecurity standards and objectives by the  end  of  FY  2024.  That  same  month,  HQDA 's  chief  information officer established a zero-trust working group for sharing information on lessons learned from testing, demonstrations, proofs of concepts, and pilot deployments. The group also recommends appropriate use of resources to implement the service's plans for establishing zerotrust architecture.

The  Office  of  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  G-2,  deployed  the first  Army  system  of  record  in  the  National  Security  Agency's Commercial Solutions for Classified program that adapts commercial products for military secure networking operations.

It  also  was  the  first  system  of  record  to  go  through  the  Risk Management  Framework  assessment  and  authorization  process and the first to go through a full adversarial assessment.

The Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems and the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, continued to develop a new data platform for making force-structure decisions to replace  fourteen  existing  systems.  The  project's  first  phase ended in May 2022. It examined prototypes to integrate planning, programming,  and  production  functions  of  six  existing  systems. The second phase began in September 2022 and will conclude in June  2023.  It  will  deliver  a  minimum  viable  product,  focused  on the capabilities required for developing the future force, as well as products  required  for  mobilization  and  deploy-to-redeploy  and retrograde activities.

The Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems' Global  Enterprise  Network  Modernization  -  Americas  product office  began  its  first  network  and  infrastructure  modernization of  unclassified  and  classified  systems  on  an  Army  post  in  the continental  United  States  at  Fort  Belvoir. The  modernization includes  adding  wireless  connection  to  the  internet,  converting telephone service to internet-based connections, and connecting all Army technical control facilities into the Department of Defense Information  Network.  The  project  completed  its  first  step  with  a survey in September 2022. The next milestone is the assembly and deployment of core devices, scheduled to take place in January 2023.

In FY 2021, the service began a three-phase transition to Army 365, a secure, cloud-based suite of products that merges Microsoft Office applications with voice, video, chat, and file-sharing capabilities. The first phase ended in June 2021 when the service's Microsoft Teams environments moved from the commercial virtual remote service to Army 365. The second phase, moving Army email accounts from the Defense Enterprise Email system to Army 365, began in July 2021 with an expected completion date of 31 March 2022. The third phase, transitioning all SharePoint environments to the Army 365 SharePoint online application, began late in FY 2021, with completion expected by the end of FY 2022.

The Army did not complete its transition to Army 365 as planned. In FY 2021, the service had decided to purchase only 950,000 Army 365 licenses, which were not enough to provide access to the system for all soldiers, civilian employees, and contractors. By the end of that fiscal year, the Army had not determined how personnel not covered by a license could use email and other applications in Army 365. In March 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-6, announced a  bridging  strategy  that  extended  access  to  the  Defense  Enterprise Email system until the end of FY 2022 for personnel without an Army 365  license.  To  ensure  organizations  would  not  lose  functionality or  data,  HQDA  extended  the  SharePoint  migration  deadline  into FY 2023.

During FY 2022, the Army continued reducing its use of data centers  to  support  the Army Digital  Transformation  Strategy and the Army Unified  Network  Plan .  Through  the  Army  Data  Center Consolidation Program, the service closed or redesignated twenty facilities. This produced cost savings of approximately $6.3 million. At the end of FY 2022, the Army had closed 742 of what had been a total of 1,102 data centers at the start of the program in 2016.

The Army Declassification Directorate reviewed more than 4.2 million pages of permanent, classified records for declassification. This  exceeded  the  amount  reviewed  in  FY  2021 by more than 800,000 pages. The Army declassified more than 75 percent of the records reviewed in FY 2022.

## Audits

An  independent  public  accounting  firm  conducted  the  FY  2022 annual audits of the Army General Fund and the Army Working Capital Fund  financial  statements. Both  audits  resulted in a disclaimer  of  opinion  by  the  firm  because  it  could  not  conclude whether the service presented the financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The firm concluded that the Army did not provide sufficient evidence to support the information in the financial statements because of inadequate processes, controls, and records to support transactions

and account balances. The audit revealed fourteen General Fund and  fifteen  Working  Capital  Fund  material  weaknesses  related to  the  Army's  financial  reporting  processes  and  internal  control environment. These results are consistent with prior years.

In January  2022,  the  secretary  of  the Army  published  a memorandum on the need for accountability and fiscal stewardship. To focus efforts on moving the service from a disclaimer to a sustained unmodified  audit  opinion,  the  secretary  directed  the  assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial  management  and  comptroller) to establish an audit committee. The committee, cochaired by the undersecretary of the Army and the vice chief of staff of the Army, is composed of all assistant secretaries and commanding generals from major commands. It meets quarterly. The secretary also directed the inclusion of audit metrics into the Command Accountability and Execution Review program. Additionally, the assistant secretary of the Army (financial management and comptroller), in collaboration with  responsible  officials in each  business  area, developed  a multiyear plan for remediating the major audit issues. The assistant secretary  of  the  Army  (financial  management  and  comptroller) reports quarterly on the progress of organizations and individuals to meet their milestones in the plan. The Army expects to obtain an audit opinion for the Army Working Capital Fund in FY 2026 and for the Army General Fund in FY 2027.

## Budget

The Army's FY 2022 budget request was aligned with the Interim National  Security  Strategic  Guidance  and  supported  the  Army's focus on  people, readiness, and  modernization  ( Table 2 ). It provided for a Regular Army (RA) of 485,000, an ARNG of 336,000, a U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) of 189,500, and a civilian workforce of 196,710. Compared to the FY 2021 enacted appropriations, FY 2022  appropriations  for  procurement  and  research,  development, test, and  evaluation  decreased.  The  request  resourced  current capabilities and applied intentional production delays to focus on the six  modernization  priorities  and  the  signature  efforts  set  out  in  the

Army  Modernization  Strategy .  This  focus  will  permit  the  service  to begin fielding next-generation capabilities by 2028.

Unlike previous years' budgets, the FY 2022 budget did not have a separate request for overseas contingency operations. Instead, funding for  these  operations was included in the base budget request and is identified  as  either  a  direct  war  cost  or  an  enduring  cost  ( Table  3 ). Direct war costs included support for Operation Freedom's Sentinel and Operation Inherent Resolve along with separate appropriations for  Afghan  security  forces  and  for  training  and  equipping  forces opposing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Enduring costs included the European Deterrence Initiative and activities, both in a theater of operations and in the continental United States, that will continue after combat operations.

At the end of FY 2021, Congress had not approved the Army's budget for FY 2022. Instead, the service operated from continuing resolutions  that  provided  funding  allocations  pegged  to  FY  2021enacted  levels.  Operating  under  a  continuing  resolution  placed restrictions on new starts, ongoing program expansions, production rate increases, and the reprogramming of funds.

In March 2022, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2022,  providing  the  Army  a  budget  of  $174.7  billion  for  FY 2022 ( Tables 4 and 5 ). The only major change between the requested and enacted budgets was the deletion of the Afghanistan Security Forces  Fund  after  the  Taliban  came  to  power  in  FY  2021.  Other changes included increases of $397 million for RA operations and maintenance; $489 million for aircraft procurement; $443 million for weapons and tracked combat vehicle procurement; $1.7 billion for  research,  development, test, and evaluation; and $999 million for RA military construction.

The service received approximately $1.3 billion in Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funding. The largest portion of this amount, $863 million, was for the Army's operation and maintenance account. The service internally reprogrammed more than $2.86 billion throughout the year to meet operational demands. In FY 2022, the Army received two supplemental appropriations because of the war in Ukraine. The first provided $3.2 billion for expenses incurred by the service in deploying units to Europe. The second provided $5.2 billion to replenish weapons and munitions given to Ukraine.

By the end of FY 2022, the Army had executed 99 percent of both  its  military  personnel  appropriations  and  its  operation  and maintenance  appropriations.  The  Army  achieved  an  80.2  percent execution rate in operation and maintenance appropriations through

31  July  2022,  complying  with  the  congressional  requirement  that federal  agencies  execute  no  more  than  20  percent  of  their  budget in the last two months of the fiscal year. During FY 2022, the Army funded  $1.5  billion  in  operation  and  maintenance  unfinanced requirements by reprioritizing requirements, identifying resources for realignment, and accessing DoD-provided funding. Among the funded unfinanced requirements were activation of the 11th Airborne Division's  headquarters,  U.S.  Army  Pacific's  Operation  Pathways, long-haul communications and information technology shortfalls, operations  on  the  Mexican  border,  and  a  shortfall  in  military pay accounts.

In the FY 2022-2024 procurement appropriation, the service had obligated 60.8 percent of the available allotment against the 80 percent goal set by DoD for the first year of availability. The Army did not meet this goal because it did not receive these appropriations until 11 March 2022, and it concentrated on executing the FY 20212023 procurement appropriation. For this appropriation, the Army exceeded DoD's standard of 90 percent obligation in the second year of availability by 3.3 percent. The Army executed its expiring FY 2020-2022 procurement appropriation at 99.7 percent. It disbursed 40.2 percent of its FY 2022 research, development, test, and evaluation appropriation against the 55 percent goal set by DoD. The service disbursed  80.8  percent  of  its  expiring  FY  2021  appropriation  in this account.

In the FY 2022-2026 military construction, Army, appropriation, the service awarded contracts for five of thirty-two projects for a total of $110.2 million. The twenty-seven remaining projects were not awarded because of the effects of inflation or environmental, site, or solicitation issues. They are scheduled to be awarded in FY 2023 or FY 2024. Unobligated funding in the amount of $1.7 billion is available for the remaining FY 2022 projects, adjustments to prior year projects, minor construction projects, contingencies, contract adjustments,  and  for  reprogramming  to  other  RA  construction projects in the event of cost growth. In the FY 2018-2022 military construction, Army, appropriation, twenty-nine of thirty projects were awarded for a total of $1.115 billion. The remaining project

(an uncrewed aerial vehicle hangar) was a source for the 10 U.S. Code § 2808 reprogramming for the Mexican border wall project in FY 2019. After restoration of the project's funding in FY 2021, and  because  the  FY  2023  National  Defense  Authorization  Act provided an extension of authorization for the project, a contract for it is expected to be awarded in FY 2024.

In the FY 2022-2026 military construction, ARNG, appropriation,  the  service  awarded  contracts  for  two  of  five projects. The three remaining projects were not awarded because of  environmental,  site,  or  solicitation  issues,  or  because  a  priorapproval  reprogramming  was  required.  In  the  FY  2018-2022 military  construction  appropriation  for  the  ARNG,  all  thirteen projects were awarded. In the FY 2022-2026 military construction appropriation  for  the  USAR,  the  service  awarded  contracts  for one of five projects. The four remaining projects were not awarded because of environmental, site, or solicitation issues, or because a prior-approval reprogramming was required. In the FY 2018-2022 military  construction  appropriation  for  the  USAR,  the  service awarded contracts for six projects.

The Army awarded $24.59 billion in prime contracts to small businesses  in  FY  2022,  which  was  25.47  percent  of  total  prime contracts against the assigned goal of 26.60 percent. It exceeded the goal of increasing prime contract awards to small, disadvantaged businesses. The service awarded $13.62 billion of these contracts, which was 14.11 percent of prime contracts against the assigned goal of 12.28 percent.

The  Army  Working  Capital  Fund  consists  of  two  activity groups:  supply  management  and  industrial  operations.  The  first group  buys  and  manages  spare  and  repair  parts  for  sale  to  its customers,  primarily  Army  operating  units.  The  second  group provides the Army an organic industrial capability. The fund uses a revolving fund concept, relying on revenue from sales to finance operations rather than direct appropriations from Congress. The Army did request some direct appropriations for the fund to meet mobilization  and  wartime  surge  requirements.  At  the  start  of  FY 2022, the fund's cash balance of $1.7 billion was within its operating

requirement limits. It ended the fiscal year with a cash balance of $3 billion, which is above the upper operating range. The change in cash is the result of receiving $499.7 million in direct appropriations, and  a  net  increase  in  cash  of  $787.7  million  in  the  fund's  two activity groups.

The FY 2023 budget request continues to support the service's focus on people, readiness, and modernization ( Tables 6 and 7 ). It provides  for  an  RA  of  473,000,  an  ARNG  of  336,000,  a  USAR  of 189,500, and a civilian workforce of 196,897. The Army will fund twenty-two  brigade-level  combat  training  center  rotations  and establish a third multidomain task force in FY 2023.

Beginning with the FY 2023 President's Budget, direct war and enduring costs in the base budget are identified instead as overseas operations costs. Overseas operations costs include in-country war support for Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria and for training and equipping forces opposing the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Enduring costs included the European Deterrence Initiative and activities, both in a theater of operations and in the continental United States, that will continue after combat operations.

The  Army  began  FY  2023  without  an  approved  budget.  The congressional continuing resolution that enabled the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2022 levels. The

continuing resolution did not extend defense emergency funding for natural disasters or response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Personnel

## The Army People Strategy

In October 2019, HQDA  released  the Army  People Strategy , a commitment to refining personnel management and a new leadership approach focused on attaining and retaining top talent in a dynamic labor market. The strategy articulates how the Army must modernize its personnel management programs in order to compete with the private sector for talent.

During FY 2022, Army leaders focused on coordinating and refining the Army People Strategy . In January 2022, the inaugural Army People Synchronization  Conference  gathered  representatives  of  the  Army Secretariat,  the  Army  Staff,  Army  major  commands,  Army  service component  commands,  and  direct  reporting  units.  The  conference examined policies and processes to acquire, retain, develop, and employ personnel  during  the  transition  to  the  Army  of  2030.  The  attendees focused on how the Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model (ReARMM) will generate future requirements while sustaining readiness.  In  August  2022,  the  second  Army  People  Synchronization Conference explored the same subjects. In September 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, began a monthly Army People Seminar to educate high-potential officers, noncommissioned officers (NCOs), and  civilians  about  talent  management.  A  University  of  Louisville facilitator  led  the  seminar,  and  sessions  featured  senior  military  and corporate experts from human resource and talent management fields. Additionally, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, created the Army People Strategy Civilian Implementation Program for FY 20232025 to improve recruitment and retention of civilian employees.

## Army Strength and Distribution

On 30 September 2022, the Army's three components totaled 971,501 soldiers, a reduction of 36,872 compared to the end of the previous

fiscal year. Midway through the fiscal year, HQDA cut the authorized end strength of the RA by 12,000, from 485,000 to 473,000. At the end of FY 2022, the RA nevertheless fell short of this new ceiling with an actual strength of 465,625: 78,620 commissioned officers, 15,041  warrant  officers,  367,585  enlisted  soldiers,  and  4,379  U.S. Military Academy cadets. The strength of the ARNG was 329,705: 37,982 commissioned officers, 8,959 warrant officers, and 282,764 enlisted soldiers. This was nearly 6,300 below its authorized strength. The  USAR stood at  176,171:  35,451  commissioned  officers,  3,536 warrant officers, and 137,184 enlisted soldiers. This was more than 5,100 below its authorized strength. Women constituted 16 percent of the RA, 19 percent of the ARNG, and 25 percent of the USAR. Racial  and  ethnic  minorities  constituted  46  percent  of  the  RA, 36 percent of the ARNG, and 51 percent of the USAR. At the Military Academy, 23 percent of cadets were women and 37 percent were racial or ethnic minorities.

## Officers

In FY 2022, the Army accessioned 13,421 new officers. The Reserve Officer Training Corps, with 6,256 officers, accounted for the largest share with 3,925 joining the RA, 1,467 joining the ARNG, and 864 joining the USAR. The Reserve Officer Training Corps Educational Delay/Early Commissioning Program commissioned another 173 officers: 162 into the RA and 11 into the USAR. The Military Academy produced 1,034 officers: 1,020 for the RA and 14 for the ARNG. The in-service Officer Candidate School commissioned 612 lieutenants: 480 in the RA and 132 in the USAR. The college-option Officer Candidate School program produced 781 lieutenants: 400 for the RA, 165 for the ARNG, and 216 for the USAR. The ARNG's statebased and federal Officer Candidate School programs commissioned another 554 officers.

This  fiscal  year  there  were  2,779  direct  commissions.  Ninetyfour joined one of the Army's basic branches: 3 in the RA, 86 in the ARNG, and 5 in the USAR. The Judge Advocate General's Corps accepted 181 officers: 132 RA, 28 ARNG, and 21 USAR. The U.S.

Army  Medical  Department  gained  2,116  officers:  1,319  RA,  247 ARNG, and 550 USAR. The Chaplain Corps took 388 officers: 105 RA, 75 ARNG, and 208 USAR. Another 447 officers, 405 RA and 42 USAR, commissioned into the Medical Service Corps and Army Nurse  Corps  through  the  Military  Academy  or  Reserve  Officer Training  Corps.  The  Army  accessioned  785  officers,  45  RA  and 740 ARNG, through the Call to Active Duty Program, Interservice Transfer Program, and other programs.

The diversity of officers in the active component was similar to previous fiscal years ( Table 8 ).

The officer diversity in the reserve components also was similar to previous years ( Tables 9 and 10 ).

In the RA commissioned officer corps, 48 percent of company grade  officers  and  87  percent  of  field  grade  officers  were  married. Eighty-one percent of RA warrant officers were married. Additionally, 28 percent of RA company grade officers and 74 percent of field grade officers had children. Seventy-two percent of RA warrant officers had children.

In the ARNG commissioned officer corps, 47 percent of company grade  officers  and  84  percent  of  field  grade  officers  were  married. Seventy-five percent of ARNG  warrant  officers  were  married. Additionally,  37  percent  of  ARNG  company  grade  officers  and 69 percent of field grade officers had children. Fifty-nine percent of ARNG warrant officers had children.

In the USAR commissioned officer corps, 49 percent of company grade  officers  and  78  percent  of  field  grade  officers  were  married. Seventy-six percent of USAR  warrant officers were married. Additionally,  35  percent  of  USAR  company  grade  officers  and 61 percent of field grade officers had children. Fifty-eight percent of USAR warrant officers had children.

A Talent Based Career Alignment pilot program began at some centers of excellence in FY 2022, with plans to implement it Armywide  by  FY  2024.  The  program  allows  junior  officers  attending  a captains career course to apply for an assured midcareer pathway. If selected for a pathway, an officer will know before graduating from the course the next five to seven years of assignments. The program will  assist  captains  with  identifying  and  achieving  personal  and

professional goals and contribute to retaining the service's best junior officers  by  eliminating  uncertainty  over  how  many  times  they  will have to move during this period.

The  Army  confronted  a  growing  shortage  of  warrant  officers, who make up 3 percent of the Army but have important roles in a number  of  career  management  fields.  During  FY  2022,  the  Army Talent Management Task Force implemented the measures of three Army directives approved in FY 2021 to produce and retain more warrant officers. Army Directive 2021-19 established a pilot program enabling senior NCOs to become warrant officers. Although the pilot program only applied to special forces, it may expand to include other career management fields. Army Directive 2021-28 allowed retired RA warrant officers to join the ARNG or the USAR. Army Directive 2021-31  ended  the  automatic  promotion  of  RA  aviator  warrant officers to chief warrant officer two after two years as a warrant officer one. Instead, their date of rank as a warrant officer one will begin after they have completed flight school and the Warrant Officer Basic Course. This change will give these aviators more time for professional development before promotion.

The Command Assessment Program continued in FY 2022. The third iteration of the Battalion Command Assessment Program had 721  Army  officers  plus  5  officers  from  other  services.  The  second iteration  of  the  Colonel  Command  Assessment  Program  saw  284 officers participate. The second iteration of the Medical Command Assessment Program expanded to 58 officers. The second iteration of the Acquisition Leader Assessment Program included 107 officers and civilians. The first iterations of the Division Chaplain Assessment Program and the Colonel Chaplain Assessment Program took place with 20 and 10 participants, respectively.

In FY 2022, the Army had its worst recruiting year since the start of the all-volunteer force in 1973. Despite cutting its recruiting goal by 15,000 halfway through the fiscal year, the RA still fell short by 15,000, missing 25 percent of the revised objective and 40 percent of

the fiscal year's original goal. The ARNG and the USAR also missed their goals for recruits by substantial margins: 13,600 or 35 percent and 5,700 or 39 percent, respectively ( Table 11 ).

From the beginning of the fiscal year, the Army faced an uphill battle  in  recruiting.  The  service  considers  a  delayed  entry  pool of  15,000  to  20,000  at  the  start  of  the  fiscal  year  optimal,  but  in October 2021 it had only 6,500. In January 2022, the Army raised the maximum total of enlistment bonuses to a record $50,000 for highly  skilled  recruits  in  certain  specialties  who  enlisted  for  six years and agreed to start their training immediately.

That same month, U.S. Army Recruiting Command implemented changes that it designated 'mission modernization. ' Each recruiter now received  a  recruiting  quota.  Previously,  recruiting  quotas  had  been assigned  to  each  recruiting  station,  which  enabled  overperforming recruiters  to  make  up  for  underperforming  recruiters.  To  avoid competition, each recruiter was assigned a recruiting zone that did not overlap with other zones. Additionally, in April 2022, Recruiting Command began involuntary extensions of the assignments of more than 260 high-performing recruiters.

In February 2022, the Army offered more short-term enlistment options to attract  people  who were not ready to make a long-term commitment. In March 2022, the service began allowing enlistees in seventeen career management fields to choose their first post from a list that included Fort Carson, Colorado; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Hood, Texas; Fort Polk, Louisiana; Fort  Riley,  Kansas;  Fort  Stewart,  Georgia;  Fort  Drum,  New  York; and all installations in Alaska. By the end of the fiscal year, the list

expanded  to  thirty-two  locations,  including  in  Italy  and  Hawai'i. Eventually, nearly 6,400 recruits picked their first duty station, with 15 percent choosing posts in Alaska.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve  Affairs)  established  the  Accessions/Recruiting  Tiger  Team, which later  became  the  Accessions/Recruiting  Task  Force,  led  by  a major general. The task force assessed more than sixty initiatives to improve Army recruiting in FY 2022 and in future years. In June 2022, Recruiting  Command  introduced  the  '111  Non-Grad'  enlistment program that authorized people with high qualification test scores to enlist without a high school diploma or equivalency. The command suspended this program after less than a week because of controversy about  the  Army  lowering  its  standards.  The  same  month,  Army Directive 2022-09 eased tattoo restrictions as a means of improving both  recruiting  and  retention.  Recruits  and  soldiers  now  can  have small tattoos on their hands, the back of their ears, and the back of their necks.

In August 2022, the Army  established the Future Soldier Preparatory Course pilot program at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, for those on delayed enlistment contracts because of excess body fat or a low score on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. The course has separate  academic and fitness tracks,  each  lasting  three  weeks.  The academic track is modeled after the Basic Skills Education Program used by the Army since 1977. Recruits who exceed the accession body fat composition standard by greater than 2 percent but no more than 6 percent attend the fitness track. Individuals in both tracks will remain in  the  course  for  a  maximum  of  ninety  days,  with  opportunities every three weeks to leave for basic training if they then have met or exceeded the Army's accession standards. Trainees in the fitness track who do not meet the body composition standard of 2 percent or less after ninety days will be processed for separation. Trainees in the academic track who do not meet the test score standard of 31 or higher will be evaluated using the whole-person concept and may be retained and sent to basic training. The service will review the pilot program's results in early FY 2023 to determine if the course should become permanent.

Prospective soldiers take notes during a class at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, where the Future Soldier Preparatory Course pilot program began in August 2022.



The reasons for the Army's ongoing recruiting crisis are various and complex. The 2020 Qualified Military Available Study , released in FY 2022, reported 77 percent of citizens 17 to 24 years of age were ineligible for military service without a waiver because of obesity, drug use, physical and mental health problems, misconduct, or insufficient aptitude-an increase of 6 percent from previous years.

The  Army  found  it  increasingly  difficult  to  reach  its  target demographic.  Instead  of  watching  television  or  listening  to  the radio, most young people use streaming services with ads created by algorithms  based  on  their  internet  search  histories,  so  many  never see  Army  recruiting  advertisements  that  appear  in  conventional media  outlets.  The  same  is  true  for  advertising  on  social  media platforms. Moreover, the military relied on Facebook and Instagram, but many young people prefer TikTok, which has been banned from government-issued mobile phones for security concerns because the app originated in China.

The COVID-19 pandemic hindered recruitment. The winter wave of the Omicron variant limited face-to-face recruiting. The military's

COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  also  contributed  to  fewer  applicants. According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention, 36 percent of people 18 to 24 years old were not fully vaccinated and thus were ineligible to enlist. Education suffered because of lockdowns and  virtual  schooling.  At  the  end  of  FY  2022,  the  Army  reported that overall Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores had  declined  by  13  percent.  Before  the  pandemic,  the  Army  had disqualified 30 to 40 percent of potential recruits because of obesity, low test scores, or drug use, but it now turned away up to 70 percent.

Military  Health  System  Genesis,  a  new  DoD  electronic  health record  and  patient  portal,  which  centralized  all  military  health records,  caused  unanticipated  complications  for  recruitment.  One intended  benefit  of  the  new  portal  was  a  reduction  of  the  time  it took for new recruits to pass physical and medical checks at military entrance processing stations. In practice, however, the Genesis system prolonged the process by weeks or months. Additionally, increased transparency within the system made it more likely that aspects of a  patient's  medical  history  would  come  to  light  and  disqualify  the recruit. A shortage of physician assistants and doctors for processing medical waiver requests added to delays. Recruits and their parents often became frustrated with the extra tests, and some gave up. The Army ordered reserve medical personnel to active duty to help work through the waiver backlog.

Other  factors  also  affected  recruiting.  By  FY  2022,  the  job market mostly had recovered from the unemployment triggered by the  COVID-19 pandemic. Military  pay  lagged  behind  civilian  pay as inflation rose. The number of young people with a propensity to serve dropped to 9 percent in FY 2022, the lowest rate in fifteen years. Survey respondents cited fear of injury or death or of developing posttraumatic  stress  disorder  or  other  psychological  problems  as  their primary reasons for disinterest in military service.

The Army had mixed results with retention. As in recent years, retention remained high for the RA, which exceeded its goal of 55,934 soldiers by 2,370. The reserve components both missed their retention goals. The ARNG fell 3,437 soldiers short of its retention goal of 35,345, and the USAR fell 2,987 soldiers short of its retention goal of 13,500.

Racial  and  ethnic  demographics  across  the  enlisted  ranks  were similar to previous fiscal years ( Table 12 ).

In the RA, 29 percent of junior enlisted personnel and 71 percent of NCOs were married. Thirty-one percent of junior enlisted soldiers and  73  percent  of  NCOs  had  children.  In  the  ARNG,  14  percent of  junior  enlisted  soldiers  and  54  percent  of  NCOs were married. Fourteen  percent  of  junior  enlisted  and  52  percent  of  NCOs  had children.  In  the  USAR,  22  percent  of  junior  enlisted  personnel and 59 percent of NCOs were married. Eighteen percent of junior enlisted USAR soldiers had children, as did 52 percent of NCOs.

In  FY  2022,  efforts  to  improve  talent  management  expanded to  include  senior  NCOs.  After  a  successful  pilot  program  during the  previous  fiscal  year,  the  Sergeant  Major  Assessment  Program conducted  its  first  full  iteration  with  334  participants.  The  pilot run of the First Sergeant Talent Alignment Assessment continued with two iterations-one at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and another at Schofield Barracks, Hawai'i. This pilot program for first sergeants will continue into the next fiscal year.

U.S. Army Human Resources Command enhanced the Enlisted Manning Cycle/Assignment Satisfaction Key-Enlisted Module during the fiscal year. It created a pilot two-way market for master sergeants in certain career management fields, similar to the Army Interactive Module Version 2 for officers. The command introduced assignment  preferencing  for  master  sergeants  who  attend  the

Sergeants Major Academy but will not be utilized as sergeants major after  graduation.  Finally,  Human  Resources  Command  continued working  on  a  new  additional  skill  indicator  and  professional development proficiency code for NCOs in infantry, field artillery, and armor career management fields who have finished a careerdevelopment assignment.

In January 2022, the Army expanded the policy of permitting temporary promotion for nonresident students who were unable to complete professional military education required for promotion to include all ranks between sergeant and master sergeant. Many NCOs had  been  passed  over  for  promotion  because  they  had  not  been able  to  schedule  required  professional  military  education  courses. Temporarily promoted NCOs had a year to complete the necessary courses or they would revert to their previous rank. Soldiers who reverted to their previous rank did not have to repay the extra pay or allowances they had received during their temporary promotion.

## Civilian Personnel

On 30 September 2022, the Army had 236,590 appropriated fund civilian employees and 23,008 nonappropriated fund employees, a decline of nearly 33,000 appropriated fund employees from the start of the fiscal year. Most of the decline resulted from the reassignment of medical  personnel  from  MEDCOM  to  the  Defense  Health Agency (DHA) in waves in September 2021 and in July, August, and September 2022. A final wave will take place in October 2022. The number  of  nonappropriated  fund  employees  remained  essentially unchanged ( Table 13 ).

During FY 2021, minorities accounted for 34 percent of the civilian workforce, veterans 50 percent, women 35 percent, and disabled people 13 percent. The proportion of women was 3.4 percent lower than the previous fiscal year because MEDCOM lost 22,409 female employees to DHA. The other diversity categories in the Army remained relatively constant. Army civilian employees tend to be older, and the majority of the workforce is concentrated in the 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 age ranges, which collectively make up 51 percent of civilian employees.

Time-to-hire remained a significant issue for HQDA. The Office of Personnel Management benchmark for all civilian hiring is eighty days. During the fiscal year, the Army's time-to-hire for all positions fluctuated from a high of one hundred days to a low of eighty-one days. The average for FY 2022 was ninety days, a four-day increase from FY 2021 and a total increase of seven days since FY 2020, despite an increased use of direct hire authorities.

The  Army  took  important  strides  to  be  more  competitive  for civilian  talent  during  the  fiscal  year.  In  October  2021,  the  Army Civilian Career Management  Activity  reached full operational capability. The new agency consolidated thirty-two career programs for civilian employees into eleven career fields. This approach offered civilian employees more flexibility to take their skills from one position to another and enabled the Army to take a less siloed approach in recruiting new talent. The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, updated the Army Pathway Programs for FY 2022 to FY 2024 and secured  funding  to  expand  outreach  and  innovative  recruitment efforts for Army civilians. Additionally, the office established policy and guidance on the use of the USA Hire standard assessment and made the first comprehensive civilian employment reference guide to help veterans and spouses understand the federal hiring process.

During FY 2022, the Army Civilian Human Resources Agency took  the  lead  on  several  initiatives.  The  DoD  transitioned  human

resources  services  for  the  military  medical  treatment  facilities  of the DHA to the Civilian Human Resources Agency, which had been assigned  as  its  sole  human  resources  service  provider.  The  agency created three new human resources centers for all cyber positions, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Army Forces Command. It also supported the transition of civilian human resources support to U.S. Cyber Command from the Air Force to the Army, which will be completed in FY 2024. The agency processed 10,951 retirements in FY 2022, 11.6 percent more than in FY 2021.

In August 2022, the Cyber Excepted Service Proponency Office in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civilian Personnel) began the transition to the new Cyber Excepted Service personnel  system.  Based  on  authorities  granted  by  Congress  in FY 2016, the Army will recruit new civilian employees and voluntarily convert current civilian employees from the competitive service to the excepted service. Upon full conversion by the end of FY 2023, the Cyber Excepted Service workforce is projected to have around 7,000 positions.

## COVID-19 Vaccine

On 24 August 2021, the DoD directed members of the active armed forces to become vaccinated against COVID-19. On 30 November 2021,  DoD  also  required  members  of  the  reserve  components  to become  vaccinated  against  COVID-19.  By  the  end  of  FY  2022, 97 percent of the RA was vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine. By the end of FY 2022, 767 RA soldiers had requested a permanent medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination; the Army approved 27 of these requests. Of the 4,664 RA soldiers who requested a permanent religious  exemption,  44  received  approval.  There  were  2,454  RA soldiers  with  approved  temporary  exemptions.  The  RA  separated from the service 1,722 soldiers who had refused to be vaccinated and were ineligible for temporary exemption.

Beginning  on  1  July  2022,  as  directed  by  the  secretary  of defense,  members  of  the  reserve  components  who  refused  to comply  with  the  lawful  order  for  a  COVID-19  vaccination,  and

who  did  not  have  an  approved  or  pending  exemption  request, could not participate in federally funded training and would not receive pay or retirement credit. By the end of FY 2022, 90 percent of the ARNG was completely vaccinated. Of the 64 ARNG soldiers who requested a permanent medical exemption from vaccination, 10 received approval. Of the 1,822 ARNG soldiers who requested a  permanent religious  exemption,  1  received  approval.  There  were 6,877  ARNG  soldiers  with  approved  temporary  exemptions,  and 8,826 refused to be vaccinated. By the end of FY 2022, 91 percent of the USAR was completely vaccinated. Of the 332 USAR soldiers who requested  a  permanent  medical  exemption  from  vaccination, 10 received approval. Of the 2,052 USAR soldiers who requested a permanent  religious  exemption,  1  received  approval.  There  were 3,456  USAR  soldiers  with  approved  temporary  exemptions,  and 4,818 refused to be vaccinated. By the end of FY 2022, no reserve component soldiers had been separated from the service for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination.

In November 2021, the governor of Oklahoma requested that the DoD exempt his state's National Guard from the requirement that all reserve component members be vaccinated against COVID-19. The governor argued that this requirement should only apply to guard personnel on Title 10 federal active duty. Shortly after this request, Oklahoma's adjutant general declared that the state would not require its guard members to be vaccinated. The secretary of defense denied the governor's request on the grounds that the National Guard, even when in state status, must still meet federal mission requirements, including medical requirements such as vaccinations. The state of Oklahoma then filed a federal lawsuit seeking to end the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for its National Guard. Later in FY 2022, the governors of Texas and Alaska sued the DoD for the same reason.

## People First

The secretary of the Army established the Fort Hood Independent Review  Committee  at  the  end  of  FY  2020  after  the  murder  of

Spc. Vanessa Guillén at Fort Hood. In early FY 2021, the committee released a report that found the implementation of Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) initiatives at Fort Hood had been ineffective and that officials there had failed to identify or address serious crime issues both on and off post. The secretary  of  the  Army  established  the  People  First  Task  Force  in December 2020 to analyze the committee's recommendations and develop a plan based on the recommendations.

In May 2022, Fort Hood opened a People First Center, the first of its kind in the Army. The center places experts in family advocacy, sexual harassment and assault prevention, equal opportunity, resiliency, substance  abuse,  suicide,  and  spiritual readiness  in one  location  on  post.  These  experts  focus  on  preventing  harmful behaviors before they happen.

During  FY  2022,  the  People  First  Task  Force  implemented reforms to the SHARP program as part of an ongoing overhaul of how the Army responds to sexual harassment and sexual assault. In November 2021, the DoD instructed the Army to align its SHARP program  with  DoD's  updated  policies.  The  Army  removed  sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates from unit command reporting structures and placed them under a lead sexual assault response coordinator at each installation, who in turn advised the installation commander. Additionally, HQDA created a policy and oversight branch in the SHARP Program Office to standardize sexual assault review boards and SHARP position descriptions. The SHARP Program Office  also  started  work  on  a  sexual  harassment  tracking tool and an installation dashboard to better track incidents and alert soldiers about sexual violence on post.

In April 2022, the People First Task Force began a one-year trial of the SHARP Fusion Directorate to test initiatives at Aberdeen Proving Ground; Fort Riley; Schofield Barracks; Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort  Irwin,  California;  and  Fort  Sill,  Oklahoma.  Each  installation's SHARP Fusion Directorate became responsible for coordinating all the elements of victim response-sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates, medical care providers, law enforcement investigators, and criminal prosecutors-to make it easier for victims

to obtain the help that they need. The installation's lead sexual assault response coordinator became the head of the directorate. In July 2022, the USAR established a virtual SHARP Fusion Directorate for the 99th Readiness Division to test the program for the reserve components.

In July 2022, in an attempt to increase reporting, Army Directive 2022-10 gave commanders the discretion to deem misconduct minor if committed by a victim at the time of a sexual assault. Victims often had not reported sexual assault because of the possibility that they also might face disciplinary actions for their own conduct, such as the underage consumption of alcohol. In September 2022, Army Directive 2022-13  implemented  reforms  regarding  sexual  harassment  and sexual  assault  investigations,  administrative  and  criminal  processes for alleged offenders, and protective requirements for alleged victims. It  also  requires  commanders  to  initiate  involuntary  administrative separation  proceedings  for  all  soldiers  against  whom  there  is  a

substantiated complaint of sexual harassment, unless the soldier has been otherwise punitively discharged or dismissed from the Army as part of a court-martial sentence. Involuntary separation proceedings are initiated after the soldier's appellate rights have been exhausted as they relate to an administrative investigation substantiating a sexual harassment complaint.

In FY 2022, 1,225 victims made a restricted report of sexual assault. Of these, 1,195 victims were RA, activated USAR, ARNG in Title 10 status,  or  cadets.  Eighteen  victims  not  in  the  Army  made  reports involving a soldier. For twelve cases, the relevant information was not available. There were 2,679 unrestricted reports of sexual assault. Of these,  2,077  reports  were  from  the  RA,  activated  USAR,  ARNG  in Title 10 status, and cadets; 426 people not in the Army made reports involving a soldier; and for 176 cases the relevant information was not available. In the ARNG, 201 victims made a restricted report of sexual assault, and 362 made an unrestricted report while in Title 32 status.

In  April  2022,  Army  Directive  2022-06  enacted  changes  to parental, pregnancy, and postpartum policies in the Army. A mother and  her  spouse  now  receive  convalescent  leave  after  the  loss  of  a pregnancy.  Soldiers  do  not  need  preapproved  leave  to  terminate  a pregnancy, and they qualify for convalescent leave after an abortion. New mothers  have  a  year  to  return  to  body  fat  standards.  Several changes  pertain to professional military education: postpartum soldiers are able to defer professional military education for up to a year; education facilities provide lactation accommodations; schools accommodate absences better during a pregnancy; pregnancy does not  automatically  disqualify  a  soldier  from  graduating;  and  both parents are able to defer operational training for a year so at least one can remain home with the child.

The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, created a standing panel of Army spouses who respond to short surveys, which can be analyzed quickly, to help HQDA make decisions that affect spouses. In  May  2022,  approximately  32,000  randomly  selected  spouses received  postcard  invitations  with  a  QR  code  to  join  'Today's Army Spouse Panel' and complete the intake survey. The invitations produced a response rate of 18.3 percent.

After the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling in June 2022, some states outlawed abortion, and others enacted restrictions on the procedure. In response to concerns from some soldiers about being  assigned  to  installations  in  these  states,  General  James  C. McConville, the chief of staff of the Army, stated in September 2022 that the service would not change its compassionate reassignment policy to allow soldiers to transfer from or refuse assignment to an installation in one of these states.

In March 2022, after a two-year pilot program, the Army made permanent the People First Task Force's cohesion assessment team program. As opposed to a compliance-based inspection or a staff assistance visit, the team observes units and provides commanders with an assessment and advice about how to improve unit climate. During the fiscal year, teams visited Fort Hood; Schofield Barracks; and Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)'s Equity and Inclusion Agency continued 'Your Voice'  listening  sessions,  hearing  from  more  than  2,990  soldiers and  civilians  through  fifty-nine  sessions  across  eight  installations during  FY  2022.  The  agency  headed  the  effort  to  reestablish  the Army  Diversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion  Council  and  organized  its first session.

The  secretary  of  the  Army  chartered  the  Quality  of  Life  Task Force in March 2020. The task force, led by HQDA 's deputy chief of staff, G-9, developed a campaign plan, nested within the Army People  Strategy , for  a  comprehensive  approach  to  strengthening quality-of-life  programs  across  the  Army.  The  plan  consists  of  6 lines  of  effort,  31  objectives,  and  222  tasks.  The  six  lines  of  effort are housing, healthcare, childcare, spouse employment, permanent change of station moves, and bolstering facilities and programs at remote installations with critical quality-of-life needs. By the end of FY 2022, the task force had completed 10 out of 31 quality-of-life campaign plan objectives and 134 out of 222 tasks.

Alaska became a focus for Army quality-of-life initiatives during FY 2022 because soldiers in this state showed a higher propensity for  suicide.  In  May  2022,  the  service  and  DHA  started  hiring

more civilian  behavior  health  providers,  and  the  Army  mobilized USAR  behavioral  health  professionals  and  chaplains  trained  in pastoral-care  counseling  for  active  duty  service  in  Alaska.  The DoD  Office  of  Military  Community  and  Family  Policy  provided additional military and family life counselors for units in the state. Soldiers  in  Alaska  now  receive  Remote  and  Austere  Conditions Assignment  Incentive  Pay, and  the service began  a program preparing newly assigned soldiers and their families for winter in the state.

In FY 2022, the Army required senior commanders to deliver in-person suicide prevention guidance to subordinate commanders, down to the platoon level, and the Center for Army Lessons Learned published the Senior Commander's Guide to Suicide Prevention and the Brigade and Battalion Commander's Guide to Suicide Prevention . During the fiscal year, 150 members of the RA, 75 members of the ARNG, and 45 members of the USAR died by suicide. Compared to FY 2021, this was a decrease of 26 in the RA and 44 in the ARNG, and an increase of 4 in the USAR.

The Exceptional Family Member Program allows soldiers and their spouses to manage the care of a family member with special needs.  In  August  2022,  the  Army  transitioned  the  program  to  a new online tool  available  via  a  website  or  a  phone  app,  replacing various manual processes. The new system streamlines enrollment, provides transparency, and synchronizes assignment coordination. The  initial  platform  offered  basic  enrollment  and  family  member travel screenings, but confusing verbiage, incorrect processes, and  redundant  steps  led  to  significant  delays  to  enrollments  and overseas screening. By the end of FY 2022, 148 enrollments had been completed, and 2,224 were pending. The new tool could not provide family  member  travel  screenings,  nor  could  it  fulfill  command sponsorship  requests  for  family  members  living  apart  from  their soldiers. Consequently, many family members had to process their travel screening requests through the legacy web-based system. The new tool also could not process travel concerns or disenrollments. By the end of FY 2022, 128 family member travel screenings had been completed in the new system, and 1,376 were pending.

## Special Topics

The  Integrated  Personnel  and  Pay  System-Army  is  a  web-based human resource platform that supports total force visibility, talent management,  and  auditability.  The  Army  opted  to  release  the Integrated  Personnel  and  Pay  System-Army  in  yearly  iterations instead  of  all  at  once.  Release  2  went  online  with  the  ARNG  in FY 2022. Release 3, which will provide human resources and pay capability  to  all  three  components,  was  scheduled  for  fielding  in December 2021. In October 2021, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, delayed Release 3 until September 2022 because it failed a  key  test.  In  August  2022,  the  G-1  again  delayed  Release  3,  this time indefinitely, because of a disappointing stress test and critical soldier feedback. Nevertheless, the G-1 and the U.S. Army Financial Management Command decided that pay for all active duty soldiers would shift to a semimonthly schedule in preparation for Release 4 at the start of FY 2023.

The Army made progress in making fully functional an online platform for administering soldiers' educational benefits. In March 2021,  Army  IgnitED  replaced  the  tuition  assistance  portal  GoArmyED, but the service shut it down almost at once because lost data severely impaired its operation. The Army then transferred responsibility for tuition assistance from Human Resources Command to the Army Combined Arms Center. In July 2021, Army IgnitED relaunched with partial functionality. In September 2022, Army IgnitED reached 95 percent functionality, but the platform will not be fully operational until  September 2023. More than 110,000 soldiers routinely used educational benefits. Many soldiers had to pay out of pocket to take courses, and many educational institutions did not receive payment. Army University reimbursed all soldiers by the end of FY 2022 and will pay all educational institutions by the first quarter of FY 2023.

In  October  2021,  the  G-1's  Uniform  Policy  Office  excused female soldiers from wearing dress uniforms for up to a year after giving birth. In April 2022, the office introduced the nameplate for the Army Green Service Uniform. Dark brown with taupe lettering, a matte finish, and beveled edges, the new nameplate permits the

use of accent marks and hyphens, which can assist other soldiers in properly pronouncing the wearer's name.

On 29 April 2022, the Army bestowed a posthumous honorary promotion to brigadier general upon Charles Young, its first Black colonel,  in  a  ceremony  at  West  Point.  Born  to  enslaved  parents in  1864,  Young  became,  in  1889,  the  third  African  American  to graduate from West Point. He led a cavalry troop in the Philippine Insurrection,  became the first  Black  superintendent  of  a  national park  (the  Army  supervised  national  parks  at  that  time),  was  a military  attaché  to  Liberia,  and  commanded  a  cavalry  squadron

during the Mexican  Expedition campaign. After the United States entered World War I, Young should have been promoted to brigadier general, as were his White peers, as part of the service's massive expansion for the war. Instead, the secretary of war acceded to  racist  fears  of  a  Black  officer  commanding  White  officers  and used Young's existing kidney ailment to declare him unfit for active service,  forcing  Young  to  retire  on  medical  grounds.  The  Army recalled  Young  to  active  duty  after  the  war  for  service  in  Liberia as a military attaché. He died in 1922 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

## Medal of Honor

During  the  fiscal  year,  President  Joseph  R.  Biden  Jr.  awarded seven soldiers the Medal of Honor in two ceremonies at the White House. On 16 December 2021, Sfc. Alwyn C. Cashe (posthumous), Sfc. Christopher A. Celiz (posthumous) and M. Sgt. Earl D. Plumlee received  the  award  for  their  actions  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  On 5 July 2022, S. Sgt. Edward N. Kaneshiro (posthumous), Maj. John J.  Duffy,  Spc.  5th  Class  Dwight  W .  Birdwell,  and  Spc.  5th  Class Dennis M. Fujii received the award for their actions in Vietnam.

President Biden presents the Medal of Honor to Katherine Celiz ( left ), the widow of Sfc. Christopher A. Celiz, and their daughter Shannon at the White House on 16 December 2021.



On 17 October 2005, Sergeant Cashe, commander of a Bradley fighting vehicle in Company  A,  1st  Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment,  was  on  a  night  patrol  near  Samarra' ,  Iraq.  His  vehicle struck an improvised explosive device and burst into flames. Cashe, drenched in fuel, passed through the fire to rescue the driver. Then, while under attack from the enemy, he opened a hatch to help four soldiers escape and reentered the burning vehicle to save two others. Cashe died on 8 November from severe burns that covered most of his body.

On  12  July  2018,  Sergeant  Celiz,  1st  Battalion,  75th  Ranger Regiment, participated in an operation to clear enemy forces from an area in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. After his unit came under attack, Celiz risked exposure to return fire, which enabled the force to regain the initiative, maneuver to a secure location, and begin to treat a critically wounded Afghan soldier. He then directed the evacuation of the wounded by helicopter, placing himself between the enemy and the helicopter to ensure it could take off. Badly wounded but understanding the peril to the aircraft if its crew attempted to load him aboard, Celiz signaled to the pilot to leave without him. He died later that day.

On 28 August 2013, Sergeant Plumlee, Company C, 4th Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group, was stationed at a forward operating base in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. The enemy blew a breach in the base's perimeter fortifications and began an attack. Plumlee and five others responded in two vehicles. When the enemy engaged them, Plumlee exited his vehicle and, with complete disregard for his safety, advanced toward the enemy, engaging multiple insurgents with his pistol. Plumlee killed two of the enemy with a grenade and a third by detonating a suicide vest with a well-aimed shot. He then continued to  move  forward,  rallying  a  small  group  of  American  and  Polish soldiers, to fight off more suicide bombers. Plumlee then rescued a wounded American soldier and finished clearing the area.

On  1  December  1966,  the  platoon  of  Sergeant  Kaneshiro, an  infantry  squad  leader  in  Troop  C,  1st  Squadron,  9th  Cavalry Regiment, entered the village of Phu Huu 2, Republic of Vietnam, where the enemy ambushed two squads at the center of the village. Kaneshiro deployed his squad to cover and then crawled forward to attack the enemy force alone. He destroyed three groups of enemies, one with rifle fire and two with grenades, which allowed the platoon

to extricate itself from the ambush. Kaneshiro was killed in action on 6 March 1967.

Major Duffy, 5th Special Forces Group, was the senior adviser to the 11th Airborne Battalion, 2d Brigade, Airborne Division (Army of the Republic of Vietnam), which was defending Fire Support Base Charlie in Kon Tum Province. Despite the earlier destruction of the battalion command post, the death of the battalion commander,

and  his  own  wounds,  Duffy  refused  medical  evacuation.  On 14  April  1972,  the  enemy  surrounded  the  base.  As  he  called  in airstrikes,  Duffy  was  wounded  again.  When  the  enemy  began  its assault, he remained exposed to direct return fire. The next day, he led the battalion's survivors to an evacuation area that he marked for helicopters and secured by directing gunship attacks on the enemy. Only after ensuring that all the survivors had been loaded did Duffy board a helicopter.

On 31 January 1968, Specialist Birdwell, of Troop C, 3d Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, and his unit defended the Tan Son Nhut Air Base  near  Saigon.  After  his  tank's  commander  was  incapacitated, Birdwell, under heavy small-arms fire, moved the man to safety and took  command  of  the  vehicle.  From  the  exposed  position  of  the tank commander's hatch, he engaged the enemy with machine-gun fire.  After  expending the tank's ammunition, Birdwell dismounted and obtained two machine guns and ammunition, which he and a comrade used until enemy fire destroyed his weapon and wounded him.  Birdwell  refused  to  be  evacuated  and  led  a  small  group  of defenders until reinforcements arrived. He then helped evacuate the wounded until he was ordered to seek attention for his wounds.

President Biden presents the Medal of Honor to former Sp5c. Dennis M. Fujii at the White House on 5 July 2022.



Specialist Fujii was the crew chief on a helicopter of the 237th Medical Detachment, 61st Medical Battalion, 67th Medical Group. On  18  February  1971,  the  enemy  shot  down  his  helicopter  as  it attempted to evacuate wounded South Vietnamese soldiers from a base in Laos. A second helicopter landed, and the rest of his crew boarded, but Fujii directed the helicopter to depart when the intensity of  enemy  fire  threatened  to  destroy  it.  During  the  next  two  days, a wounded Fujii treated Vietnamese soldiers and directed gunship attacks in defense of the base, repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire. On 20 February, a helicopter retrieved him, but after being hit, it  crashed  at  another  South  Vietnamese  base  in  Laos,  where  Fujii remained until another helicopter evacuated him to South Vietnam.

## Force Development, Training, and Operational Forces

Force  development  is  the  process  of  determining  Army  doctrine, leader  development,  training,  organization,  soldier  development, and materiel requirements and translating them into programs and structures within allocated resources to accomplish Army missions and functions. It supports Army Campaign Plan objectives through the  preparation  of  doctrine,  modernization  of  equipment,  and training programs.

During  FY  2022,  the  service  worked  on  updating  the  ' Army Vision' published in October 2018 as it continued its most significant transformation in forty years. The service will publish the update, ' Army  2030, '  in  October  2022.  The  Army  also  began  designing concepts and modernization priorities for the force of 2040.

## Readiness

In  May  2020,  the  secretary  of  the  Army  approved  ReARMM,  a flexible, predictable force generation process that creates a regionally and  functionally  aligned  Army.  It  provides  greater  certainty  for training, reserve components, logistical requirements, and personnel managers. A key component of ReARMM is predictable windows for units to field the capabilities necessary to build a multidomaincapable  Army,  while  at  the  same  time  continuing  to  provide  a predictable supply of ready units to the joint force. In October 2021, ReARMM achieved initial operating capability and is expected to reach full operating capability in FY 2024's first quarter.

The  readiness  of  the  Army's  fifty-eight  brigade  combat  teams (BCTs) increased during FY 2022. In May 2021, eighteen of thirtyone RA BCTs were at their highest levels of readiness; none of the twenty-seven ARNG BCTs were. By July 2022, the number of BCTs reported at the highest levels of readiness stood at twenty-five-all

in the RA. Nineteen brigades participated in combat training center rotations: seven BCTs at the National Training Center, seven BCTs and  two  security  force  assistance  brigades  at  the  Joint  Readiness Training Center, and three BCTs at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center. Additionally, elements of the 1st Special Forces Command, the  75th  Ranger  Regiment,  and  the  160th  Aviation  Regiment (Special Operations) conducted a training center rotation. Two of the rotations were for ARNG BCTs which had received the resources necessary  to  achieve  company-level  proficiency.  The  remaining twenty-five BCTs in the ARNG are set to attain platoon-minus-level proficiency and will need additional training before deploying.

## Doctrine and Future Force

The Army intended to publish a revision of its capstone operations doctrine,  Field  Manual  (FM)  3-0, Operations ,  in  June  2022.  The service decided, however, to delay publication of the manual until October 2022 so as to incorporate lessons from the war in Ukraine. The  revision,  the  product  of  nearly  five  years  of  development, will  emphasize  multidomain  operations  as  the  Army  focuses  on preparations for large-scale combat against peer adversaries. It will supersede the version of FM 3-0 published in October 2017 and is the first major evolution of Army operational doctrine since the 1986 AirLand Battle doctrine.

The Army continued to refine its mission command doctrine during  FY  2022.  In  2019,  HQDA  had  issued  Army  Doctrine Publication 6-0, Mission Command: Command and Control of Army Forces .  This publication restores the term command and control -the  exercise  of  authority  and  direction  by  a  properly  designated commander over assigned and attached forces-to the Army lexicon because of the ambiguity its elimination in 2012 had caused. In May 2022, the service published a new version of FM 6-0, Commander and  Staff  Organization , that  supersedes  the  2014  edition.  The new FM 6-0 echoes the reintroduction of command and control in  Army  Doctrine  Publication  6-0,  stating  that  commanders  at every echelon establish command and control systems through the

arrangement of people, processes, networks, and command posts. It  provides  the  tactics,  procedures,  organizations,  templates,  and examples associated with command and control systems.

A new publication, FM 5-0, Planning and Orders Production, published in May 2022, consolidates these two topics into a single document. It supersedes information on this subject found in the 2014 edition of FM 6-0 and incorporates doctrine on Army design methodology. FM 5-0 states that planning-the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and laying out effective ways of bringing that future about-is a key activity of the operations process. It acknowledges that good plans facilitate effective action despite unforeseen events and that Army operations demand  flexible  approaches  that  adapt  planning  methods  to each situation.

U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) Pamphlet 71-20-6, Army Futures Command Concept for Fires, 2028 , released in October 2021, describes Army fires in multidomain operations. It is a foundation for the development of new fires capabilities. The concept expands on doctrinal definitions of Army fires established in Army Doctrine Publication 3-19, Fires , published in July 2019, and supersedes the Training  and  Doctrine  Command  Pamphlet  525-3-4, The  U.S. Army Functional Concept for Fires, 2020-2040 , published in January 2017.

The  Army  launched  efforts  to  modernize  its  health  system during FY 2022. AFC Pamphlet 71-20-12, Army Futures Command Concept for Medical , 2028 , published in March 2022, describes how the system, as part of globally integrated health services, will change to support multidomain operations within the 2028 timeframe. In May 2022, AFC published Army Medical Modernization Strategy , which  articulates how  the  system  will transform  to support multidomain operations with redesigned medical doctrine, capabilities, and formations by 2035 ( Figure 1 ).

In October 2021, the publication Army  Unified Network Plan described  how  the  service  will  modernize  its  networks  and information  technology  systems  by  2028  to  support  multidomain operations.  The  plan  has  five  lines  of  effort:  (1)  establish  the

Unified  Network  to  enable  multidomain  operations,  (2)  posture the Army for multidomain operations, (3) provide network security and  survivability  to  enable  commanders'  freedom  of  action,  (4) reform processes and policies to improve network performance and affordability, and (5) sustain enterprise and tactical networks.

In  February  2022,  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the Army (Installations, Energy, and Environment) published the Army Climate Strategy .  It  acknowledges that climate change will affect the Army at all levels-from how and where units operate and train, to how the service equips and sustains soldiers to fight in multidomain

operations. The strategy sets out three lines of effort: (1) improve the resilience  and  sustainability  of  Army  installations,  (2)  increase  the capability and resilience of operational forces by leveraging acquisition and logistics programs to reduce sustainment demands, and (3) train Army  forces  to  operate  in  a  climate-altered  world.  The  strategy's objective is a land force able to operate in all domains with effective mitigation measures against the effects of climate change. It establishes goals of achieving a 50 percent reduction in Army net greenhouse gas pollution by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, attaining net-zero Army greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and proactively considering the security implications of climate change. In October 2022, the Army will publish the implementation plan for the Army Climate Strategy .

Futures  Command  launched  Project  Convergence  in  2020  as the process by which the Army rapidly and continuously integrates or  'converges'  effects  across  all  domains-air,  land,  sea,  space,  and cyberspace. During FY 2022, the command ran the project's second iteration from October to November 2021 and prepared for the third, which will run from September to November 2022. The U.S. Army Joint Modernization Command, headquartered at Fort Bliss, was the lead for Project Convergence in 2021 and 2022. The 2021 iteration expanded  beyond  tactical  Army-specific  efforts  to  hold  large-scale demonstrations and experiments involving the other services. Army units,  including  multidomain task force formations, participated in events  at  locations  such  as  Yuma  Proving  Ground,  Arizona;  White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; and Fort Bragg. The exercises tested more than one hundred new pieces of communications equipment and  provided  insights  into  network  resilience  and  the  difficulty  of integrating and understanding the volume of data that comes through the network.

Project Convergence 2022 includes scenarios shaped around the Indo-Pacific  and  European  theaters,  concepts  for  future  large-scale combat, long-range fires,  and  how  to  defeat  anti-access/area  denial systems. Navy, Air Force, Marine, and Space Force elements, along with participants from the United Kingdom and Australia, will join Army units in these exercises, testing more than 300 new pieces of technology at several locations.

## Force Structure

The mix of BCTs in the RA was eleven armored, thirteen infantry, and seven Stryker.  The  ARNG had five armored, twenty infantry, and two Stryker BCTs.

The Army continued to increase its capabilities at echelons above brigade to prepare for large-scale combat. The Army's Multi-Domain Transformation strategy, published in March 2021, identified multidomain-capable  theater  armies,  corps,  and  divisions  as  key to  command and control during future conflicts. In August 2021, the Army specified the years 2028-2030 as the 'waypoint' for the initial implementation of major force structure changes. Army leaders updated this objective in January 2022, making 2030 the target date for implementing most of the service's planned force structure changes, especially  the  provision  of  additional  personnel,  equipment,  and organizations to theater army, corps, and division headquarters, along with redesigning the organization of divisions.

In October 2020, the Army reactivated the V Corps headquarters at Fort Knox, Kentucky, as part of its effort to prepare for large-scale combat. Approximately 200 of the unit's 635 soldiers began operating from a forward command post in Poland on a rotational basis in FY 2021 to control U.S., allied, and partner tactical formations operating in Europe. The Army declared the V Corps headquarters fully operationally  capable in November 2021, after it completed the W arfighter 22-1 exercise in October 2021 that tested the unit in simulated largescale combat operations in a multinational environment.

In the Pacific region, the I Corps headquarters began experimenting with new corps-level warfighting concepts and formations over a wide geographic  area  using  small,  dispersed,  and  interconnected  nodal command structures. In November 2021, the corps tested a new early entry command post concept built around Stryker vehicles, during a short-notice deployment from Joint Base Lewis-McChord to Guam. The corps conducted a similar exercise in February 2022. I Corps will demonstrate  these  new  capabilities  during  an  Army  W arfighter exercise oriented to the Indo-Pacific region in SeptemberOctober 2022.

During FY 2022, the Army continued work on new formations for divisions. A  new  heavy  division  formation,  the  penetration division,  announced  during  FY  2021,  will  specialize  in  breaching enemy defensive lines and will have more engineer, bridging, longrange artillery, and maneuver capabilities than the standard heavy division.  Early  in  FY  2022,  the  Army  designated  the  1st  Cavalry Division to test this concept in FY 2023. It will also test the concepts and structures  necessary  to  make  the  penetration  division,  rather than the BCT, the Army's unit of action. Additionally, the Army, in FY 2022, publicized tentative changes in the designs of heavy, light, airborne, and air assault divisions.

The Army began reorganizing its combat forces in Alaska during FY 2022 as part of its Arctic strategy and to improve the morale of soldiers stationed in Alaska. Since 1994, forces in Alaska had been organized under U.S. Army Alaska, located at Joint Base ElmendorfRichardson. This was a subordinate command of U.S. Army Pacific and the ground element of Alaskan Command, a joint subordinate unified command of U.S. Northern Command. U.S. Army Alaska had  two  subordinate  BCTs-a  Stryker  BCT,  the  1st  BCT,  25th Infantry  Division,  located  at  Fort  Wainwright,  and  an  airborne infantry BCT, the 4th BCT, 25th Infantry Division, located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. In June 2022, the Army placed units in Alaska under a provisional 11th Airborne Division headquarters. The official reactivation of Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 11th Airborne Division, is scheduled for October 2023.

At the same time, the service reflagged the BCTs in Alaska. The 1st BCT, 25th Infantry Division, became the 1st BCT, 11th Airborne Division. The 4th BCT, 25th Airborne Division, became the 2d BCT, 11th Airborne Division. Additionally, the 1st BCT began converting from a Stryker BCT to an infantry BCT with air assault capabilities. By the end of FY 2022, the unit had divested itself of all its Stryker vehicles. The 2d BCT will remain an airborne infantry BCT. Both brigades also will receive new equipment geared toward their arctic and high-altitude missions.

Efforts continued  during  FY  2022  to  reinvigorate  artillery capabilities. At the theater level, the service activated Headquarters,

3d Multi-Domain Task Force, at Schofield Barracks in September 2022. It joined two existing task forces located at Joint Base LewisMcChord  and  Wiesbaden,  Germany.  These  units  deliver  and coordinate long-range fires and attacks against enemy anti-access/ area denial capabilities and also serve as test beds for new equipment and  concepts.  The  Army  expects  to  field  five  multidomain  task forces; the remaining two will focus on the Arctic region and global operations, respectively. The 56th Artillery Command was activated at  Mainz-Kastel,  Germany,  in  October  2021  to  serve  as  the  fires command headquarters in Europe, filling a gap at the theater level for planning and coordinating long-range fires. Also in October 2021, the Army completed fielding ground-based equipment and launchers for its first hypersonic missile battery. The equipment included a battery operations center, four launchers, and specialized trucks and trailers. During FY 2023, the service expects to deliver operational hypersonic rounds,  making  the  battery  fully  operational  by  the  end  of  the fiscal year.

Several reorganizations affected military intelligence, cyber, signal, and  information  operations  formations.  In  October  2021,  the  1st Information Operations Command was reassigned from U.S. Army Intelligence  and  Security  Command  to  Army  Cyber  Command  as part  of  the  evolution  of  the  service's  operations  in  the  information dimension. That same month, the 60th Signal Battalion was activated at Fort Gordon, Georgia, to support offensive and defensive cyberspace operations,  and,  in  March  2022,  it  was  assigned  to  Army  Cyber Command's U.S. Army Cyber Protection Brigade, which will become operational  early  in  FY  2023.  This  move  broadens  the  battalion's strategic  responsiveness  and  furthers  the  merger  of  the  Signal  and Cyber  branches  into  a  more  cohesive  force.  In  November  2021, Intelligence  and  Security  Command stood up the U.S. Army Cyber Military  Intelligence  Group  to  blend  military  intelligence  activities with commercially  available data and  public information  while supporting Army Cyber Command, U.S. Cyber Command, and other combatant commands. During FY 2022, the Army's Cyber Warfare Support  Battalion  915,  assigned  to  the  780th  Military  Intelligence Brigade, continued to organize and validate its unique cyber-

electromagnetic formations that will support units at the corps level and below. The battalion, which will have twelve expeditionary cyber and electromagnetic activities teams by 2026, each aligned to specific geographic theaters, had formed three such teams by the end of FY 2022.

In December 2021, the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Command replaced the 902d Military Intelligence Group, 308th and 310th Military Intelligence Battalions, and the U.S. Army Operations Security Detachment, all of which were inactivated in February 2022. The new command, organized at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, and assigned to Intelligence and Security Command, will conduct worldwide counterintelligence activities.

In  October  2021,  the  59th  Engineer  Company,  a  mobility augmentation  company  at  Fort  Hood,  became  the  first  combat engineer  company-armored.  This  conversion  is  part  of  the  plan to standardize  engineer  companies  at  echelons  above  brigade and reduce the number of engineer company types created under modularity.  The  company  received  six  joint  assault  bridges  and nine  M2A3  Bradley  fighting  vehicles  to  replace  its  M60  armored vehicle launched bridges and M113 armored personnel carriers. Six additional engineer companies are scheduled to convert to the new structure by FY 2024.

The Army's satellite communications mission transferred to  the  Space  Force  in  August  2022  as  part  of  the  reorganization that  consolidated  all  military  satellite  communications  functions under  a  single  service.  Personnel  from  the  U.S.  Army  Space  and Missile  Defense  Command's  53d  Signal  Battalion  will  transfer  to the  Space  Force;  the  battalion's  inactivation  is  scheduled  for  April 2023.  Meanwhile,  the  1st  Space  Brigade  reorganized  during  FY 2022,  converting  its  RA  six-person  space  support  teams,  focused on providing expertise to a division or corps staff, into four-person space control planning teams. The new teams integrate space-control capabilities for Army, joint, and coalition forces. The change did not affect the brigade's ARNG and USAR space support teams.

The  Army,  in  FY  2022,  continued  the  modernization  of  its finance units. Before 2007, there had been more than a dozen finance

battalions  at  various  installations,  but  these  were  inactivated  after 2007 because of the requirements of counterinsurgency operations and replaced by financial management support units commanded by majors. In June 2022, the 106th Financial Management Support Unit  in  Germany  was  reorganized  and  redesignated  as  the  106th Finance  Battalion  in  the  16th  Sustainment  Brigade.  The  15th Financial Management Support Unit at Fort Hood was reorganized and redesignated on 16 August 2022 as the 15th Finance Battalion in the 1st Cavalry Division Sustainment Brigade. The new finance battalions, led by lieutenant colonels, are better suited to support large-scale combat operations.

## Training

The Army conducted twenty combat training center rotations during FY  2022  using  updated  scenarios  and  opposition  forces  for  largescale  combat  instead  of  counterinsurgency.  The  new  Joint  Pacific Multinational  Training  Center  conducted  two  rotations,  one  in Hawai'i and one in Alaska. The center now permits brigades located in these states to undergo a combat training center rotation without the  expense  of  traveling  to  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center  at Fort Polk, and it can integrate units from other armies in the Pacific area into this type of training.

In 2018, Training and Doctrine Command  removed  land navigation  by  map  and  compass  from  the  Basic  Leader  Course  to make more time for classroom instruction. Concern over threats to digital navigation systems led to a pilot program, begun in July 2022, to reintroduce land navigation to the Basic Leader Courses at Fort Drum, Fort Bliss, and Schofield Barracks. Reinstating land navigation as a requirement for graduation from the Basic Leader Course will emphasize the importance of this skill in combat operations.

In March 2022, the secretary of the Army approved the revised Army Combat Fitness Test. The revision incorporated gender- and age-specific scoring standards, replaced the leg tuck test with a plank exercise, and added a 2½-mile walk as an alternative aerobic event for soldiers with a medical profile. Soldiers in the RA and the Active

Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division participate in Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center Rotation 22-01 at Kahuku Training Area, Hawai'i, in October 2021.



Guard Reserve program took a diagnostic Army Combat Fitness Test in FY 2022. Those who passed the test can use that result for record any  time  after  1  October  2022.  Reserve  component  soldiers  have taken or will take a diagnostic Army Combat Fitness Test between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023 and will have the same option to use their  diagnostic  test  for  record  after  1  April  2023.  All  RA  and the Active Guard Reserve will take a record test before 1 April 2023, and reserve component soldiers will take one before 1 April 2024. Record  scores  will  be  used  for  RA  administrative  actions  starting on 1 October 2022 and in the reserve components beginning on 1 April 2023. Passing the test will be a requirement for attending all professional military education courses in all three components starting in FY 2023.

## Operational Forces

During  FY  2022,  Army  units  engaged  in  a  variety  of  missions with multiple foreign partners and deployed forces from all three

components to combatant commands. Soldiers also participated in disaster relief, border security, and the other missions.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Central

During  FY  2022,  the  Army  continued  to  have  a  prominent  role in  Iraq,  Syria,  and  Kuwait,  most  notably  in  the  fight  against  the remnants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as part of Combined Joint  Task  Force-Operation  Inherent  Resolve.  In  addition,  the Army deployed units for Operation Spartan Shield and over-thehorizon operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Sentinel.  Army  casualties  for  FY  2022  in  Operation  Inherent Resolve were one nonhostile death and five wounded in action.

On 9 December 2021, U.S. forces ended their combat mission in  Iraq  in  accordance  with  a  July  2021  agreement  between  the Iraqi and U.S. governments, leaving 2,500 American troops in the country to train and assist Iraqi forces. In Syria, some 900 American military  personnel,  stationed  there  to  prevent  a  resurgence  of  the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, came under occasional rocket attack and responded with helicopter and artillery strikes. During FY 2022, as  part  of  Operation  Inherent  Resolve,  the  Army  maintained a BCT  in  the  region  for  intelligence  support,  joint  fires,  aerial surveillance,  training,  and  base  security  missions.  In  May  2022,  the 1st BCT, 10th Mountain Division, relieved the 1st BCT, 4th Infantry Division.  The  1st  Battalion,  227th  Aviation  Regiment,  from  the  1st Cavalry  Division,  deployed  for  Operation  Inherent  Resolve  until June 2022.

The Army maintained a division headquarters, two combined arms battalions, field artillery assets, and an aviation brigade in Kuwait as part of Operation Spartan Shield. In March 2022, the headquarters of the 35th Infantry Division (Kansas ARNG) deployed, replacing the headquarters of the 29th Infantry Division (Virginia ARNG). The 1st Battalion, 183d Cavalry Regiment (Virginia ARNG), replaced the 1st Battalion, 194th Armored Regiment (Minnesota ARNG), in January 2022 as the Army's initial rotational combined arms battalion in Kuwait. In September 2022, the 2d Battalion, 116th Cavalry Regiment (Idaho

ARNG), assumed this mission. A second combined arms battalion, the 1st Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment (Florida ARNG), arrived in fall 2021. In July 2022, the 1st Battalion, 182d Infantry Regiment (Massachusetts  ARNG),  replaced  it.  The  headquarters  of  the  130th Field  Artillery  Brigade  (Kansas  ARNG)  remained  in  Kuwait  until September 2021, when the headquarters of the 142d Field Artillery Brigade (Arkansas ARNG) arrived. The 197th Field Artillery Brigade headquarters (New Hampshire ARNG) assumed this mission in May 2022.  The  Army  also  maintained  a  high-mobility  artillery  rocket system (HIMARS) battalion in the region. The 3d Battalion, 157th Field Artillery Regiment (Colorado ARNG), replaced the 1st Battalion, 181st Field Artillery Regiment (Tennessee ARNG), in February 2021. The 11th Combat Aviation Brigade (USAR) replaced the Combat Aviation Brigade, 40th Infantry Division (California ARNG), in January 2022. In September 2022, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 36th Infantry Division (Texas ARNG), arrived to assume this mission. In addition to these forces, logistics units and elements of the 3d Security Force Assistance Brigade rotated to and from the U.S. Central Command area.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army South

U.S. Army South is responsible for Army operations in Central and South  America  and  the  Caribbean.  During  FY  2022,  it  conducted regional  exercises,  staff  talks,  and  humanitarian  relief  operations. The  missions  of  Joint  Task  Force  Bravo,  stationed  at  Soto  Cano Air  Base,  Honduras,  and  its  primary  unit,  the  1st  Battalion,  228th Aviation Regiment, include helicopter support to counter organized crime,  medical  readiness  training,  and  disaster  relief  support.  The 525th Military Police Battalion continued to support Joint Task Force Guantanamo.

Elements  of  the  3d  BCT,  101st  Airborne  Division,  and  the  1st Battalion, 54th Security Force Assistance Regiment (Georgia ARNG), participated  in  Exercise  Southern  V anguard  22  along  with  units from  the  Brazilian  army.  ARNG  soldiers  from  Alabama,  Florida, Kentucky,  Louisiana,  and  Washington,  D.C.,  along  with  the  USAR's 348th  Field  Hospital  and  RA  special  forces,  deployed  for  the  U.S.

Southern  Command's  thirty-seventh  Tradewinds  exercise.  Army forces  also  participated  in  the  2022  iteration  of  the  U.S.  Southern Command's Panamax series of multinational exercises focused on the security of the Panama Canal.

Army-to-army  staff talks build partnerships and coordinate bilateral exercises. In April 2022, the Brazilian army hosted the thirtyfifth  cycle  of  the  Conference  of  American  Armies  with  participants from  twenty-four  countries  and  a  focus  on  armies  of  the  future. U.S.  Army  South  hosted  the  seventh  annual  Peru-U.S.  Army  Staff Talks at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, in May 2022. In September 2022, representatives from U.S. Army South traveled to Honduras to lead a Central American Working Group meeting that included armies from El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  and  Honduras.  The  participants  reviewed accomplishments from 2022, coordinated efforts scheduled for 2023, and discussed possible events for 2023 through 2027.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Pacific

During FY 2022, the Army identified five tasks in the Indo-Pacific region:  (1)  enable  joint  operations  by  establishing  and  protecting bases and staging areas, (2) support other American services with logistics  and  communications  capabilities,  (3)  conduct  command and control at the division level and above, (4) provide long-range fires capabilities, and (5) prepare for the mission of counterattack using maneuver forces. Units stationed in the Indo-Pacific region and  the  Republic  of  Korea,  along  with  additional  soldiers  from the continental United States, participated in numerous exercises during  FY  2022,  demonstrating  American  commitment  to  the region, bolstering relationships with regional partners, and testing future operating concepts and weapon systems.

The  USAR  9th  Mission  Support  Command's  Task  Force Oceania has soldiers from all three components with civil affairs and  culturally  relevant  skills  formed  in  two-person  teams,  each focused on a nation in the area. The task force's deployments in FY  2022  included  Palau,  Tonga,  and  Papua  New  Guinea.  The 5th  Security  Force  Assistance  Brigade,  stationed  at  Joint  Base

Lewis-McChord, saw increased demand throughout FY 2022 for partnerships  across  the  Pacific  and  northern  parts  of  Asia  and sent  advisers  to  fourteen  different  locations.  In  October  2021, the  U.S.  government  confirmed  media  stories  that  special  forces soldiers and marine raiders had been in Taiwan training with their counterparts for at least the past year.

U.S. Army  Pacific reorganized its Pacific Pathways and Defender-Pacific programs into a new effort called Operation Pathways. Pacific Pathways, launched in 2014, combined multiple preexisting  exercises  with  partner  nations  into  integrated  operations. Defender-Pacific envisioned division-sized deployments across the  region  in  2020  and  2021,  mirroring  the  Defender-Europe exercises, but the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the scale  of  Defender-Pacific  for  both  years.  The  new  Operation Pathways  creates  opportunities  to  train  joint  targeting  across all  domains,  tests  the  services'  future  operating  concepts,  and continues  building  relationships  with  regional  militaries.  U.S. Army Pacific hosted the Unified Pacific Wargame Series in Hawai'i in  May  2022,  which  provided  insight  into  the  contributions  a theater Army might make in the Indo-Pacific region and helped the service make resourcing decisions for the region.

The Army conducted several bilateral and multilateral training exercises  with  allies  and  partners.  In  October  2021,  350  soldiers from the Indian Army joined paratroopers from the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th BCT, in Alaska for the regular Yudh Abhyas exercise.  During  the  past  decade,  the  exercise  has  been conducted biannually at Joint Base Lewis-McChord using desert scenarios, but this year's training focused on mountainous, coldweather environments. In November 2021, U.S. Army Pacific and the  Malaysian  Armed  Forces  participated  in  the  seventh  annual Bersama  Warrior  bilateral  joint  staff  exercise.  Soldiers  from the  25th  Infantry  Division  trained  with  the  Royal  Thai  Army  at the eleventh annual Hanuman Guardian exercise that ran from February to March 2022 in Thailand. At the same time, elements of  a  Stryker  BCT  and  a  combat  aviation  brigade  participated  in the forty-first annual Cobra Gold exercises in Thailand. In June

2022, a Stryker BCT traveled to Singapore for the annual Tiger Balm exercise. The Army resumed several engagements in 2022 that had been on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the Khaan Quest exercise in Mongolia, which lasted for two weeks  in  June  2022.  RA  and  ARNG  soldiers  joined  participants from  fourteen  other  nations  to  train  alongside  the  Mongolian Armed Forces.

The Army demonstrated its ability to conduct indirect and air defense fires during various exercises. In March 2022, as part of Balikatan 22, a Navy hovercraft transported a Patriot air defense missile  battery  from  Okinawa  to  a  beach  in  the  Philippines.  In June  2022,  a  Patriot  unit  deployed  to  Palau  shot  down  a  drone target  during  the  V aliant  Shield  exercise.  In  August  2022,  the 17th Field Artillery Brigade deployed a HIMARS unit from Joint Base  Lewis-McChord  to  Indonesia  where  it  conducted  live-fire drills during the annual Super Garuda Shield exercise. During

the  annual  Orient  Shield  exercise  in  Japan,  soldiers  from  the 11th Airborne Division conducted live-fire training while the 1st Multi-Domain  Task  Force  and  the  17th  Field  Artillery  Brigade held  a  command  post  exercise  for  bilateral  targeting  and  crossdomain operations.

In  2004,  the  U.S.  and  South  Korean  governments  agreed  to move all American forces in South Korea to garrisons south of the Han River. The United States will relocate most of these forces to Camp Humphreys, about 40 miles south of Seoul on the west coast of the peninsula. On 10 December 2020, U.S. and South Korean officials agreed to transfer parts of U.S. Army Garrison YongsanCasey and a dozen other U.S. military sites  to  South  Korea.  On 2  December 2021, American and South Korean defense officials reaffirmed ongoing efforts to relocate the Republic of Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys. This  move  will  be  completed  in  FY  2023.  The  two  countries also  resumed  combined  field  training  at  the  battalion  echelon and above.

The armored BCT nine-month rotation program begun in 2015 continued with the arrival of the 1st BCT, 1st Armored Division, in South Korea in March 2022. This BCT replaced the 3d BCT, 1st Armored Division. In June 2022, however, the Army announced that  beginning in FY 2023 it will rotate a Stryker BCT to South Korea instead of an armored BCT. The equipment for an armored BCT will remain stored in Korea. The 75th Field Artillery Brigade continued to provide a rotational field artillery battalion equipped with  the  multiple-launch  rocket  system.  In  April  2022,  the  2d Battalion, 18th Field Artillery Regiment, replaced the 3d Battalion, 13th  Field  Artillery  Regiment.  The  Army  ended  its  rotation  of aviation battalions to South Korea during FY 2022 by permanently stationing a new battalion in the country. The 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was the last aviation battalion to rotate to the peninsula, replacing the 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, in September 2021. It concluded its rotation in June 2022, when the 5th  Squadron,  17th  Cavalry  Regiment,  was  activated  at  Camp Humphreys as part of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 2d Infantry

Division.  The  squadron  has  RQ-7B  Shadow  remotely  piloted aircraft and twenty-four AH-64E Apache helicopters.

## Operational Forces: U.S. Army Europe and Africa

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Army's presence in Europe expanded during FY 2022 to reassure NATO  (North  Atlantic Treaty Organization) allies, support Ukraine, and deter further Russian aggression. By April 2022, the service's  total  maneuver  force  in  Europe  consisted  of  two  corps headquarters,  two  division  headquarters,  three  armored  BCTs, one Stryker-equipped cavalry regiment, two airborne BCTs, and two combat aviation brigades. Artillery, logistics, and sustainment forces also moved to Europe. President Biden announced in June 2022 that the United States would establish a permanent garrison in  Poznań,  Poland,  where  V  Corps  had  its  forward  command element. The Army named the new installation Camp Kościuszko in honor of Col. A. Tadeusz B. Kościuszko, a Polish engineer who served with the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

Units began moving to Central and Eastern Europe before the 24 February invasion in response to the Russian buildup on Ukraine's borders. On 2 February, DoD announced that the XVIII Airborne Corps  headquarters  and  1,700  soldiers  from  the  82d  Airborne Division would deploy to Poland and Germany, respectively. The 2d  Squadron,  2d  Cavalry  Regiment,  moved  from  Rose  Barracks in  Vilseck,  Germany,  to  Romania.  On  11  February  2022,  DoD announced an increase to the number of 82d Airborne Division paratroopers who would deploy to Poland-some 3,000 personnel from the division headquarters and the 3d BCT. Two days before the invasion, U.S. military leaders said that the 2d Battalion, 503d Infantry Regiment, part of the 173d Airborne BCT in Italy, would deploy to Latvia and that the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade located in Germany would deploy two battalions of attack helicopters to the Baltics and Poland-the 1st Battalion, 3d Aviation Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 214th Aviation Regiment, respectively.

Paratroopers from the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 82d Airborne Division, participate in a combined arms live-fire exercise in Nowa Dęba, Poland, in March 2022.



After  Russia's  invasion,  the  United  States  moved  additional forces to Europe. The 1st BCT, 3d Infantry Division, an armored BCT located at Fort Stewart, conducted a no-notice deployment to Germany. The soldiers traveled without their heavy equipment, instead  drawing  it  from  Army  Pre-Positioned  Stock-2  sites  in Europe and then turning it in upon their departure. In March, an ordnance company from Fort Bragg, a maintenance company from Fort Stewart, and the 96th Transportation Company (bolstered by troops from the 297th Transportation Company) from Fort Hood deployed to various locations in Europe. The 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense  Artillery  Regiment,  deployed  Patriot  batteries  to  Poland in March and to Slovakia in April. The main body of the V Corps headquarters  deployed  from  Fort  Knox  to  Ansbach,  Germany,  in April.

Most units that had deployed to Central and Eastern Europe from the United States in early 2022 were replaced with fresh units during

the  summer.  In  June  and  July,  the  Headquarters,  101st  Airborne Division, and the 2d BCT, 101st Airborne Division, replaced their 82d  Airborne  Division  counterparts.  In  August,  the  3d  BCT,  1st Cavalry  Division,  deployed  to  Poland,  replacing  the  1st  BCT,  3d Infantry Division. In May, the 2d Battalion, 503d Infantry Regiment, had returned to Italy and the aviation battalions of the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade returned to their home stations in Germany. The 2d  Squadron,  2d  Cavalry  Regiment,  returned  to  Germany  later in 2022.

As part of Atlantic Resolve, the Army continued to deploy U.S.-based forces to Europe for nine-month rotations so that units could  improve  their  ability  to  operate  with  allied  and  partner militaries  through  multinational  training  events,  such  as  the Combined Resolve series of exercises. These rotations consisted of  a  division  headquarters  element,  an  armored  BCT,  a  combat aviation  brigade,  and  logistics  units.  The  1st  BCT,  1st  Infantry Division, completed its rotation in June 2022 and was replaced by the 3d BCT, 4th Infantry Division.

The Army conducted the third iteration of Defender-Europe, an annual, large-scale, multinational exercise for improving interoperability  with  allied  and  partner  militaries,  from  May  to early June 2022. Some 3,450 American and 5,200 other troops from 11 nations conducted near-simultaneous operations in 9 countries. The  1st  Infantry  Division  completed  two  wet-gap  crossings  in Poland.  The  169th  Field  Artillery  Brigade  (Colorado  ARNG) coordinated  a  multinational  live-fire exercise in Poland  and HIMARS live-fire exercises in Estonia and Denmark. Additional linked  and  associated  exercises  included  Flaming  Thunder  in Lithuania, Slovak Shield in Slovakia and Hungary, and Summer Shield in Latvia.

The  Germany-based 5th Battalion,  4th  Air  Defense  Artillery Regiment, completed tactical live-fire tests of the new Maneuver Short-Range  Air  Defense  system.  A  platoon  was  equipped  with the  system,  which consisted of a Stryker vehicle armed with the antiaircraft version  of  the  Hellfire  Longbow  missiles,  Stinger surface-to-air missiles, a 30-mm. cannon, and a 7.62-mm. machine

gun. Fielding of the system for the remainder of the battalion is expected to occur over the next year.

Army  forces  continued  other  rotation  programs  unrelated to  the  war  in  Ukraine.  In  February  2022,  the  81st  Infantry  BCT (Washington  ARNG)  deployed  the  1st  Battalion,  185th  Infantry Regiment,  to  relieve  the  3d  Battalion,  161st  Infantry  Regiment, in  Battle  Group  Poland.  The  53d  Infantry  BCT  (Florida  ARNG) provided  troops  to  replace  soldiers  from  the  81st  Infantry  BCT as  trainers  for  Joint  Multinational  Training  Group-Ukraine  in November 2021. These troops left Ukraine on 12 February 2022 but continued their training efforts in Germany. In August 2022, they handed  over  their  duties  to  soldiers  from  the  27th  Infantry  BCT (New  York  ARNG).  The  1st  Battalion,  66th  Armored  Regiment, replaced the 3d Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, in June 2022 at the Pabrade Training Area in Lithuania.

Since  FY  2017,  the  Army  has  deployed  a  reinforced  combat aviation brigade from the United States for a nine-month rotation in  Europe  to  supplement  the  12th  Combat  Aviation  Brigade.  In December 2021, the Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, handed over responsibility for this mission to the Combat Aviation Brigade,  1st  Cavalry  Division.  In  September  2022,  the  Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Armored Division, assumed this mission. Since FY  2018,  the  Army  has  deployed  an  air  defense  artillery  brigade headquarters  from  the  United  States  to  serve  as  the  air  defense mission  command  element  in  Europe.  The  174th  Air  Defense Artillery  Brigade  (Ohio  ARNG)  relinquished  this  mission  to  the 164th  Air  Defense  Artillery  Brigade  (Florida  ARNG)  in  October 2021. In June 2022, the 678th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (South Carolina ARNG) took over.

During FY 2022, soldiers participated in several annual multinational training exercises in Africa. From 15 to 28 February 2022, a total of 400 troops from Fort Bragg and 10 African countries conducted  the  special  operations-focused  Flintlock  exercise  in Côte d'Ivoire. The 2022 iteration of the Justified Accord exercise, which took place 28 February-19 March, saw 800 participants from the United States and 20 East African nations gather in Kenya and

Rwanda to  practice  interoperability  in  support  of  United  Nations and African Union peacekeeping operations. Some 7,500 personnel from  28  African  and  NATO  countries  conducted  battalion-level, special  forces,  and  humanitarian  training  during  June's  African Lion exercise in Morocco, Senegal, and Ghana.

There  were  several  smaller-scale  activities  and  operations  in Africa during the year. Soldiers from the 2d Security Force Assistance Brigade, who were training with the Ghana Armed Forces, helped deliver aid after a January 2022 accident involving mining explosives. On 23 January, a mortar attack on a French base in the city of Gao, Mali, wounded a soldier from the 2d Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces Regiment, who was leading a six-person team helping the  French  in  their  campaign  against  Islamist  insurgents.  Soldiers from  the  Italy-based  173d  Airborne  BCT  and  U.S.  Army  Southern European Task Force-Africa conducted joint training in February with their counterparts from the Marine Corps and Air Force as part of the North and West Africa Response Force. Fifty of the paratroopers also conducted a bilateral exercise with Tunisian paratroopers in March. In May, some 500 American troops reestablished a standing presence in  Somalia  to  help  that  nation's  armed  forces  combat  the  growing strength of al-Shabaab and other factions affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.

## Domestic Operations

At the beginning of FY 2022, the RA still had small teams of medical personnel at hospitals for assistance in dealing with the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus. In December 2021, the Omicron variant began to spread rapidly. In response, 1,000 additional active duty and reserve component  members  of  the  Army,  Air  Force,  and  Navy  deployed to  civilian  medical  centers  in  numerous  states.  The  teams  typically consisted of twenty to forty personnel. This mission ended by April, but some 200 individuals remained ready to deploy through the end of May in case of another virus surge.

In June 2021, DoD extended the military's Mexican border mission through 30 September 2022 after the Department of Homeland

Security requested its continued support. The Army capped this new force at 3,000 troops, consisting mostly of ARNG soldiers in a Title 10 status. These forces, under the control of U.S. Northern Command, primarily assisted Customs and Border Protection with intelligence and surveillance. By April 2022, approximately 2,500 soldiers supported these missions. In July 2022, the DoD, in response to another request from the Department of Homeland Security, authorized the continued deployment of up to 2,500 Title 10 National Guard military personnel to the border through the end of FY 2023. At the end of FY 2022, there were approximately 2,500 soldiers still deployed to the border. Since June 2019, the Army has assigned control over all these  forces  to  a  brigade-sized  headquarters.  In  October  2021,  the 149th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (Kentucky ARNG) assumed this mission from the 110th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (Missouri ARNG).

A surge in unaccompanied children crossing the Mexican border resulted  in  a  dramatic  rise  in  referrals  to  the  Department  of  Health and Human Services. In March 2021, that department asked DoD for assistance  with  accommodating  some  of  these  children  on  military installations. The largest facility for this mission, located on Fort Bliss, opened on 30 March with a capacity to care for up to 10,000 children. In May 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services converted the Fort Bliss site to an influx care facility-which provided only basic services such as food and clothing-and cut its capacity. By 30 September 2022, the facility had beds for 1,500 children and housed about 850.

The  DoD  continued  to  provide  the  Department  of  Homeland Security with housing, medical care, and general support for Afghan evacuees at military installations in the United States during FY 2022. This effort, known as Operation Allies Welcome, began on 30 July 2021, when the first Afghan evacuees reached Fort Lee, Virginia. Other Army installations used for this purpose during FY 2022 were Fort Bliss; Camp Atterbury Joint Maneuver Training Center, Indiana; Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey; Fort Pickett, Virginia; and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. The mission concluded when the last Afghan  refugees  departed  Joint  Base  McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst  on 19 February 2022.

## Reserve Components

## Organizational Structure

In  FY  2022,  the  ARNG  force  structure  had  thirteen  command and control headquarters: eight divisional, two expeditionary sustainment, and one each for military police, theater sustainment, and  air and  missile  defense.  It had  twenty-seven  BCTs:  five armored, twenty infantry,  and  two  Stryker.  There  were  forty-two multifunctional support brigades in the ARNG: eight aviation, eight field artillery (formerly fires), sixteen maneuver enhancement, and ten sustainment. There were fifty-seven functional support brigades and  groups.  The  force  structure  also  included  one  security  force assistance brigade and two special forces groups.

The  ARNG  Directorate,  located  in  Arlington,  reports  to  the National Guard Bureau. It develops and administers ARNG policies and programs, and consists of the Office of the Director, ARNG, and the ARNG Readiness Center, which is a field-operating agency of the  National  Guard  Bureau.  Additionally,  staff  from  the  Office  of the Chief, National Guard Bureau, provides support to the ARNG Directorate  in  areas  such  as  public  affairs,  legislative  liaison,  and contracting.  In  FY  2022,  the  ARNG  Directorate  had  766  military personnel and 861 civilian employees.

The  USAR  is  organized  under  a  single  general  officer  with staff  responsibilities  to  the  Department  of  the  Army  as  the  chief of USAR and command authority over most USAR soldiers as the commander, U.S. Army Reserve Command (USARC). The Office of the Chief of Army Reserve, located at Fort Belvoir, supports the chief of Army Reserve in advising the secretary of the Army and chief of staff of the Army on USAR matters. USARC, located at Fort Bragg, manages  USAR  operational  readiness  through  twenty-six  major subordinate commands.

Approximately  2,000  units  are  organized  into  22  functional commands  and  7  geographic  commands-3  mission  support

commands and 4 readiness divisions. Reserve personnel in Active Guard  Reserve  status  declined  from  16,671  at  the  beginning  of the  fiscal  year  to  16,413  at  the  end.  The  USAR  civilian  workforce, primarily military technicians, declined from 12,361 at the start of FY 2022 to 11,800 at the end of the fiscal year.

On  4  January  2021,  the chief of Army  Reserve  issued  a memorandum on Office of the Chief of Army Reserve and USARC reorganization, realignment, and reporting relationships that stated the two organizations are 'separate staffs with distinct roles, responsibilities,  and  reporting  relationships. '  She  directed  the  two entities  to  return  to  the  'two  staffs'  construct.  The  memorandum established  that  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Army  Reserve  justifies and executes the USAR budget, leads programming, manages the full-time support program, and interfaces between the component and HQDA.  USARC  serves as the USAR  operational staff, establishes policies for USAR functional and geographic commands, and  executes  USAR  operations  as  a  subordinate  of  U.S.  Army Forces Command.

The reorganization continued in FY 2022. In the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve, the G-1 established the Full-Time Support Directorate. The Surgeon Directorate and Chief Information Officer/G-6 Directorate realigned under the deputy chief of Army Reserve,  and  a  headquarters  formation  was  created  to  exercise administrative control over USAR soldiers in the National Capital Region. Changes in USARC included aligning the Equal Opportunity and  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Offices  under  the  chief  of staff, aligning the Contracting Administrative Support Office under the G-8, and moving the Army Reserve Installation Management Directorate to the USARC G-3/5/7.

## Mobilizations

During  FY  2022,  16,609  USAR  personnel  mobilized,  including 14,098 soldiers as members of 677 USAR units. The remainder went on  active  duty  as  individuals  under  Contingency  Active  Duty  for Operational Support status. The largest single mobilization in FY 2022

provided 1,550 personnel for Operation Allies Welcome. Central Command received the largest number of reservists, followed by U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command.

In  addition  to  the  2,319  ARNG soldiers who deployed to the Mexican  border  in  Title  10  federal  active  duty  status  during  FY 2022, the governors of Arizona and Texas continued to use soldiers from their state's ARNG on the border in Title 32 state active duty status. At the start of the fiscal year, 152 Arizona ARNG and 1,050 Texas ARNG soldiers were deployed on the border. By the end of April 2022, the number of Arizona ARNG soldiers had increased to more than 200 while the number of Texas ARNG soldiers had increased to more than 6,300. At the end of FY 2022, Arizona had increased the number of its soldiers on the border to 253, and Texas had reduced the number of its soldiers on the border to 5,055.

In FY 2022, the majority of ARNG units mobilized under Title 10 served outside of the continental United States ( Table 14 ).

## COVID-19 Pandemic Operations

More than 10,300 ARNG personnel were serving on missions related to the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of FY 2022. During the fiscal year, several governors activated ARNG soldiers for duty as school bus drivers and substitute public school teachers. Governors in  Arkansas,  Florida,  Idaho,  Massachusetts,  and  West  Virginia ordered ARNG soldiers to duty in state prisons, in part because of staff shortages created by COVID-19 illness and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among prison staff.

## Disaster Relief Operations

Hurricane  Ida  made  landfall  near  Port  Fourchon,  Louisiana,  on 29  August  2021  as  a  Category  4  hurricane.  Although  the  ARNG deployment  had  peaked  in  early  September  2021,  565  soldiers remained  on  active  duty  at  the  start  of  FY  2022.  The  mission

concluded in December 2021. Hurricane Fiona made landfall near Punta Tocón, Puerto Rico, on 18 September 2022, and, at the end of the fiscal year, 472 Puerto Rico ARNG soldiers remained on active duty in response to the storm. Hurricane Ian made landfall near Cayo Costa in Florida on 28 September 2022 as a Category 4 storm. By 30 September, 5,731 ARNG soldiers had been mobilized in response from  Florida,  Tennessee,  Louisiana,  Mississippi,  Montana,  North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and New York.

Several  winter  storms  necessitated  ARNG  state  active  duty mobilizations. At the start of FY 2022, seven states had soldiers on active duty fighting wildfires; at the end of the fiscal year, three states had a total of 296 soldiers on wildfire operations. Multiple states used their ARNG soldiers for tornado relief assistance. Spring flooding in Minnesota required activations of its ARNG, and, in July 2022, the Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia ARNGs deployed aircraft and troops to eastern Kentucky after severe flash flooding.

## Readiness

In  April  2022,  the  chief  of  Army  Reserve  published  a  paper on  changing  the  USAR's  readiness  culture  from  one  reliant  on quantitative forms of assessment to one focused on tough, realistic, and safe training. The emphasis on meeting administrative metrics had impeded the recruiting, developing, and retaining of cohesive teams and units fit to accomplish their wartime mission. In August 2022, USARC issued Operation Order 22-054, which shifted USAR readiness  from  the  Ready  Force  X  model  to  the  Army  Reserve Mission Force model. The new model established six categories of readiness, five of which are based on the type of mission with which a unit is aligned, while the sixth is for units not aligned to a specified mission and therefore available for unexpected contingencies.

The  USAR  conducted  two  iterations  of  its  combat  support training  exercise,  the  culminating  event  for  ReARMM  Collective Training  Year  2  units.  Combat  Support  Training  Exercise  22-01, held in June 2022 at Fort Hunter Liggett, California, and Combat

Support  Training  Exercise  22-02,  held  in  August  2022  at  Fort McCoy,  Wisconsin, included 83 units and 7,028 soldiers. A Warrior exercise  for  ReARMM  Collective  Training  Year  1  units took place in July 2022 at Fort McCoy. Thirty-two units with 2,297 soldiers undertook training focused on individual and squad-level proficiency.  Additionally,  115  USAR  units  participated  in  combat training center rotations.

In addition to overseas training deployments and the two BCT combat training center rotations, the ARNG took part in Operation Northern Strike, a biannual National Guard Bureau-sponsored training  exercise.  The  August  2022  iteration  at  Camp  Grayling, Michigan,  had  approximately  7,400  participants  from  19  states and Canada, Latvia, and the United Kingdom. Major ARNG units involved  were  Ohio's  37th  Infantry  BCT  and  174th  Air  Defense Artillery  Brigade.  Other  major  training  events  for  ARNG  units during  the  fiscal  year  included  four  Exportable  Combat  Training Center  rotations,  two  division  W arfighter  exercises,  and  five brigade W arfighter exercises.

The  National  Guard  Bureau  administers  the  State  Partnership Program, which pairs U.S. states and territories with other countries, enabling ARNG personnel and units to build long-term relationships by  conducting  regular  military-to-military  activities  and  various exercises  with  partner  nations.  These  interactions  occurred  both during large-scale combatant command multinational exercises and in other venues.

## Cyber

During  FY  2022,  several  states  ordered  ARNG  cyber  specialists to  state  active  duty.  At  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  fifty-five  ARNG cyber  specialists  were  on  state  active  duty.  Another  183  were  on federal active duty supporting U.S. Cyber Command. In June 2022, the  National  Guard  held  Cyber  Shield  22,  an  unclassified  cyber training exercise, at the ARNG Professional Education Center, Camp Joseph  T.  Robinson  Maneuver  Training  Center,  Arkansas.  More than 800 National Guard soldiers and airmen, along with civilian experts and members of the other military services, participated. The exercise  trained  and  tested  cyber  specialists  in  computer  network internal defensive measures and cyber incident response.

## Civil Unrest

The  District  of  Columbia  National  Guard  is  unique  in  that  the president, not the city's mayor, controls it via a chain of command that runs through the DoD. Authority to activate the D.C. National Guard is delegated by the president to the secretary of defense and further delegated to the secretary of the Army. In November 2021, the  DoD  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  released  a  report  on  its review of the DoD's role, responsibilities, and actions to prepare for and respond to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on 6 January 2021 and its aftermath. Regarding the mobilization of the D.C. National Guard  on  6  January,  the  review  concluded  that  DoD's  actions, including those of the secretary of the Army and members of the Army Staff, were appropriate, supported by requirements, consistent with  the  DoD's  roles  and  responsibilities  for  defense  support  to

civil  authorities,  and  compliant  with  laws,  regulations,  and  other applicable guidance.

## Logistics

## Management

In  May  2022,  an  Army  directive  redefined  and  clarified  the  roles and  responsibilities  for  the  service's  modernization  efforts.  In conjunction  with  the  establishment  of  AFC  in  2018,  the  Army had  issued  several  directives  designed  to  define  the  roles  and relationships between AFC and the other organizations engaged in  modernization.  To  create  initial  momentum,  these  directives prioritized  AFC's  functions  and  areas  of  responsibility.  This guidance, however, primarily addressed roles arising early in the equipping  life cycle, when  requirements  evolve  and experimentation takes place. It did not account adequately for the shift in roles and functions that occurs when requirements move into development and then become programs of record through production, fielding, and sustainment. Moreover, language in these directives created ambiguity regarding the primacy of authorities vested in the Army Secretariat that preserve civilian oversight and control of acquisition matters.

The  new  directive  rescinded  Army  Directives  2018-15  and 2020-15.  It  made  the  ASA  (ALT)  responsible  for  the  overall supervision of acquisition, logistics, sustainment, and technology matters  and  the  management  of  the  Army  Acquisition  System. The ASA (ALT) also oversees Army research and development, including science and technology efforts and associated resourcing decisions.  The  ASA  (ALT),  as  the  Army's  acquisition  executive, carries out all authorities, functions, and duties of the secretary of the Army with respect to the acquisition workforce.

Futures  Command  is  now  responsible  for  force  design  and force development and is the capabilities developer and operational architect  for  the  future  Army.  The  command  assesses  the  future operational  environment,  emerging  threats,  and  technologies  to provide  soldiers  with  the  concepts  and  force  designs  they  need

to  dominate  the  battlefield.  It  also  oversees  the  Army's  research laboratories and centers.

U.S. Army Materiel Command is responsible for ensuring that sustainment and logistics issues related to acquisition programs are addressed  throughout  the  acquisition  life  cycle.  It  supervises  the service's organic industrial base. Training and Doctrine Command is responsible for developing new operational doctrine as the service modernizes its formations. The command's Combined Arms Center and centers of excellence support AFC in force development. The directive designated HQDA's deputy chief of staff, G-3/5/7, as the Army's 'lead integrator and synchronizer across force modernization time horizons. '

In February 2022, the deputy chief of staff, G-4, was suspended from duty pending the results of an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General into complaints of counterproductive leadership. The  investigation  substantiated  the  allegations,  issued  a  general officer letter of reprimand, and removed the G-4.

## Support for Ukraine

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Office of the ASA (ALT) worked with the Office of the Secretary of Defense and congressional staffs to develop legislative proposals supporting Ukrainian  efforts  to  repel  the  invasion.  These  proposals  will  be incorporated in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2023. Additionally,  because  the  proposals  provide  temporary  statutory relief from certain acquisition and contracting requirements, domestic stocks transferred to Ukraine can be replenished more easily.

The U.S. government provided Ukraine with significant amounts of materiel, much of it from Army stocks. Among the most important transfers were  indirect  fire weapons  and  related  items:  M142 HIMARSs,  155-mm.  howitzers,  counterfire  radars,  and  artillery and  mortar  ammunition.  Antiarmor  weapons  supplied  included Javelin  missiles  and  tube-launched,  optically  tracked,  wire-guided missiles. Vehicles sent included M113 armored personnel carriers,

trucks,  and  Humvees.  Other  materiel  provided  included  Stinger antiaircraft missiles, individual and crew-served weapons, small arms ammunition,  body  armor,  communications  equipment,  medical supplies,  and  night  vision  devices.  Wherever  possible,  the  Army intends to replace the donated materiel, such as 155-mm. howitzers, with newer models or better equipment, such as HIMARSs.

## Research, Development, and Acquisition

The Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) is a heads-up display  with  a  body-borne  computer  pack,  conformal  wearable battery, squad radio, and integrated sensors. An April 2022 report from  the  DoD  inspector  general  criticized  the  Army  for  not defining  minimum  user  acceptance  levels  to  determine  whether IVAS would meet user needs. In June 2022, the Army conducted an  IVAS  operational  demonstration  at  Fort  Bragg.  The  infantry company testing the system had more success in accomplishing their operational  missions  with  their  current  equipment  than  with  the IVAS. Soldier acceptance of the system remained low. After the test, the Army adjusted its acquisition and fielding strategy for the system to provide the contractor time to improve reliability and develop a new form factor. The service now intends to field 5,000 IVAS 1.0 models with improved reliability  and  5,000  IVAS  1.1  models  that meet the reliability requirement and are equipped with an improved low-light sensor. The IVAS 1.2 variant will be the full-rate production system, incorporating an improved form factor.

In April 2022, the Army announced the selection of a contractor for  the  next-generation  squad  weapons,  which  will  be  issued  to infantry,  scout,  and  combat  engineer  squads.  The  XM7  rifle  will replace the M4 carbine. The XM250 automatic rifle will replace the M249  squad  automatic  weapon.  Additionally,  the  contractor  will produce a new 6.8-mm. family of ammunition for the XM7 and the XM250. The rest of the Army will continue to use the M4 carbine.

During FY 2022, the Army continued testing active protection systems  for  the  M1  Abrams  tank  and  the  M2  Bradley  fighting vehicle. These systems detect and intercept antitank guided missiles

and  rocket-propelled  grenades.  During  Phase  III  testing  of  the Trophy  system  installed  on  M1A2  Abrams  System  Enhancement Package Version 3 tanks, it intercepted most of the incoming threats, and  the  Abrams  tank  base  armor  provided  adequate  protection in  basic  range  conditions  and  engagements. The Army conducted Phase II effectiveness and survivability testing of the Iron Fist Light Decoupled system installed on M2A4 Bradley vehicles. Although the system demonstrated improved performance over Phase I results, it continues to have effectiveness deficiencies.

The  armored  multipurpose  vehicle  is  the  replacement  for  the M113  family  of  vehicles  in  armored  BCTs.  During  FY  2022,  the

Army tested it at Fort Greely, Alaska, and the Tropic Regions Test Center in Panama. Full system-level live-fire testing, begun in May 2021, concluded in May 2022. For the initial operational testing and evaluation of the system in July 2022, units from an armored BCT used the armored multipurpose vehicle in tactical missions while operating in an electronic warfare and cyber-contested environment. The Army will use data from FY 2022 testing when making a fullrate production decision in the second quarter of FY 2023.

Army  Integrated  Air  and  Missile  Defense  is  a  system  that integrates  sensors,  weapons,  and  a  common  mission  command interface  across  an  integrated  fire-control  network.  In  January 2022,  the  Army  split  the  program's  initial  operational  testing  and evaluation into two phases because of known software deficiencies. The  service  held  the  first  phase  of  testing  from  January  through March 2022. After the program used the agile software development process to mitigate known software deficiencies, the second phase began in August 2022, with completion expected in October 2022.

The Army will use data from FY 2022 testing when making a fullrate production decision in the second quarter of FY 2023.

In  January  2022,  the  Army  decided  to  field  Command  Post Computing  Environment  Increment 1. This system provides hardware  and  mission  command  software  for  use  on  generalpurpose  client  computers  in  tactical  operations  centers  from  the battalion to the corps echelons. Increment 1 is the planned evolution of  the  already  fielded  Increment  0.  It  corrects  deficiencies  noted with  Increment  0,  interfaces  with  more  data  sources,  and  shares information with joint and coalition partners using the Multilateral Interoperability Programme standard.

The  infantry squad  vehicle will provide mobility on  the battlefield for light infantry squads. The Army fielded the vehicle to two infantry BCTs during FY 2022 using low-rate initial production quantities.  Modifications  are  underway  to  address  reliability  and maintainability deficiencies  identified  in  previous  testing.  Testing to validate corrective actions began in June 2022 and is scheduled for completion in February 2023. The unavailability of production representative  vehicles  forced  the  postponement  of  unit  airdrop operations, scheduled for September 2022, to FY 2023. The full-rate production decision is scheduled for March 2023.

Currently, infantry BCTs do not have a vehicle with a protected, direct-fire capability. The Mobile Protected Firepower program will produce an armored tracked vehicle with a 105-mm. main gun for use against light armored vehicles, fortifications, and dismounted troops.  Two vendors provided prototypes, and, in June 2022, the Army selected one for low-rate initial production. Following testing, a full-rate production decision is expected in FY 2025.

The  Mounted  Assured  Positioning,  Navigation,  and  Timing System  will provide ground  forces position-navigation-timing information  in  environments  that  degrade  or  deny  access  to  the Global  Positioning  System  and  feature  electromagnetic-spectrum interference  or  enemy  jamming  and  spoofing.  It  will  replace the Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver. Developmental  testing  continued  in  FY  2022,  and  the  program transitioned from prototyping under an other transaction authority

contract  to  an  Acquisition  Category  II  program  of  record  at Milestone C in June 2022.

Testing of robotic ground combat vehicles and concepts for their use  continued  in  FY  2022.  Project  Origin  provided  the  opposing forces at the Joint Readiness Training Center and  the Joint Multinational Readiness Center with robotic combat vehicle surrogates for use against units training at the centers. Tasks assigned to  the  vehicles  included  denying  helicopter  landing  zones,  route reconnaissance, obstacle breaching, and  transporting  weapons and  supplies.  Project  Origin  also  worked  with  soldiers  from  the 1st  Special  Forces  Group  at  Dugway  Proving  Ground,  Utah,  in experiments, which included firing weapons from the vehicles.

In  FY  2022,  the  3d  Battalion,  67th  Armored  Regiment,  at Fort  Stewart,  became  the  first  unit  to  complete  the  field-level maintenance and operator new equipment training programs for the M2A4 Bradley fighting vehicle. The M2A4 has enhanced mobility and  power-generation  capabilities,  which  will  permit  installation of future electronic technologies in the vehicle. The Army plans to purchase more than 700 M2A4s through 2029.

## Foreign Military Sales

The  Army's  Foreign  Military  Sales  program  is  part  of  the  overall U.S.  Defense  Security  Assistance  program.  It  oversees  the  sale  of ground forces equipment, training supplies, and services to foreign countries, strengthens bilateral defense relationships, and improves interoperability between U.S. forces and foreign partners.

During  FY  2022,  the  Army  worked  with  the  Office  of  the Secretary of Defense to address challenges facing the program. Sales in  FY  2021 had been 31 percent lower than in FY 2020, marking the second consecutive year of decline. Additionally, FY 2021 had the  lowest  volume  of  sales  since  2016.  FY  2022  ended  with  new agreements valued at more than $14 billion and more than 6,200 open cases valued at $218 billion across 134 countries.

The Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, in its annual assessment for  FY  2022  found  that  installation  readiness  was  still  at  risk  and would  remain  so  through  FY  2026.  Factors  affecting  readiness included  reduced  sustainment  funding,  personnel  shortages,  and increasing facility requirements.

The  assistant secretary of the Army  (installations, energy, and  environment)  and  the  G-9  approved  the  Army  Installations Strategy Implementation Plan in June 2022. The plan moves Army installations toward the strategy's stated goal of resilient, sustainable installations by 2035. The thirty-two tasks in the plan are organized in four lines of effort. The first line of effort, 'Take Care of People, ' encompasses modern facilities, services, and safe operations. The second is to 'Enhance Readiness and Resilience' by implementing solutions for protection, resilience, mission assurance, education, and training. The third, 'Modernize and Innovate,' looks for new ways to provide services and find efficiencies. The fourth, 'Promote Stewardship,'  cares  for  natural  resources  through  sustainability, remediation,  and  technology  innovation,  and  includes  climate change mitigation and adaptation. The plan will be updated every two years.

In August 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, published  a  revision  of  Army  Regulation  15-8, Army Stationing and Installation Plan ,  superseding the 2009 version. The revision established  the  Army  Stationing  and  Installation  Plan-Secret  as the official source for classified planning populations by location and fiscal year. It also assigned to Army Materiel Command the responsibility for reviewing Army Stationing and Installation Plan reports and submitting recommended changes.

During  FY  2022,  the  Army  conveyed  thirty-four  acres  that were declared either excess or were part of the Base Realignment

and  Closure  process.  These  transfers  completed  the  conveyance of  all  excess  property  at  Fort  Meade,  Maryland,  the  former  Fort McPherson,  Georgia,  and  the  closed  Badger  Army  Ammunition Plant in Wisconsin. Base Realignment and Closure leases and land sales  generated  $5.3  million  revenue,  which  the  Army  used  to fund environmental cleanup projects at installations closed by the process. The service used revenues from other land sales and leases to  resolve  environmental  liabilities  of  remaining  excess  Army property at twenty-four installations.

## Housing, Construction, and Infrastructure

The Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) is the Army's partnership with private companies to build and maintain almost all onpost family housing. A public scandal in FY 2019-which exposed that these companies failed to provide required maintenance and repair services and frequently disregarded tenant complaintsresulted in an Office of the Inspector General review of the RCI. Congress then included in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020 a 'Tenant Bill of Rights' for military service members and their families who reside in on-post privatized housing.

An  April  2022  report  by  the  Senate  Homeland  Security  and Governmental  Affairs  Permanent  Subcommittee  on  Investigations detailed one RCI contractor's continued failure to provide required maintenance  and  repair  services  and  frequent  disregard  of  tenant complaints.  One  of  the  affected  installations  was  Fort  Gordon. In  response,  the  assistant  secretary  of  the  Army  (installations, energy, and  environment)  directed  Army  Materiel  Command's commanding general to conduct an Article 15-6 investigation of the subcommittee's findings and the issues described by a former resident at the subcommittee's April 2022 hearing. In coordination with the investigation,  the  Army  conducted  a  third-party  audit  of  the  Fort Gordon work orders and maintenance requests.

Congress  mandated  that  each  service  conduct  an  independent qualified home inspection and assessment of all RCI housing. In FY 2022, a contractor conducted a pilot inspection program for the Army

at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade, and the service expects to award a contract for inspecting the remaining housing inventory in FY 2023.

In FY 2022, the Army continued its program to renovate or replace  deficient  family  housing.  Its  goal  is  to  eliminate  required nonexcess  Q3  (poor  condition)  or  Q4  (failing)  family  housing  by FY 2024, with no families living in Q4-rated housing by the end of FY 2024. The Q rating system assesses facilities and computes the ratio of the cost of repairing the facility to the facility's plant replacement value.

In  the  FY  2022  annual  housing tenant satisfaction survey, RCI housing received a 73.7 percent satisfaction rating, down from the 75.4 percent rating in FY 2021. Government owned or leased family housing  had  a  satisfaction  rating  of  72.3  percent,  a  decrease  from the  72.9  percent  rating  in  FY  2021.  Survey  respondents  identified issues  related  to  maintenance  services-including  response  times, communication,  follow-up,  and  long-term  solutions-among  their top concerns. During FY 2022, Fort Bragg soldiers living in barracks built  in  the  1970s  on  Smoke  Bomb Hill posted images of mold in the barracks on social media and made complaints to a member of Congress and the secretary of the Army. The sergeant major of the Army inspected the affected buildings in July 2022. Officials at Fort Bragg stated that the barracks' air conditioning systems frequently

leaked, were unable to cope with the often humid conditions in the area, and were too expensive and complicated to maintain or replace. They faulted outdated tracking software for the failure to grasp the systemic nature of the problem. The mold had been handled in an ad hoc manner by cleaning or evacuating individual rooms. In late July, the Army decided to remove all soldiers from the barracks, demolish twelve  of  the  buildings,  and  refurbish  another  five.  The  service allocated $115 million for demolition and renovation and awarded contracts for the work before the end of FY 2022. In September 2022, soldiers at Fort Stewart posted videos of mold in their barracks on social media platforms.

In November 2021, residents at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawai'i, reported a fuel smell in their tap water. Investigation found that the Navy's Red Hill fuel storage facility had been leaking into the aquifer, which supplies potable water for much of the base. The contamination also affected soldiers and their families living at Red Hill  and  on  the  Aliamanu  Military  Reservation.  In  response,  the Army stood up Task Force Ohana, which delivered bottled water to residents, established distribution points for water drawn from a well on  Schofield  Barracks,  and  operated  shower  facilities.  It  relocated affected families to nearby hotels and provided medical screenings.

Families  returned  to  their  homes  once  the  Hawai'i  Department  of Health declared the drinking water safe for all household uses. The department  lifted  its  water  advisory  for  Red  Hill  in  February  and for the Aliamanu Military Reservation in March. That same month, the  secretary  of  defense  directed  the  Navy  to  empty  and  close  the fuel facility.

## Public Affairs

In December 2021, the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs published the  2023 Army  Communications  Plan in  support  of  the Army Campaign Plan .  It  emphasized four storylines: 'Building the Army of 2030, ' 'Possibilities, ' 'Making a Difference, ' and 'My Army Life. ' The first major revision of Army public affairs doctrine since 2014, FM 3-61, Communication Strategy and Public Affairs Operations , was published in February 2022.

Coverage  of  Army  birthday  celebrations  in  June  2022  reached 441.7 million people globally and 291.6 million nationally through social media. The number of units sharing Army birthday content increased  from  13  in  2021  to  130  in  2022.  There  were  more than 30,000 engagements with Army-affiliated social media content  creators,  50  local  news  media  segments,  and  148  radio broadcast segments.

The Army has five official social media accounts. In FY 2022, these accounts had 565.5 million users, and total followers grew by 6.4  percent  to  11.6  million.  The  service's  Y ouTube  following  grew by 63 percent, from 204,000 to 555,000, making the Army the top YouTube channel within the DoD. The Army Trademark Licensing program  had  316  licensees  across  a  wide  spectrum  of  goods  and generated $2.3 million in royalties.

## Legislative Liaison

In FY 2022, the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison facilitated visits by 99 congressional delegations and 148 congressional staff  delegations  to  various  sites  and  received  more  than  9,750

congressional  inquiries.  It  also  oversaw  preparation  for  twentyeight general officer confirmation hearings and aided Army leaders with their appearances before Congress. In May 2022, staff from the office assisted the first Senate delegation to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion. One topic of major congressional interest was the DoD COVID-19 vaccine mandate and the subsequent separation from the service of soldiers who refused to be vaccinated. The office answered  numerous  inquiries,  letters,  and  oversight  committees' questions regarding this subject.

## Chaplain Corps

In FY 2022, the Chaplain Center and School became the U.S. Army Institute for Religious Leadership. The institute has four components: the  Religious  Support  Operations  Center,  the  Religious  Leadership Academy,  the  Graduate  School,  and  the  Noncommissioned  Officer Academy.  Its  mission  is  to  train  unit  ministry  teams-chaplains  and

religious affairs specialists-in safeguarding the free exercise of religion for all service members and their families as well as in the provision of religious support and religious accommodation.

The  Chaplain  Corps  continued  the  Spiritual  Readiness  Initiative begun in FY 2020. Spiritual readiness has taken on more significance as part of the Army's Holistic Health and Fitness program, which promotes a body-mind-spirit approach to building peak performance in soldiers. The Army defines spiritual readiness as the development of the personal qualities needed for responding to life's stressors, adversity, and hardship. During FY 2022, the Office of the Chief of Chaplains, in collaboration with the Army's  Behavioral  Health  program,  conducted  thirteen Spiritual Readiness Initiative events for more than 3,200 participants.

During FY 2022, the Chaplain Corps worked on transforming the Strong Bonds program, which trains soldiers and their families to build and  maintain  good  personal  relationships,  into  the  Building  Strong and  Ready  Teams  program.  The  new  program  has  a  dual  focus  on enhancing Army teams and strengthening soldiers and families. While it will continue to offer relationship training, its scope will broaden to include spiritual readiness, holistic health, and community partnerships with  organizations  inside  and  outside  the  Army  that  support  soldier and  family  holistic  health.  These  changes  are  scheduled  to  occur  in October 2022.

In  FY  2022,  the  Chaplain  Corps  received  451  applications  and selected 424 chaplains and chaplain candidates. Of the 424 chosen, 111 joined the RA, 53 became ARNG chaplains, 99 joined the USAR, and the remaining 161 became chaplain candidates in the ARNG and the USAR. The religions of  those  selected  saw  some  change  in  FY  2022. In FY 2021, Catholics made up 1.11 percent of the selected applicants, which increased to 5.66 percent in FY 2022. The percentage of selectees who identified as members of low-density faith groups (which include religions such as Judaism and Islam) rose from 4 percent to 10.14 percent.

A  contractor  study  sponsored  by  the  Office  of  the  Chief  of Chaplains on religious affiliation among RA enlisted soldiers found that the proportion of Protestants increased from FY 2000 to FY 2015, and then began to decline modestly after FY 2015. Within Protestants, the  share  of  enlisted  soldiers  who  identify  as  nondenominational

Protestant  has  been  growing  substantially,  while  the  number  who identify with most other denominations has been declining in recent years.  The  proportion  of  Catholics  has  declined  steadily  since  FY 2005, and the proportion of those having no religious preference fell between FY 2000 and FY 2015 but has increased since.

## Safety

In FY 2022, 82 soldiers and 1 civilian employee died in accidents, the second consecutive fiscal year with a record-low number of accidentrelated  fatalities  in  the  Army.  Of  the  68  soldiers  killed  in  off-duty mishaps, 60 died in private motor vehicle accidents. There were 111 Class A accidents-another historically low number-which involve fatalities,  permanent  disabilities,  $2  million  or  more  of  property damage, or loss of an Army aircraft. For the third consecutive fiscal year, Army Aviation remained below a rate of one Class A mishap per 100,000 flying hours for crewed aircraft, and, for the first time, no aircrew members died in an aircraft accident during a fiscal year. Uncrewed  aircraft  had  a  Class  A  mishap  rate  of  10.32  percent  in FY 2022.

To  improve  collection  of  safety  data,  the  U.S.  Army  Combat Readiness  Center  and  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Army  Safety created  the  Mishap  and  Near  Miss  Reporting  Tool  to  replace  the outdated  ReportIt  system.  Safety  officers  report  the  mandatory data elements for each incident, and the new tool collects the data, offering increased visibility on safety risks and trends. In FY 2022, the tool recorded 7,178 mishaps and 1,038 near misses.

The Army launched SafetyNet in 2021 with fewer than 50 users, but by the end of FY 2022, the number of users had risen to more than 3,100. This online community allows participants to exchange information  and  create  discussions  about  preventing  mishaps  in seven  communities:  Aviation,  Career  Program  12,  Off  Duty,  On Duty Ground, Tools, Training and Education, and Workplace.

In FY 2022, the Office of the Director of Army Safety conducted special-interest  surveys  at  Redstone  Arsenal,  Alabama;  Fort  A.  P . Hill,  Virginia;  McAlester  Army  Ammunition  Plant,  Oklahoma;

Yuma Proving Ground; and U.S. Army Pacific. The special-interest survey  program  assesses  implementation  and  effectiveness  of  the Army Safety Program in high-risk areas such as ammunition and explosives,  chemical  agents,  radioactive  materials,  and  radiationgenerating devices.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspected 88 Army facilities in FY 2022, resulting in a total of 124 violations, none  of  which  the  Army  appealed.  The  most  commonly  cited violations  included  electrical  wiring,  portable  fire  extinguishers, maintenance, and safeguards for exit routes.

## Army and Air Force Exchange Service

The Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) is the largest retailer  for  the  DoD,  operating  more  than  4,900  post  exchanges, convenience stores, restaurants, gas stations, military clothing stores, and movie theaters in all fifty states, more than thirty countries, and in  four  U.S.  territories.  It  also  provides  a  website  for  shoppers  to choose from more than two million items. The sale of goods and services funds most of the operating budget; federal appropriations provide 3 percent for transporting goods. Approximately 60 percent of AAFES earnings support DoD quality-of-life programs. In June 2022, AAFES reported that in calendar year 2021 it had generated $205 million for these programs. The Army's share of this dividend was $111 million.

AAFES introduced features across its facilities to promote the 'BE FIT' initiative that encourages healthy lifestyles. Among these were  healthier  options  in  its  restaurants  and  convenience  stores and  stocking  athleticwear  and  sporting  equipment.  Its  facilities supported Afghan refugee resettlement efforts on installations that were  part  of  Operation  Allies  Welcome.  A  joint  services  board voted  to  partner  with  AAFES  in  consolidating  authentication services  for  DoD  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR) online libraries. Previously, each military service used separate contractors to provide authentication services. Now,  all service members and their families can access these services via the AAFES online

authentication system to create a library account with their common access card. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, AAFES, the Marine Corps Exchange, and the Navy Exchange Service Command offered  free  lunches  under  the  student  meal  program  to  students at DoD Education Activity schools outside the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture child nutrition COVID19 waiver expired on 30 June 2022, and the three exchanges resumed charging for student meals at the start of the 2022-2023 school year.

## Morale, Welfare, and Recreation

The  Army's  Family  and  MWR  program  provides  family,  child, and youth programs, and recreation, sports, entertainment, travel, and  leisure  activities  for  soldiers,  Army  families,  and  retirees.  It oversees  libraries,  dining  facilities,  movie  theaters,  fitness  centers, swimming  pools,  bowling  alleys,  golf  courses,  childcare  centers, and  youth  centers.  Other  MWR  offerings  include  arts  and  crafts programs,  travel  programs,  outdoor  recreation  services,  concerts and  entertainment,  sports  and  fitness  programs,  tutoring  and educational  support,  babysitter  training,  childcare  fee  assistance, automotive maintenance and training, financial services, relocation planning, and employment assistance.

Affordable  childcare  is  crucial  to  sustaining  Army  readiness. During FY 2022, installation childcare centers ran at capacity, and soldiers struggled to find affordable daycare in their communities. In FY 2021, the Army had received congressional approval for its plan to increase childcare capabilities, which included five new childcare development centers. The Army continued to implement this plan in  FY  2022  and  also  offered  several  incentives  for  attracting  and retaining childcare center staff.

## Special Functions

## The Surgeon General

The Office of the Surgeon General is responsible for all health and medical matters of the Army, including medical aspects of training, organizing, and equipping the Army. The surgeon general is also the commanding general of MEDCOM.

In  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Acts  for  FYs  2017  and 2019,  Congress directed the military services  to  eliminate  what  it saw as duplicated services and establish a single, integrated military healthcare  system  by  transferring  control  of  medical  treatment facilities to the DHA. The Army completed its transfer of medical treatment  facilities  and  dental  treatment  facilities  to  the  DHA  by the end of FY 2021. During FY 2022, MEDCOM transferred 27,929 civilian personnel and local national employees to DHA in waves in July, August, and September.

From  September  2019  through  September  2021,  MEDCOM provided direct support to DHA as the agency established structure and  functions  across  the  organization.  Upon  termination  of  the direct support agreement, DHA was not at full operational capability and required continued support for certain headquarters functions. MEDCOM and DHA then entered into agreements for support of six specific headquarters functions for FY 2022: (1) civilian personnel, (2)  dental,  (3)  Lean  Six  Sigma,  (4)  medical  libraries,  (5)  security guards, and (6) SHARP.

After ceremonies  in  September  2022,  MEDCOM  officially redesignated its four regional health commands as medical readiness commands, effective  1  October  2022.  U.S.  Army  Regional  Health Command,  Atlantic,  will  become  U.S.  Army  Medical  Readiness Command, East; U.S.  Army  Regional  Health  Command,  Central, will  become  U.S.  Army  Medical  Readiness  Command,  West;  U.S. Army Regional Health Command, Europe, will become U.S. Army Medical  Readiness  Command,  Europe;  and  U.S.  Army  Regional

Health Command, Pacific, will become U.S. Army Medical Readiness Command,  Pacific.  The  medical  readiness  commands  provide medical forces, health service support, and force health protection. They  also  provide  command  and  control  for  medical  department activities, medical centers, and the Army Recovery Care Program's soldier recovery units.

The Medical Specialist Corps created twenty-seven installation support teams in FY  2022 for networking, mentorship, and professional  education,  which  are  led  by  the  most  senior  Medical Specialist Corps officer on each installation. To increase the number of occupational therapists, in FY 2022, eleven students began the Army's first degree-producing  occupational  therapy  doctorate  program, which was conducted in collaboration with Baylor University.

In  May  2022,  the  director  of  the  Army  Staff  initiated  an assessment  of  risks  affecting  the  health  of  equids  that  are  Armyowned or reside on Army installations. Military working equids are horses, mules, and donkeys that are used primarily for ceremonial missions by caisson horse platoons, memorial cavalry detachments, and mounted color guard units. The deaths from colic of two horses in  the  caisson  platoon  of  the  1st  Battalion,  3d  Infantry  Regiment (The Old Guard), within four days of each other earlier in the year prompted the assessment. As of May 2022, across twelve installations, the  Army owned 190 working equids, the MWR program owned 47, and there were 3 official equine mascots. The Veterinary Corps served  as  the  lead  for  Task  Force  Military  Working  Equids, which made two-day staff assistance visits to every installation with military  working  equids  and  one  installation  with  MWR-owned horses  between  June  and  August  2022.  The  report  from  the  task force included recommendations to improve the care and feeding of equids, to hire professionally qualified people to care for them, and to obtain expanded pastureland.

## The Army Audit Agency

The  Army  Audit  Agency  provides  independent  internal  auditing services  for  all  Army  operations  and  programs.  The  agency  has

an operations center at Fort Belvoir and sixteen field offices in the continental United States, Hawai'i, Germany, and South Korea. In FY 2021, the agency developed a strategic plan to further clarify and  improve  its  goals  and  services.  From  FY  2022  through  FY 2026, the agency will follow this plan to transform itself into a more responsive organization.

In FY  2022,  a process action team  analyzed  the  current organizational structure of the agency as well as external forces that may influence its structure. From that analysis, the agency developed a new structure that included a fourth operational deputy auditor general. Published in FY 2022, the agency's strategic human capital plan has five lines of effort: (1) Human Capital Data Management and  Workforce  Planning,  (2)  Acquire  Talent,  (3)  Develop  Talent, (4) Employ Talent, and (5) Retain Talent.

In  FY  2022,  the  agency  published  seventy-nine  audit  reports, identified more than $1.5 billion in potential monetary benefits, and included more than 260 recommendations for improving operations across the service. Among the subjects covered in the reports were assigning officers using the Army Talent Alignment Process, Army data center optimization, and Army medical reform.

## Office of Army Cemeteries

The  Office  of  Army  Cemeteries  formulates  and  oversees  policies, doctrine,  plans,  and  standards  for  Army  cemeteries.  It  establishes and maintains gravesite accountability; provides technical guidance, training, staff assistance, and inspections; adjudicates burial exceptions, disinterments, and expansion requests; and handles other issues of concern. The Army National Military Cemeteries, comprising Arlington National Cemetery and the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, is a direct reporting unit to HQDA.

In  FY  2022,  the  Office  of  Army  Cemeteries  conducted  six inspections of Army cemeteries. It received and approved twentyseven disinterment requests. The  West  Point Cemetery  Land Reclamation and Development Project, when completed, will add 3,492  gravesites.  The  project  began  in  October  2019  and  had  a

projected  completion  date  of  June  2022.  Concerns  over  drainage, depth and material composition in cremation sections, and numbering of the columbarium niches led to an extension of the project, and completion is now expected in December 2022.

In  Pennsylvania,  the  Carlisle  Barracks  Disinterment  Program continued  its  work  to  exhume  the  remains  of  Native  American children who died at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and return them to their tribes. In FY 2022, the fifth year of the project, the Office of Army Cemeteries  received  eight  such  requests  from  the  Washoe  Tribe, the Oneida Nation, the Ute Tribe, the Alaskan Natives, the Catawba Nation,  and  the  Umpqua  Tribe.  The  office  returned  seven  sets  of remains. The remains in the grave annotated as a student from the Catawba Nation were determined to be biologically inconsistent with the  student  identified  for  disinterment  and,  therefore,  the  remains were not returned. This grave is now marked as unknown.

Arlington  National  Cemetery  conducted  5,886  interments  in FY  2022.  Infrastructure  improvements  included  the  rebuilding  of roads and stormwater lines. The cemetery completed restoration and preservation of the exterior doors at the Memorial Amphitheater. In November 2021, the cemetery commemorated the centennial of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Nearly 90,000 people attended the two-day Flowers of Remembrance program that allowed the public to lay a flower at the base of the Tomb for the first time since the 1940s.

## Civil Works

In  December 2021, the  Corps  of  Engineers  began  the  Fire  Island to Montauk Point flood risk management project on Long Island, New York. The first part of the project involved moving more than 1.5  million  cubic  yards  of  sand  from  the  Fire  Island  inlet  to  the updrift  and  downdrift  beaches  to  reduce  erosion  and  strengthen coastal resiliency.

In March 2022, the Army announced a formal review of Nationwide  Permit  12-Oil  or  Natural  Gas  Pipeline  Activities.  Previous uses of the permit have raised concerns about environmental justice,

impact on climate change, impact on drinking water, and proper notice to affected communities. In May 2022, the Army announced a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a federal credit program administered by the Corps of Engineers for maintaining, upgrading, repairing, and removing dams identified in the National Inventory of Dams as being owned by nonfederal entities. The program enables local investment in dam-safety infrastructure projects for creditworthy borrowers.

In July 2022, the Army signed a project partnership agreement for the Caño Martín de Peña ecosystem restoration project in Puerto Rico. The project will restore part of the San Juan Bay Estuary system by reestablishing the tidal connection between the San Jose Lagoon and the San Juan Bay. The project includes dredging approximately 2.2 miles of the Caño Martín de Peña, creating shoreline stabilization and erosion control features, and planting approximately 35 acres of mangroves.

The Corps of Engineers responded to several hurricanes during FY 2022. One of its most important services was Operation Blue Roof, in which contractors installed reinforced plastic sheeting on roofs  damaged  by  hurricanes.  Other  missions  included  installing

emergency power, supporting temporary housing facilities, conducting infrastructure assessments, and providing debris removal assistance to state governments.

## Environmental Protection

In June 2022, the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, published the Army Environmental Restoration Plan for FY 2022-2026. The plan provides a framework for transforming the costs of environmental restoration  into  investments  to  improve  the  service's  operational capabilities. It covers environmental restoration at installations of all three components and facilities affected by the Base Realignment and Closure program.

Per-  and  polyfluoroalkyl  substances  (PFAS)  are  a  large  group of  humanmade  chemicals  that  have  been  developed  for  many applications worldwide since the 1950s, including in the firefighting foam  used  on  military  installations.  In  2016,  the  Environmental Protection  Agency  issued  a  lifetime  health  advisory  for  perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid in drinking water. The

Army has been investigating 341 locations, four of which were added in  FY  2022,  under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act for known or suspected use, storage, or release of PFAS or PFAS-containing materials. The service is on track  to  complete  preliminary  assessments  and  site  inspections  by the  December  2023  deadline  established  by  the  National  Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022. In June 2022, the Army published a  plan  to  replace  aqueous  film-forming  foam,  a  suppressing  agent containing PFAS, which is used to extinguish liquid fuel fires, with non-PFAS materials by October 2024.

## Chemical Weapons Demilitarization

The chemical weapons demilitarization program eliminates chemical warfare  materiel  in  accordance  with  obligations  specified  at  the Chemical  Weapons  Convention.  The  program  destroyed  nearly 90 percent of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile by 2012 and then dismantled and closed the associated chemical weapons destruction facilities over a three-year period. The remaining stockpiles of this

materiel are at Pueblo Chemical Depot, Colorado, and Blue Grass Army Depot, Kentucky.

The  Blue  Grass  Army  Depot  destroyed  the  last  M55  rockets containing VX nerve agent in April 2022. Destruction of the last M55 rockets containing GB nerve agent at the depot is expected in 2023. In  February  2022,  the  Pueblo  Chemical  Depot  began  destroying 4.2-inch  mortar  shells  containing  blister  agent,  and,  in  July  2022, the  depot  destroyed  the  last  105-mm.  artillery  shells  containing blister agent. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2016 set  31  December  2023  as  the  deadline  for  destruction  of  all  U.S. chemical weapons.

## Criminal Investigation Division

The reorganization of U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command into the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID), begun in FY 2021, continued in FY 2022. As part of the reorganization, CID redrew  its  geographic  areas  of  responsibility  to  increase  the  level of oversight of investigations and operations, and, by August 2022, all  the  geographic  field  offices  were  operational.  Each  now  has  a civilian special agent-in-charge with the civil service grade of GS-15 and  a  GS-14  assistant  special  agent-in-charge.  In  January  2022, CID  headquarters  established  the  Investigations  and  Operations Directorate for centralized oversight of investigations and increased standardization of investigative processes across the division. During FY  2022,  the  directorate  changed  policies  to  permit  increased investigative freedom  and  to  decrease  administrative  burdens, allowing special agents to spend more time on investigations.

To increase the number of its civilian agents, CID determined that it had to change from a competitive service hiring authority to an excepted service hiring authority. This will allow for most new agents to begin at the GS-7 to GS-11 grades with the goal of progressing to  GS-13.  The  broader  pool  of  applicants  created  by  this  change allows recruitment from different areas with different skillsets and experiences, such as local and state police, recent college graduates, and former DoD employees. This new policy, however, is likely to

put CID into direct competition with other federal law enforcement agencies for recruits.

Between  2005  and  2012,  the  ARNG  and  USAR  recruiting assistance  programs  paid  service  members  up  to  $2,000  for  each person they referred who successfully enlisted in these components. Accusations of fraud in the program prompted an investigation. In June 2022, CID began to review the cases of individuals who, during this investigation, may have been placed in the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index, and in some instances, in the FBI (Federal Bureau  of  Investigation)  Interstate  Identification  Index,  without meeting the appropriate criteria to warrant those actions.

## Provost Marshal General

Fielding  of  the  upgraded  Automated  Installation  Entry  system continued.  The  system  validates  identification  credentials  against authoritative databases, allowing security guards to quickly determine if an identification card is expired or has been reported lost  or  stolen,  or  if  the  bearer  has  restrictions  regarding  access. During  FY  2022,  the  Automated  Installation  Entry-4  system  was fielded at twenty-eight installations.

During  FY  2022,  the  Army  conducted  222  patrol  explosive detector  dog  missions  in  support  of  the  U.S.  Secret  Service  and the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  The  military  working  dog  program supported  an  additional  539  missions  during  the  fiscal  year.  The total number of military working dog missions increased 10 percent compared to the FY 2021 total.

In FY 2022, 264 deserters returned to military control. Seven of these were on the Army's most wanted fugitive list. At the end of the fiscal  year,  the  Army's  Deserter  Apprehension  program  had  1,101 active warrants for alleged deserters.

## The Judge Advocate General

The Judge Advocate General's Corps had 1,827 judge advocates in the  active  component,  2,523  in  the  reserve  components,  and  757

civilian  attorneys in FY 2022. Nearly 30 percent of all active duty judge  advocates  were  women,  and  minority  officers  accounted for  18  percent  of  the  Judge  Advocate General's Corps' active duty attorney strength.

The U.S. Army Trial Defense Service provides defense counsel services for Army personnel whenever required by law or regulation. These services are provided free of charge to soldiers facing courtsmartial,  nonjudicial  punishment,  and  administrative  separation from the service. During FY 2022, 140 active duty military defense counsels, operating out of 42 field offices, represented soldiers at 563 courts-martial and 22,000 administrative separations and consulted on 47,000 other military justice matters.

At the end of FY 2022, the Army had 92 special victims' counsels representing  clients,  62  full-time  and  30  part-time,  both  in  the continental U.S. and overseas. They provided legal counsel to clients who reported as victims of sex-related or domestic-violence offenses. The  counsels  assisted  2,265  clients,  conducted  33,643  counseling sessions, attended 3,433 interviews, and represented clients at 260 administrative hearings and 285 courts-martial.

Clients for legal assistance personnel in FY 2022 totaled 54,724: 29,863 enlisted personnel, 8,843 officers,  8,940  retirees,  and  7,078 others.  Among  the  clients  were  88,400  soldiers  pre-  and  postdeployment in soldier readiness programs, 427 victims of domestic abuse, and 117 people concerning special education.

In May 2022, the Advocacy Center opened on Fort Belvoir. With seven mock courtrooms, it is the only DoD training center for trial attorneys. Nearly twenty-six weeks of the center's training calendar are dedicated to hosting courses previously held at contracted facilities.

In FY 2022, 305 records of trial and more than 1,000 motions and briefs were referred to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA) for judicial review. Of those 305 cases, ACCA received 277 for the first time (not a remand from the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces  or  returned  from  the  convening  authority  after  remand). The court processed all 277 cases under Military Justice Act of 2016 procedures involving an entry of judgement; none were processed under prior procedures involving a promulgating order. In 145 of

these 277 cases, ACCA completed the certification of the record of trial within 120 days. ACCA received 194 of the Military Justice Act cases within 30 days of the completion of certification of the record of trial or entry of judgement. ACCA rendered an initial decision in 315 cases in FY 2022, with an average processing time of 225 days from receipt of the record of trial by the clerk of court to decision by ACCA. Of the 315 decisions, ACCA issued 305 within the 18-month period prescribed by United States v. Moreno .

In FY 2022, military judges of the Army Trial Judiciary presided over 615 original courts-martial, a 13 percent decrease from FY 2021. Of the cases tried in FY 2022, 153 were fully contested, 49 involved mixed pleas, 276 were guilty pleas, and 137 were terminated prior to findings. Of the cases in which findings were entered, 220 included sexual  misconduct-related  offenses,  a  2  percent  decrease  from FY 2021.

At the end of FY 2022, the Army had 185 pending courts-martial cases, 57 of which were referred for trial by courts-martial, with the remainder  pending  disposition  decisions.  Tables  15  through  20 present data on cases completed in FY 2022.

## Historical Activities

The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  2021  directed the secretary of defense to establish a commission to examine the assignment, modification, or removal of names, symbols, displays, monuments, and paraphernalia of DoD assets that commemorate the Confederate States of America or any person who served voluntarily with  the  Confederate  States  of  America.  It  required  the  secretary of defense, no later than three years after the date of its enactment, to implement the plan submitted by the commission for removing from  all  DoD  assets  anything  that  honors  or  commemorates  the Confederate States of America or any person who served voluntarily with the Confederate States of America. During FY 2022, the Army supplied  the  commission  with  a  small  staff  for  administrative and  logistical  support.  The  U.S.  Army  Center  of  Military  History

provided the commission with historical support. In August 2022, the commission submitted its recommendations concerning the U.S. Military Academy and the nine Army posts named for Confederate officers. The support team was disestablished at the end of September 2022 after the commission completed its work.

The commission's recommendations concerning the U.S. Military Academy were to:

- · Rename Beauregard Place, Lee Barracks, Lee Housing Area, Lee  Area  Child  Development  Center,  Lee  Road,  Lee  Gate, and Hardee Place.
- · Relocate or remove a portrait of Robert E. Lee in Confederate uniform hanging in Jefferson Hall and Reconciliation Plaza, a memorial honoring Confederate troops.
- · Modify  or  remove  a  triptych  painting  in  Bartlett  Hall honoring Confederate troops.
- · Remove 'Honor Plaza,' a monument engraved with the West Point honor code alongside a quote from Robert E. Lee.

The  commission  recommended  renaming  the  nine  posts  as follows:

- · Fort Benning, Georgia, will become Fort Moore, after Army Lt. Gen. Harold Gregory 'Hal' Moore Jr. and his wife, Julia Compton Moore.
- · Fort Bragg will become Fort Liberty.
- · Fort Gordon will become Fort Eisenhower, after General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower.
- · Fort A. P . Hill will become Fort Walker, after Medal of Honor recipient Dr. Mary Edwards Walker.
- · Fort  Hood will  become Fort Cavazos, after  Army General Richard E. Cavazos.
- · Fort  Lee  will  become  Fort  Gregg-Adams,  after  Lt.  Gen. Arthur J. Gregg and Lt. Col. Charity E. Adams-Earley.
- · Fort Pickett will become Fort Barfoot, after Medal of Honor recipient Col. Van T. Barfoot.
- · Fort Polk will become Fort Johnson, after Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. William Henry Johnson.

- · Fort  Rucker,  Alabama,  will  become  Fort  Novosel,  after Medal of Honor recipient Chief Warrant Officer 4 Michael J. Novosel.

The commission estimated that renaming these posts will cost $21 million.

In September  2022, the commission  submitted  its report concerning other DoD assets. Regarding the Army, the commission recommended allowing the ARNG's 29th Infantry Division to keep its blue-and-gray  division  patch  created  in  1917  but  suggested removing any mention of the Civil War and reunification of Northern and Southern states from its description maintained by the Institute of  Heraldry.  The  commission  concluded  that  the  division  should keep the patch in recognition of its valorous service in the world wars.

The  commission  recommended  removing  ARNG  unit  battle streamers commemorating the Confederacy. Current policy authorizes units to display streamers for federal service in named campaigns,  which,  since  1949,  has  included  streamers  for  Civil War battles in which the unit had served in the Confederate army. For the Confederate Memorial in Section 16 of Arlington National Cemetery, the commission recommended removing the thirty-two statues from the top of the monument but not removing the entire monument so as to prevent damage to the graves underneath it.

Implementation  of  the  commission's  recommendations  will begin in FY 2023.

## 9 Conclusion

In  FY  2022,  the  COVID-19  pandemic's  effects  on  the  service lessened. Some  soldiers and  civilian employees  rejected the requirement  that  all  Department  of  the  Army  personnel  be vaccinated  against  the  disease.  This  refusal  led  to  involuntary separations from the RA for some soldiers. Several governors, who refused to enforce this requirement in their state's National Guard, filed lawsuits against the DoD.

The  Army  faced  a  major  challenge  in  FY  2022  with  its  worst recruiting year since the return of the all-volunteer force in 1973. All  three  components  fell  short  of  their  objectives  by  substantial margins.  The  service  implemented  various  measures  to  address this issue, most notably the Future Soldier Preparatory Course. The factors  affecting  recruiting,  however,  suggest  that  the  Army  will encounter serious impediments to meeting its objectives in FY 2023.

The  demand  for  Army  forces  from  combatant  commands remained high in FY 2022 and continued to exceed the RA 's capability, so the service again relied on the reserve components to accomplish all of its missions. The most important of these in FY 2022 was the U.S. government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It included a significant expansion in the size of Army forces deployed to Europe and the use of Army facilities in Europe to train Ukrainian personnel. To  support  Ukrainian  forces  defending  their  nation,  the  United States  transferred  to  them  large  amounts  of  weapons,  equipment, ammunition, and supplies from Army stocks. At the same time, the Army examined the war's operations for lessons that could be useful in its preparation for large-scale combat operations.

Modernization remained a high priority in FY 2022. The Army redefined  and  clarified  roles  and  responsibilities  for  managing  its modernization efforts. It published a digital transformation strategy. Revisions  in  doctrine  and  organizations  supported  the  return  of the  division  as  the  decisive  unit  of  action  for  large-scale  combat

operations. Exercises and experiments examined new concepts and materiel. The Army Climate Strategy described how the service will adapt to climate change.

The service invested considerable resources in implementing the Army  People  Strategy .  It  expanded  talent  management  programs, sought to promote greater inclusion, worked to decrease the number of suicides, and took action to raise the quality of life for soldiers and their families, especially in Alaska. It also reformed the SHARP program and, in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act  for  FY  2022,  established  the  Office  of  Special  Trial  Counsel. Modernization of several personnel systems, however, failed to meet their designed capabilities.

The Army ended FY 2022 without an approved budget for FY 2023.  The  congressional  continuing  resolution  that  enabled  the Army to operate in the new fiscal year extended funding based on FY 2022 levels.
